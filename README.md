# Detecting Evidence of Gender Discrimination in Fijian Court Documents

#### Chris Sexton and Greg Tozzi | August, 2020

*Advances in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques provide practitioners with an expanded set of options for document classification. This paper lever- ages recent research in this area, applying convolutional neural networks and BERT variants against a challenging real world dataset to evaluate how well these approaches perform against traditional machine learning approaches. We show that, for these data, state-of-the-art techniques can enjoy real advantages over more traditional techniques, but the effect is smaller than one might expect.*

### Files in this Repo

Each numbered file corresponds to a section in the report.  Section 6 (Explainability) does not have any unique code but draws on results elsewhere in the files.  Most files are divided into `notebooks`, `models`, and `archive` folders.  The `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that directly support the text.  The `archive` folders contain many notebooks that explore areas we chose not to write about.  The `archive` folder at the top level of the repo contains work that did not fit neatly into any section.
