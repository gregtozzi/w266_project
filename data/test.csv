80646,"SENTENCE

[Name of the victim is suppressed. She will be referred to as JPP]

01. The Director of Public Prosecution had preferred the following charge against the accused above named.

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence 

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

Timoci Aluseni on the 14th day of September 2012, at Savusavu in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of JPP with his finger without JPP's consent.

02. After trial on the charge, the accused was found guilty of the charge. Accordingly he was convicted of committing Rape. 

03. According to victim while she was playing after school in her compound the accused called her and poked his finger in to her vagina. She was five years old at that time. Medical examination done on the same day revealed her hymen is partially intact and her perineum and labia minora are slightly inflamed.

04. Accused took up the position that never poked his finger into victim's vagina and therefore denied the charge. 

05. As per section 207(1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009 the maximum sentence for an offence of Rape is to imprisonment for life.

Tariffs for Rape

06. In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:

""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent... the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must...reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008), the court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & others HAC 0008 of 1996, the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

In the case the complainant was a child at the time of the incident. Hence the tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 15 years. See Mark Mutch v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; the actual sentence will defend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

In State v AV [2009] FJHC24: HAC 192.2008(2 February 2009) the court stated:-

""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children. Children are our future. The courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences."" 

07. The accused is 45 years of age. He is the sole bread winner of the family. He is married has two children. He is in the remand for about 11 months.

08. In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person""

09. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

10. Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

11. The objectives of sentencing, as found in section 4(1) of the Decree, are as 
follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;
	2.	To protect the community from offenders;
	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or
	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

12. Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a Court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;
(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;
(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;
(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

13. Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The victim is 05 years old at the time of the offence.
	2.	The victim is emotionally disturbed.
3. The act done to the victim by the accused person took away the victim's dignity in the society.

14. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

	1.	Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family.
	2.	Accused is 45 years old and a carpenter by profession.
	3.	He has two children 
	4.	He has been in remand since 14/09/2012.
	5.	He has no relatives in Vanua Levu and has been estranged from his family whilst in remand. 

15. Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I take 10 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add 04 years for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 14 years. I deduct 02 years for the mitigating factors.

16. You have been in remand since 14/09/2012. You have rib fracture. Considering all these I deduct further 02 years from your sentence.

17. Now your sentence is 10 years imprisonment.

18. Your counsel request from this court not to set parole period. You have committed the offence on a girl who was 05 years old. You took away her dignity in the society. You put her future in dark.

19. Considering all and acting in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 08 years as non-parole period.

20. 30 days to appeal.

81372,"JUDGMENT

This is an appeal against conviction and sentence. The Appellant was charged with criminal trespass, indecent assault and damaging property. On the 26th of September 2005, he waived his right to counsel and pleaded guilty on all counts, after they had been explained to him.

The facts were that on the 24th of September 2005, the Appellant entered the house of one Ilisoni Lagi, at Lami Village. In the house was seventeen-year old Lusiana Bola, a form 5 student of Wesley College. She asked him to leave the house. He held her neck, dragged her into the bedroom and offered to have sexual intercourse with her. When she refused, he touched her breast. She freed herself and ran out of the house. The Appellant then took a wooden stick beside the sitting room window and damaged the sewing machine belonging to the complainant’s mother. The complainant was alone in the house during the incident. The Appellant smelt of liquor. He was later arrested and interviewed. He admitted trespassing into the compound of Ilisoni Lagi, and damaging the sewing-machine. However he said he could not recall the indecent assault as he was very drunk at the time. The Appellant admitted these facts and was convicted.

He was a first offender, and a 28 year old labourer living in Lami. He asked for leniency saying that he was looking after his parents.

The sentencing remarks read as follows:

“The court cannot pass a lenient sentence in this sort of circumstances.

Count 1 – Sentenced to 3 months imprisonment.

Count 2 – Sentenced to 1 year imprisonment.

Count 3 – Sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.”

The sentences were all to run concurrently with each other.

The grounds of appeal are that the Appellant was wrongly convicted on the counts of trespass and indecent assault as he had not committed the offences and that the sentences were harsh and excessive in the light of the Appellant’s previous good record.

In his written submissions, the Appellant said that he committed the offences under the influence of alcohol, and as a result of peer pressure. He outlined his family circumstances saying that he was the sole breadwinner in his family with two sisters still at school.

State counsel opposed the appeal against conviction and said that because the sentences fell within their respective tariffs, that a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment was not harsh or excessive.

I cannot agree. It is correct that the record clearly shows unequivocal pleas of guilty from which there can be no appeal. It is also correct that the sentences individually are not wrong in principle in that they fall within the tariffs for the offences. However, the sentence of 2 years imprisonment was harsh for damaging property when there was no evidence of the extent of the damage, and when this was clearly not the worst type of offending for criminal damage.

Further a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment for a 28 year old first offender is excessive and inappropriate. The courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment.

In this case, I would maintain the sentence on Count 2 of 12 months imprisonment. Although the victim was young and in her own home, this was a case of fleeting indecency and not one warranting a longer sentence. The tariff for indecent assault is 1 to 3 years imprisonment. The sentence of 2 years on Count 3 is however clearly excessive. It is reduced to 1 year and all sentences must be served concurrently with each other. The sentence on Count 1 remains the same. The total term of 12 months imprisonment is to be suspended for a period of 12 months, the period of suspension to run from the 26th of September 2005, to account for the period already served.

This appeal is allowed.

73669,"JUDGMENT

1. On 13 May 2008, the Appellant, William Raymond Robert Bennion, was convicted after trial in the First Class Magistrates Court at Sigatoka of 3 counts of defilement of a girl under 13 years of age, contrary to section 155 (1) and (3) of the Penal code.

2. On 6 August 2008, the Appellant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, with each other. 

3. The Appellant now appeals against sentence.

4. At the hearing of this appeal, the following issues were considered.

i. Time of presentation of the petition to the Sigatoka Magistrates Court; and

ii. If the appellant wanted to appeal against conviction as well.

Time for presenting the petition

5. The court records show that the Appellant, who is unrepresented, prepared his own petition. His petition was prepared from Prison and is dated 4 August 2008. The petition was received by the Sigatoka Magistrates Court on 11 August 2008, that being 3 days outside of the 28 days for presentation prescribed by s.310 (1) Criminal Procedure Code.

6. The position of Appeals out of time was stated by the Court of Appeal in Vimal Construction & Joinery Works Limited & Others v. Vinod Patel & Co Ltd [2008] ABU 0081 of 2006S where the Court held at paragraph 15:

""In 2008 litigants should not assume that leave will be given to bring or maintain appeals or other applications where those appeals or applications are out of time unless there are clear and cogent reasons for doing so.""

7. This judgment was referred to again by the Court of Appeal in Woodstock Homes (Fiji) Ltd v. Sashi Kant Rajesh Civil Appeal No. ABU 0081 of 2006S where the Court held at paragraph 65:

""However, as held by this Court in Vimal Construction & Joinery Works Limited & Others v. Vinod Patel & Co Ltd [2008] ABU 0081 of 2006S, litigants should assume that leave to bring or maintain appeals or other applications where those appeals or applications are out of time will not be given unless there are clear and cogent reasons for delay. ""Merit"" of an appeal or proceeding, without more, will rarely justify an extension of time except where the delay is minimal and no prejudice was occasioned by the delay.""

8. The Applicant says that his appeal is against sentence only. He does not wish to amend his petition and appeal against conviction as well.

9. The applicant says that this appeal should be allowed for the following reasons:

1. The delay in filing the petition was due to the Prison authorities failing to ensure that his petition was presented on time;

2. His sentence is too harsh, given that the offences occurred in 2000;

3. In 2006, he suffered from a spinal injury; and

4. His grandson is presently being cared for by his son and daughter in law, who both suffer from mental illness.

9. The prosecution say that in this case, a sentence of 2 years was lenient. They say similar cases have attracted prison terms from 3 to 4 years. 

10. In his sentencing remarks, the learned Magistrate considered the case of State v Roqica & Others Criminal Appeal No. HAA 037 of 2002, where Shameem J refers to an earlier decision and states that ""sentence for the defilement of girls between the ages of 13 and 16 range from a suspended sentence for ""virtuous friendship"" offending to 3 to 4 years imprisonment where the offended is older and in a trusted position in relation to the victim.""

12. In this case, the learned Magistrate took 2 years of imprisonment as the starting point as there were 3 counts. He then took into account the mitigation submitted by the Appellants legal counsel, and reduced the sentence by 6 months. The learned Magistrate held that the accused was not entitled to any further reduction as he did not plead guilty.

13. The learned Magistrate then gave due consideration to the following aggravating factors. At the time of the offence, the Appellant was 40 years of age. The complainant was just 12 years of age. The Appellant was in a relationship with her mother, and they all lived in the same home. Given the complainants age, she was entitled to treat the Appellant as the trusted head of the family who could be called upon to provide protection and care. 

14. However, the Appellant was found to have prayed upon the complainant’s vulnerability. For these reasons, the learned Magistrate added 6 months to the sentence, bring it to 2 years.

15. The learned Magistrate considered whether or not it was appropriate to suspend the sentence. After considering the affect that these proceedings had had on the complainant, and the offence itself, the learned Magistrate ordered that the sentence be immediate.

16. The Applicants petition was presented out of time. The Court of Appeal has ruled that litigants should not assume that leave to bring or maintain appeals will be given unless there are clear and cogent reasons for delay. I appreciate that while in prison, the Appellant must rely on the Prison authorities to ensure that his petition was presented in time. As the delay is minimal, and the matter of presentation is out of the Appellant’s control, I am willing to enlarge the period of limitation from 28 days to 31 days.

17. Having carefully considered the arguments presented by the Appellant and the Prosecution, I find that the Appeal against sentence is without merit. I therefore dismiss the appeal.

80139,"JUDGMENT
[1] On the 17th July 2012 in the Nasinu Magistrates Court, the respondent was convicted after trial of rape, contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Chapter 17 Laws of Fiji. He was sentenced on the 25th January 2013 to 8 years' imprisonment, a sentence which was partially suspended in that he was to serve weekends in the prison and weekdays at large in the community. There was no minimum term set before he was eligible for parole but a Domestic violence Restraining Order with no-contact and non molestations conditions was put in place.
[2] The State appeals the sentence on the grounds that:
(a) that the Magistrate erred in law in imposing a partially suspended sentence, and
(b) that the Magistrate failed to consider section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 in not imposing a non parole sentence. 
[3] The unique and disturbing facts of the case were rather clumsily summarized by the learned Magistrate as follows:
""The accused and the complainant are related as biological brother and sister. On the day in question, that afternoon, the victim was called by the accused to his home. The accused was acquainted by their parents regarding some lesbian behavior and stealing of money. He then questioned the victim regarding homosexual relationship (Lesbian) with a lady and stealing of $600 money which she denied. The accused was having party gathering and fully drunk at the moment. The victim was then assaulted and questioned. While in the process the victim urinated and passed feces(sic) because of fear and assaults. She was 22 years at that time. Then, on request of the accused's wife the victim had a bath and cleaned herself and then, she was taken into a room for counseling instead the accused ravished and raped her.""
[4] This brief and unhappily worded synopsis of the facts although rather perturbing in itself does not disclose the true facts of the case. According to the victim, the accused told her that he ""would do something to her to make her forget she was a lesbian"". She attempted to run away from him but he chased her onto the road and caught her; putting her in so much fear that it was then that she lost control of her bladder and bowels. He kept her in a locked bedroom for about three hours while he subjected her to sexual indignities. The accused confirmed the chase and the fact that she soiled herself but said he was too drunk to remember the rape. He did remember having sex with somebody but could not remember who with. At all times the accused's wife was in an adjacent room.
[5] It is not for this Court in this judgment to pass comment on those facts and they obviously speak for themselves. 
[6] In his sentence, the learned Magistrate in referring to authorities which would suggest an appropriate sentence of 15 years for the crime, quite properly found himself restricted to the Magistrates Court's maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and therefore took that figure as his starting point. He added two years to this for aggravating features which he found to be;
(i) the complainant being his sister
(ii) breach of trust between brother and sister
(iii)the victim being severely assaulted.
[7] He reduced that 12 year interim sentence by 4 years for mitigating features which he found to be;
""(i) First offender and ex Special Police Inspector
(ii) 33 years of age
(iii) Married with 4 children
(iv) Care giver of wife's 64 year old grandmother
(v) Matter hanging over his head for 5 years
(vi) you suffered humiliation and mental agony
(vii) you are totally remorseful of your actions
(viii) you seek suspended sentence.""
[8] These partially valid mitigating factors thus reduced the sentence to a term of 8 years, which was the final sentence that the Magistrate arrived at. He then went on to consider whether he could suspend the sentence, but quite properly found that by section 26(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (""the Decree"") he could not ""wholly suspend a sentence of more than two years"". (His emphasis). 
[9] The Magistrate then went on to consider other options he thought available under that Decree that would allow him to impose ""a lesser or alternative sentence "" pursuant to section 15(3) of the Decree as well as to satisfy what he perceived to be the objective for first offenders to ""bend over backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders"" (He adopted the words of the Court of Appeal in Prasad AAU0023.93).
[10] He concluded his sentence by stating that ""it is a sad and unfortunate incident, but he was so foolish and no proper judgment could be taken at that time due to his anomalous mind"" before proceeding to pass the partially suspended sentence of weekend imprisonment.
[11] Discussion.
This Court will proceed to consider the propriety of the suspension of sentence as well as the lack of minimum term which are the grounds of appeal, but will not comment on the final length of sentence for reasons soon to be apparent.
[12] Section 26 of the Decree reads as follows:
""26 - (1 ) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the Court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
(2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence-
(a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or
(b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrates Court.
(3)......
(4).......
(5)....... ""
[13] A sentence of 8 years clearly cannot be suspended because it exceeds the statutory maximum stipulated in subsection (2)(b) and the Magistrate has not stated under what authority he has seen to partially suspend the sentence. He states in his sentence that he cannot wholly suspend the sentence (his emphasis) leaving himself the option to partially suspend it, but the section does not make this distinction. The qualifying clause ""the whole or part of the sentence"" contained in 26(1) must logically follow through to subsection (2).
[14] I find that the Magistrate had no power to partially suspend the sentence, there being no provision in the Decree for a sentence of more than 2 years to be suspended either in whole or in part. The sentence of eight years must therefore be wholly served intra muros.
[15] The second ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Magistrate to set a minimum term, the State submitting that the imposition of a minimum term is mandated by the provisions of section 18 of the Decree. Section 18 reads:
18 - (1)Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
(2)If a court considers that the nature of the offence, or the past history of the offender, make (sic) the fixing of a non- parole period inappropriate, the court may decline to fix a non-parole period under sub-section (1).
(3)............
(4)............
(5).............
(6).............
(7)............. "" 
[16] Again, it is clear from the statutory provisions that although it is correct that a minimum term must be imposed, there is a discretion for the sentencer not to do so. The alternative is admittedly contradictory but it is within the sentencing tribunal's powers when the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender are taken into account. It is unfortunate that the Magistrate did not state any reasons for not imposing a minimum term because it is not known if he was turning his mind to the offence or to the offender and it would have been far better had he done so, but it is a discretion that an appellate court should not interfere with lightly.
[17] Having said that, I find that in declining to impose a minimum term under s.18(2) when mandated to do so by s.18(1), it must always be incumbent on the sentencer to provide reasons why he is doing so . Those reasons will either be the unusual nature of the offence or the special circumstances of the offender and nothing else. Failure to state the reasons will render the sentence invalid.
[18] The invalidity of the suspension restores the sentence of 8 years against this respondent and it is now for this court to set a minimum term. The State has not appealed the length of the 8 year term but this Court considers that in the unique and deplorable circumstances of this case, the 8 year sentence is manifestly lenient and totally inadequate. 
[19] The facts and circumstances of this case would warrant a sentence of at least 12 years imprisonment, and probably more and the Magistrate should have used his powers to transfer the accused to the High Court for sentencing pursuant to section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Decree. The Magistrate was well aware of the range of sentences this offence would attract when he referred to sentencing authorities at the beginning of his sentence. When he did that, it should have been quite apparent to him that the case was beyond the scope of his sentencing powers and transferred the case. 
[20] Section 256(3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree gives this Court the power to quash the sentence passed below and pass another sentence in substitution for the sentence as it thinks ought to have been passed, but that restricts this appellate Court to a maximum sentence of 10 years, which is the maximum sentence the Magistrate could have passed.
[21] This court is of the view that 10 years is still too lenient a sentence for the crime in the circumstances and would therefore adopt the following course: this Court sets aside the sentence passed below and by the terms of s.256(2)(e) of the Criminal Procedure Decree sends the case up to the High Court for sentencing; which is a procedure the Magistrate should have done at the time. 
[22] The State's appeal against sentence is allowed and I make the following orders:

	1.	The sentence passed below is quashed pursuant to section 256(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Decree.
	2.	The accused is sent to the High Court for sentencing pursuant to section 190(1) of that decree.
	3.	A copy of this judgment will be sent to the Chief Registrar of the High Court to satisfy the requirement of s.190(2) of that decree.

	4.	The case will be called before me at 10am on 15 July 2013 for the parties to make sentencing submissions and to address me in mitigation.

75140,"SENTENCE

Background 

1. The accused was charged for Attempted Murder and the charge reads as follows.

Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED MURDER: Contrary to section 44(1) and 237 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

SEKAIA TAGITECI on the 28th of June 2010 at Buavou, Seaqaqa in the Northern Division, unlawfully attempted to cause the death of LAILANI ROKOVONU.

Particulars of the Offence

2. The victim Lailani Rokovonu was the de facto wife of the accused. They have two small children by their de facto married life. There was Nacanieli Saini 4 year old and Siliva Rasue 3 year old. Both accused and the victim had domestic problems. As per the victim, the accused had suspected that the victim has an extra marital affair. On the faitful Saturday 09/06/2010 the victim and the accused were at the victim's parental house, and she woke up in the early morning to go to Buavou to attend a funeral. The accused was lying in the bed from the previous night's alcohol hangover. After she prepared the meals she went to the river to have bath. After having the bath when she got ready to return home the accused had gone there and started a quarrel. At that time their child Naca who was 4 years old was also there. The accused dealt a blow on the victim with his hands. On receiving the injury the victim had fallen down and seated in a disoriented position. The child was also fell and stayed there. The accused ran to the bank of the river and pulled out a cane knife from its hiding place and attacked vigorously on the victim. As per the accused, he aimed the neck. The victim prevented the blows with her hands. The accused has dealt several blows with the cane knife which resulted in severing the hand of the victim cut injuries on her breast, right hand and the highs. She was immediately rushed to Labasa Hospital and her bleeding was arrested. But her hand remained permanently amputated. Accused ran away from the place of the incident and subsequently arrested by the police.

Law

3. Now I consider the Law.

a) Section 44(1) states as follows:

""A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency.""

b) Section 237 of the Crime Decree

A person commits an indictable offence if-

i) the person engages in conduct; and

ii) the conduct causes the death of another person; and

iii) the first-mentioned person intends to cause, or is reckless as to causing, 

the death of the other person by the conduct.

Penalty-Mandatory sentence of Imprisonment for life, with a judicial discretion to set a minimum term to be served before pardon may be considered. 

Sentence 

4. Sentence is set out on section 237 of the Crimes Decree as per the above section is mandatory sentence of imprisonment for life time.

Tariff

5. Now I consider the tariff to the offence of Attempted Rape.

6. In the case of State v Samy [2007] FJHC 78; HAC029S.06 (29 November 2007) the accused pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted murder. According to the facts the accused attacked her mother, the brother and a cousin with a chopper all the three victims sustained serious injuries. One of the victims lost two fingers as result of the impact of the chopper. Her Ladyship Justice Shameem in deliberating her sentence reflected on the weapon used, the seriousness of the injuries and that it was premeditated. The accused entered in his diary that he was going to kill his mother, brother, sister and brother in law them commit suicide. Hence her Ladyship sentenced the accused to 9 years imprisonment.

7. In the case of State v Atik [2010] FJHC 199; HAC045.2009 (10 June 2010) his Lordship Justice Madigan sentence the accused to 6 years imprisonment for beating the wife with a knife. When delivering his judgment the learned judge took into consideration that there was some degree of planning. 

8. The case of Prasad v State [2008] FJCA 48; AAU111.2007S (8 August 2008) the court of appeal took into consideration that the learned judge took into account a 9 year for the starting point for the offence of attempted murder. The facts are, the appellant tried the victim to a tree then poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. The judge sentenced the accused to 8 years imprisonment.

9. In the case of Ledua v State [2008] FJSC 31; CAV0004.2007 (17 October 2008) the Supreme Court reduced a 10 years sentence for attempted murder to 9 years.

10. In the case of State v Sharma [2009] FJHC 62; HAC045.2008 (4 March 2009) the court acknowledge that a starting point of 9 years is appropriate for the charge of murder.

""The usual starting point for attempted murder is a nine year prison term; State v Rajendra Sami HAC029S.06; State v Bobby Hemant Prasad HAC52 of 2007. In those two cases a sentence of 9 years and 8 years were imposed respectively.""

Subsequently the appellant was given an 11 sentence.

11. In State vs Annamallay (2005) FJHC 100; HAC0004J.2004B (4 May 2005). Justice Shameem states that the tariff for Act to Cause Grievous Harm punishable under section 224 of the Penal Code is between suspended term to 2½ imprisonment.

12. Considering all above case Laws the tariff is between suspended term to 9 years imprisonment. 

13. Considering the facts of the case, it was very brutal attack on a woman who is unarmed and with a child in the morning hours of the day invites me a serious consideration so I commence your sentencing at 5 years imprisonment.

14. You acted as a wild beast and cut your wife in front of your little child.

15. On the invitation of your counsel, I perused your cautioned statement to police. I wish to reproduce some of the portion as below.

Q112: What happened after that?
A: I punched her with my right hand.

Q115: What about Naca?
A: They both fell down.

Q116: When she fell down did she stand up again?
A: She was shocked by the punched so she sat down.

Q119: What was your wife doing when you run for your knife?
A; She was sitting down on the river maybe she was dizzy because of the punch I gave her.

Q122: Who knife was it?
A: Mine.

Q123: Who hide the knife there?
A: Myself.

Q125: Why did you hide the knife there?
A: I always hide it there because it is easier to use.

Q133: That simply means that it has been a long time you have been angry about your wife so you think you want to end her life. Is that right or not?
A: Yes.

Q135: What did Leilani do when she saw you bringing the knife?
A: She called out ""Sanaila meu bula"" meaning Sanaila I want to live, ""Daddy meu bula"" meaning Daddy I want to live.

Q136: What did you do to your wife?
A: I want to chop her neck but she put her hands up and the knife landed on her wrist and it fell out.

Q138: How many times did you chop your wife?
A: More than two but about 4 times.
A: I saw her left hand falling off to the river and some deep injuries to her left hand and breast.

Q140: What did you do when your wife was injured?
A I ran away.

16. Now I consider the following aggravating factors.

1. You have attacked the victim who is your de facto wife with hand and made her dizzy and fell in the river.

2. You had knife hidden near the bank of the river and you used the knife to attack the victim.

3. You attacked your unarmed wife with a cane knife several times.

4. You cut the wife's hand and severed the left hand.

5. You cut the right hand and injured it.

6. You cut the breast of the victim.

7. You cut the thighs of the victim.

8. You attacked your wife, when your child who was 4 years old was watching.

9. You kept on attacking the victim when she was crying for help as ""Sanaila meu bula"" meaning Sanaila I want to live, 'Daddy meu bula' meaning daddy I want to live.

10. After the attack you ignored your wife and your child, you ran away when they were in the river.

17. Considering all above aggravating factors, I increase 10 years. Now your sentence is 15 years.

18. Now I consider your mitigating factors.

a) You pleaded guilty at a very early stage of the trial and saved the Court time and resources.

b) You are remorseful.

c) You claim you are suffering from your accident happened in March 2010.

d) You were angry with your wife because she has not properly treated you. 

Considering all above factors, I reduce 4 years from your sentence. Now your sentence is 11 years.

19. Since you are not a first offender, I do not inclined to grant any further deduction to you.

20. I am mindful that you have pleaded at very early occasion. But considering the facts of the case my conscience does not permit me to impose a lenient punishment to you, therefore I fix your sentence at 11 years imprisonment.

21. You have 30 days to appeal.

254970,"JUDGMENT
 
 
1] On the 4th August 2016 the appellant entered a plea of guilty to one offence of grievous harm contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree 2009. He agreed a set of relevant facts and was convicted that same day.
 
 
2] He was sentenced on the 3rd October 2016 to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment with a minimum term to be served of 3 years. 
 
 
3] It is against this sentence that the appellant appeals on the grounds that the Magistrate sentenced him for the wrong offence and that the calculations in the sentence were incorrect.
 
 
4] The victim of this harm was the Appellant’s wife. 
 
5] The facts were that on an evening in July 2016 the then accused (appellant) had used a big stone to hit the lower right leg of his wife several times causing her injury.
 
 
6] Without any evidence of provocation, he proceeded then to hit her right jaw several times with the same big stone and her head. She was in pain and shouted for help but fell into unconsciousness. She regained consciousness when she heard her daughter cry.
 
 
7] In an interview under caution the accused admitted hitting his wife several times on the leg. A medical report found injuries to the leg, the jaw and the head. 
 
 
8] The maximum penalty for this offence under s.258 is 15 years imprisonment. The Magistrate stated in his sentence that the maximum sentence for an offence under s.255 (Act with intent to cause Grievous Harm) is 5 years imprisonment and then went on to discuss authorities pertaining to this latter offence. 
 
 
9] The maximum penalty for a s.255 offence is not 5 years imprisonment but life imprisonment and so very unfortunately the Magistrate was in error both in the offence he was considering and in its maximum penalty.
 
 
10] These errors were compounded when the Magistrate committed a mathematical error in his sentence by taking a starting point of 3 years and adding 2 years for aggravating features to reach 5 years (correct) but then deducting 20 months for the early guilty plea and one year for the mitigation proffered. He arrived at a total of 3 years 8 months which was the sentence he passed when the total should have been 2 years and 8 months.
 
 
11] The Magistrate ordered that the sentence be served “cumulative”
 
 to another sentence he was serving because he had previous convictions for domestic violence. “Cumulative” is not a concept known to Fiji’s sentencing parameters.
 
 
12] In the light of these errors, this Court sets aside the sentence passed below and would sentence afresh pursuant to section 256 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009. 
 
 
 A New Sentence
 
 
13] As stated above the maximum penalty for Grievous Harm under s.258, the offence that the appellant was convicted of below, is 15 years imprisonment. The tariff for the offence is between 2 to 6 years (Felix Patel HAA30.2012 and Pauliasi Yasa (HAC 44.2012).
 
 
14] This was a particularly violent crime with no provocation indicated and having regard to section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I note that it was committed in the presence of a child who was reduced to tears.
 
 
15] For such a crime I take the same starting point as the Magistrate and start my sentence at a term of 3 years imprisonment.
 
 
16] The aggravating features not subsumed in the starting point are the breach of trust between man and wife, the use of a big stone as a weapon and an attack to the head which is inherently dangerous. For these aggravating features I add a further term of 3 years imprisonment. 
 
 
17] His mitigation advanced below was:
 
  
• 40 years old married but separated;
 
• 6 year old daughter;
 
• carpenter earning $320 p.w.;
 
• remorseful and asking victim for forgiveness;
 
• early plea of guilty.
 

18] The appellant has 4 previous convictions in the last 10 years, 3 of which are for assault of the same victim. That record would deny him any mercy from this Court and would allow only his early plea to be recognized as a mitigating factor.
 
 
19] From the interim total of 6 years imprisonment I deduct 2 years for the early plea of guilty.
 
 
20] His oral plea for discount for time spent in remand before trial is invalid. He was serving a 10 month term of imprisonment for having assaulted the same victim.
 
 
21] The sentence I pass is one of 4 years with a minimum to be served before he is eligible for parole to be one of three years. This sentence is to be served concurrently with my other sentence he is serving.
 
 
22] The appellant was made aware at hearing of my powers to increase sentences as well as reduce them.
 
 
23] Section 23(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree does not permit me to backdate this new sentence to 3 October 2016 when he was originally sentenced, and therefore the sentence I pass to commence today is one of 3 years 7 months with the minimum term referred to (supra) of 3 years.
 
 
24] A domestic violence restraining order is now issued to protect the wife with strict no contact provisions and it will remain in force until further order from this Court.

80167,"JUDGMENT

The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following charge in the Suva Magistrate’s Court.

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Cap 17.

Particulars of Offence

MANOJ KUMAR s/o Krishna Goundar on the 14th day of October 2002 at Suva in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely ASHNA NAMRATA SINGH d/o Virendra Singh aged 5 years.

He was sentenced on the 3rd of December 2002 to a 9 month sentence of imprisonment, suspended for 3 years. The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against this sentence on the grounds that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle, and was manifestly lenient.

The charge was laid on the 17th of October 2002. The Respondent pleaded not guilty, and was remanded in custody. On 14th November 2002, he changed his plea to one of guilty. He was represented by counsel. The facts were that on the 14th of October 2002, the victim was 5 years and 7 months old. On that day, she accompanied her uncle to visit neighbours to watch a video. The Respondent who is 30 years old, was also there watching the video and drinking beer. At 11.45pm the victim went outside to urinate. The Respondent followed her and took her into a tool room. He turned off the outside light, made the victim lie down, touched her breasts, pulled off her pants and rubbed his fingers over her vagina. The victim’s father and uncle started to look for her. They checked the tool room and found it locked. They then saw the accused running away from the tool room, and found it locked. They found the victim inside crying. She told her uncle what had happened and the matter was reported to the police. The victim was examined by a doctor, who found a small abrasion on the hymen, with minimal bleeding. The history related to the doctor by the victim was that the Respondent had forced her onto the bed in the tool room, closed her mouth with one hand, pulled her shorts down and took off his own shorts. He then punched her on the stomach, thigh and chest and penetrated her vagina with two fingers. He fondled her private parts, and kissed her.

The Respondent admitted the offence when he was interviewed by the police. He admitted the facts outlined in court. The record shows that he read the medical report, as did counsel.

In mitigation, counsel submitted that he had not intended to commit the offence but had followed her “to check she had completed urination.” She said that he was married with two daughters and expressed remorse. He had one previous conviction in 1991, but was treated as a first offender.

The learned Magistrate then made the following sentencing remarks:

“Accused is a first offender. He has pleaded guilty in the first instance. He appears remorseful. He was remanded in custody pending sentence. His term in remand will have been a lesson to him. He has also assisted the court in pleading guilty in the first instance. Persuasive mitigation by counsel from Legal Aid has assisted the accused. He is severely warned for the offence. In consideration of the principles of sentencing including deterrence, the accused is sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years with effect from today.

Suspended sentence explained.”

In his comprehensive, and well-researched submissions, counsel for the State outlined the principles of sentencing in cases of the sexual assault of children. He argued firstly that section 29(3)(a) of the Penal Code, expressly provided that a sentence must not be suspended in cases of indecency towards children. Secondly he submitted the sentences for indecent assault in Fiji ranged from 1 year to 4 years imprisonment, and that relevant factors determining sentence were the age difference between offender and victim, the penetrative nature of the assault, and any betrayal of trust. He suggested that a 3 year sentence would reflect the nature of the offending in this case.

The Respondent asked for his non-custodial sentence to remain, saying that a custodial sentence will result in hardship for his family.

The suspended sentence

Section 29(3) of the Penal Code provides:

“A court which passes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of not more than six months in respect of one offence shall not make an order under the provisions of subsection (1) where –

(a) the act or any of the acts constituting that offence consisted of an assault on or threat of violence to another person or having or possessing a firearm, an imitation firearm, an explosive or an offensive weapon or of indecent conduct with or towards a person under the age of sixteen years.”

This subsection appears to apply to prevent the suspension of a sentence, where the sentence of imprisonment is for less than 6 months, and the offence committed is one of indecency to children. Fatiaki J in DPP –v- Saviriano Radovu Crim. App. No. HAA0006 of 1996 considered this provision in an appeal by the State against a suspended sentence imposed for the indecent assault of an 8 year old child. In that case the sentence imposed was 9 years imprisonment suspended for 18 months and a fine of $30.00. His Lordship held that whilst it appeared that the limitation to section 29 applied only to sentences below 6 months imprisonment:

“I cannot accept that in expressly excluding such acts from the operation of subsection (1) of section 29, the legislature was concerned only with the length of sentence imposed and not with the nature or type of offence committed. Quite plainly it was. If this were not so, one would have the rather extraordinary situation where serious offending such as Attempted Armed Robbery, where a prison sentence under 2 years was imposed could technically be suspended, whereas a misdemeanour of Being in Possession of an Offensive Weapon in a Public Place could not be suspended if the trial magistrate imposed a sentence of less than 6 months.”

Further, at page 7, he pointed out that the entire purpose of the limitations imposed by section 29(3)(a) could be circumvented by imposing a sentence longer than 6 months in order to suspend it. He held that the whole of section 29 must be read together and that a court was therefore prevented from suspending the sentence of any offender convicted of the offences set out therein, irrespective of the length of the sentence.

On a careful reading of section 29(1)(a) of the Code, the reference to sentences of less than 6 months imprisonment is difficult to understand. Further, whilst section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (U.K.) had a similar provision, (although as Fatiaki J said in Saviriano Radovu (supra), with quite a different effect) its successor, the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 (U.K.) has no such limitation. Further section 118 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides as follows:

“(4) A court shall not deal with an offender by means of a suspended sentence unless it is of the opinion –

(a) that the case is one in which a sentence of imprisonment would have been appropriate even without the power to suspend the sentence; and

(b) that the exercise of that power can be justified by the exceptional circumstances of the case.”

The courts have interpreted the phrase “exceptional circumstances” strictly (R –v- Robinson 14 Cr. App. R(s) 559, A-G’s Reference (No. 5 of 993) (R –v- Hartland 15 Cr. App. R(s) 201) and there can be no doubt that the general limitation of the statutory availability of the suspended sentence, originated from public dissatisfaction with perceived over-use of the suspended sentence.

With respect, such a general limitation on section 29 of the Penal Code, would be far more useful, then the ambiguous and anomalous provisions of section 29(3)(a).

For the purposes of this appeal, I find that the purpose of the sub-section is to limit the use of suspended sentences in cases of, inter alia, offences of indecency against children, and that to that extent the suspended sentence imposed in this case, although it exceeded 6 months in length, offended that purpose.

Sentencing principles generally

Even, in the absence of section 29(3)(a) however, the sentence was wrong in principle. There are now many decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal which have allowed for the setting of a tariff for indecent assault cases. Sentences range from 1 year to 4 years, and where the victim is a child, the starting point is 3 years imprisonment. I upheld that starting point in Apisai Bavadra –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0006 of 2003S. In that case a 45 year old man rubbed his fingers over the vagina of a 9 year old child. A sentence of 2 years imprisonment was imposed and upheld. In Robin Abhinesh Lal –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0029 of 1998, Surman J upheld a sentence of 18 months imprisonment imposed for the rubbing of the victim’s vagina with the offender’s penis. The victim was 3 years old, the offender was 18.

In Mark Mutch –v- State Crim. App. No. AAU0060.1999, sentences of 4 years imprisonment each on separate counts of indecent assault which involved the fondling of breasts and the inserting of fingers into the vagina of the victims, were upheld by the Court of Appeal. As I said in Ratu Penioni Rakota –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0068 of 2002, aggravating factors in the indecent assault of children include the nature of the assault, whether violence was used, whether weapons were used, the length of time over which the assaults took place, the betrayal of the child’s trust in a family member or friend, and a large disparity in age between victim and offender. Mitigating factors include a plea of guilty, previous good character and remorse.

In this case, the Respondent was rightly treated as a first offender, and credit was given for the guilty plea. However, the aggravating circumstances were the assaults on the victim, the penetration of her vagina with two fingers and the age of the child compared with the age of the Respondent. With a starting point of 3 years imprisonment, reduction for the mitigation, and an increase for the aggravating factors, I arrive at a sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

The suspended sentence was therefore wrong in principle and manifestly lenient.

Conclusion

This appeal is allowed. The Respondent is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to commence today.

70320,"SENTENCE

1. The accused stood charged for having committed the offence of rape on one BX on 13 June 2010. After the trial that lasted for three days, the assessors returned unanimous opinions of guilty against the accused. I, having considered the evidence and my summing up on law, concurred with the opinions of the assessors and convicted the accused of the offence as charged under Section 207 (2) (c) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

2. The charge was sequel to an act of penetration of the mouth of BX with the penis of the accused. The accused, who stays at home during daytime because of his security duty at night, was fifty years of age.

3. The victim, on the other hand, was only four years, who had suffered a great loss with the untimely death of her father when she was only three months old. And, she became destitute as her mother, too, left her after some time from the death of the father. Since then, the victim was under the care of her grandmother.

4. The victim along with her grandmother came to reside in a village about a year back where the accused was only couple of doors away. The victim with the other children of the neighbourhood used to play at the place of the accused and got familiar with him and his place of residence. This familiarity could be seen as the victim, admittedly, called the accused Babban Dada or grandfather.

5. On 13 June 2010, the grandmother sent the victim to the accused's place to bring back her shoes, which was found lying at the rear of the house and waited for her return under a tree in her premises. The victim, after a while, came to the grandmother and said that the accused did 'something'. Upon enquiry, the victim revealed that the accused undressed himself and removed her pyjama down, rubbed his penis around her genitalia and put his penis into her mouth. After the accused took his penis out, she saw the accused 'piss[ing]' on the bed meaning that the accused had ejaculated. She saw the accused wiping out the substance which looked 'white' in colour with a piece of cloth. The accused thereafter told the victim not to reveal the incident to anyone.

6. It is on the above facts that the accused stands convicted under Section 207 (2) (c) of the Crimes Decree 2009, which expanded the traditional scope of the offence of rape to include inter alia the instances of penetration of the mouth of a victim without the consent. In this case, as provided for under Section 207 (3) of the Decree and, as admitted by the accused, consent became immaterial as the victim-BX was only four years of age and incapable of giving consent. 

7. The offence of rape is very serious in that it is triable only by the High Court, which attracts the punishment of life imprisonment under Section 207 (1) of the Decree. In addition to the severity that could be gauged with reference to the sentence, sexual offences by their very constitution are serious in nature because law recognises no exculpatory or mitigatory defences. Courts, time and again, have emphasized the requirement of deterrence in imposing sentences on convicts for rape of children. 

8. Accordingly, the range of sentence for rape of children has been set between 10-15 years by sentencing guidelines. Madigan J. commenced his starting point of sentence at 12 years to punish a rape convict where the victim was a fourteen year old step-daughter and imposed a term of 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years (State v Mario Tauvoli; HAC 027/2011).

9. Justice Priyantha Fernando in State v Anand Abhay Raj (HAC 09/2010) applied a similar range of sentence to deal with an offender who had raped a ten year old step daughter-and picked-up 12 years as the starting point to reach a sentence of 16 years with. Justice Fernando, who imposed a mandatory 12 year period of sentence in that case, lent strength to the words of Goundar J. in State v AV (2009) FJHC 24 concerning the offence of rape of children, where it was held: 

Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault... Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children...sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences

10. Learned counsel for the State and for the accused accepted the above range of sentence for the rape of children. They also addressed court on aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to assist court in regard to the imposition of an appropriate sentence on the accused. I have considered their submissions very carefully in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree in determining the sentence.

11. The victim in this case was only four years of age at the time of the incident. She was just stepping into her formative ages and moving around playing. The accused, who was fifty, had three grown up children, two of them were married. The accused had four grandchildren from the two married daughters out of whom two were in or about the same age as that of the victim. There cannot be any doubt that the accused, in the circumstances, knew the value of children and that they needed protection and shelter from adults. Despite that the accused raped the little girl, who was in the age group of his grandchildren to satisfy his unnatural lust.

12. The accused's engagement in the unilateral acts of sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. The accused, nevertheless, continued with the same, as evidence unravelled, until he reached the climax of ejaculation. His moral culpability was manifested when he told the victim not to tell the incident with a view to conceal his dastardly act from the whole world and escape the long arm of the law.

13. These kinds of immoral acts on a little girl in the calibre of BX are bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and assess. This kind of depravity should be frowned upon to save little children for their own future; and, men of the accused's calibre should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in a case of this nature, deterrence is, therefore, of paramount importance.

14. I am, in the circumstances, inclined to pick up a starting point of 14 years for the sentence in this case to reflect that the victim is very small compared to those in the two cases referred to above. I add four years for the considerations in paragraphs 10 and 11 above, which I consider as seriously aggravating circumstances to enhance the sentence to reach 18 years.

15. I do not see favourable circumstances to mitigate the sentence apart from the fact that the accused is a first offender. Although, the offence for which he is convicted now, is so serious that his previous good behaviour should not have earned him a discount, I nevertheless decide to reduce his sentence by 15 months. The accused had been on remand nearly for nine months, which should be deducted from his sentence. I, in the result, arrive at a term of 16 year-imprisonment. 

16. The accused has not shown any remorse or repentance. On the contrary, he relentlessly castigated the grandmother saying that she was making up a false allegation at the expense of the little girl to get rid of him of his land without any evidence to found such a serious allegation. This added, in my view, insult to the injury. While the court recognises that the accused was entitled to advance any proposition to advance his case, court equally recognises that it should show its displeasure by showing no mercy in the matter of sentence when such allegations are found to be totally ill-founded as in this case. The accused, in his mitigation, also did not rely on any other circumstance that led him to this unnatural lust. 

17. Accordingly, I will determine that a 16 year period of imprisonment on the accused is appropriate to meet the principles and objectives of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. The final sentence, therefore, is 16 years of imprisonment.

18. Acting under Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I order that the accused shall not be eligible for parole until he serves 14 years in imprisonment.

79082,"JUDGMENT

Background

[1] Following a trial in Suva Magistrates’ Court, the appellant was convicted for rape and was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment. He appeals against conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal, in summary, allege the following errors:

• Failure to direct on standard of proof.
• Conviction not supported by evidence.
• Lack of resistance.
• Lack of corroboration.
• Sentence is unlawful and wrong in principle.

Facts

[2] The complainant is a young woman in her early twenties. She grew up in the same village as the appellant. She has known the appellant from a young age. The complainant was in a relationship with the appellant’s nephew (Lasike), who also resided in the same village. Lasike’s home was a few meters away from the appellant’s house. 

[3] On 2 June 2006, Lasike and the complainant attended a fundraising together at a home in the village. Later in the night, they walked to the roadside. The complainant was drunk. Lasike left the complainant at the roadside and went to buy a cigarette from a shop. The complainant said that while she was waiting at the roadside for her boyfriend to return from the shop, she was forcefully taken underneath a nearby house by one Jo Waisuku and raped. 

[4] When Lasike returned, he saw the complainant crying. Lasike took the complainant to the appellant’s house but it was closed. Lasike knew the appellant and his wife were attending a function at his home. He went home, got the key to the house from the appellant’s wife, and returned to the complainant. Lasike took the complainant inside the appellant’s house, and after a conversation left her there, and returned home to check if the function at his home was over. Lasike said the complainant closed the door when he left but he does not know whether the complainant locked it. After 10 minutes, Lasike returned and found the complainant outside and the appellant and his wife inside their house. Lasike noticed injury on the complainant’s face. He took the complainant to her home and left her there.

[5] The complainant said she was raped by the appellant when she was lying down inside the appellant’s bedroom after her boyfriend had left. She said the appellant pulled her down from the bed on to the floor and had sexual intercourse with her. She resisted but the appellant covered her mouth. While the appellant was having sex, his wife walked in and punched the complainant. Under cross examination the complainant said she recognized the appellant because she had seen him many times in the village. She said although there was no light inside the bedroom, she recognized the appellant’s face and when his wife walked in, she turned on the light and punched her when she saw the appellant on top of her. 

[6] The appellant’s caution interview was tendered without any objection. The appellant said that when he and his wife returned to their home, he saw the complainant lying in his bedroom. He said he tried to wake her up and tell her to go home. He denied raping her.

[7] The appellant’s sworn evidence was consistent with his caution statements. The appellant’s wife gave evidence confirming the account given by him.

Consideration of Appeal Grounds

[8] The case against the appellant substantially depended on the complainant’s evidence. There was evidence that the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant and without her consent. The learned Magistrate directed herself that the prosecution carried the burden of proving the charge beyond reasonable doubt. 

[9] When considering the complainant’s evidence the learned Magistrate directed her mind to the question of corroboration of her evidence. Being satisfied that the complainant was a reliable witness, the learned Magistrate found there was no need for corroboration. The learned Magistrate accepted the complainant as a truthful witness after warning herself about the requirement of corroboration in sexual cases. 

[10] The learned Magistrate dealt with the appellant and his wife’s evidence and disbelieved them. The learned Magistrate said:

""Iowane Sireli and his wife Unaisi Leweniqila, according to their evidence entered the house together. It’s a one bedroom house. According to the evidence Iowane Sireli went to wake Nina whilst Unaisi went to warm up the food. It appears strange that Unaisi did not show any curiosity as to who was lying on her bed and just continued with the warming of the food. Their evidence sounded very doubtful.""

[11] The appellant contends that he cannot be convicted for rape unless corroboration is present. There is no basis for the contention. There is no statutory requirement for corroboration in cases of sexual offences. The rule of practice that required a warning that it was dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant was reviewed by the Court of Appeal in the case of Seremaia Balelala v The State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0003 of 2004S. The court declared that the rule of practice should only be applied if there was some particular aspect of the complainant’s evidence that gave rise to a question as to its reliability. 

[12] Although the appellant challenged the complainant’s identification of him, the identification by the complainant was not a case of a fleeting glance. The appellant was not a total stranger to the complainant. She saw his face while he was on top of her, which identification was later confirmed when the appellant’s wife turned on the light and punched the complainant when she saw the appellant and the complainant together. The evidence of the appellant’s wife did not support the complainant’s evidence, but his. The issue then was whether the appellant and his wife were telling the truth, or whether the complainant was telling the truth. 

[13] In this case there was no corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and as I have said the law did not require corroboration. The learned Magistrate convicted the appellant after being satisfied that the complainant was a truthful witness. I cannot see any error in the manner in which the learned Magistrate assessed the complainant’s credibility and her evidence. The learned Magistrate convicted the appellant after being satisfied of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

[14] In her sentencing remarks the learned Magistrate said this must have been a horrific experience for the complainant. First she was raped by a fellow village man and then when she took shelter at the appellant’s home she was raped by the appellant who also was a fellow village man. The learned Magistrate considered the fact that the complainant grew in the same village and that the appellant knew her and had seen her growing up as an aggravating factor. The mitigating factors were the appellant’s previous good character and family circumstances. The learned Magistrate used a term of 7 years as a starting point. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, she imposed a term of 6 years imprisonment. The sentence is neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive. 

Result

[15] In the result all the appellant’s grounds of appeal are rejected and the appeal is dismissed.

[16] The conviction and sentence are confirmed.

79717,"SENTENCE

1. You, Iowane Valeuto, are here, to be sentenced on admission of guilt on your own accord for the following offence namely: 

Indecently Assault: Contrary to Section 154[1] [c] of the Penal Code.

There are two counts in this regard.

I am satisfied with your plea is unequivocal and that you understand the repercussion of your plea. I am further satisfied the facts of this case present, included and proved every elements of this offence. 

2. According to the facts, (which you have admitted), between 1st March 2007 t0 31st March 2007, you indecently assaulted Sokoveti Vaubula. There were two incidents. The first one was while 11 year old child victim was sleeping with her mother at that night, you tried to pull down her pants, and thereafter she kicked your head and managed to escape. Second incident was the serious incident. The victim was alone with you and you forcefully undressed her. Victim was frightened and shivering. Then you began to lick her vagina and sucked her nipples. Then you took off your pants and put your penis on her vagina. Then you proceeded to slide your penis over victim's vagina whilst sucking her nipples. You did this few minutes and left the victim. 

3. Maximum penalty could be imposed for this offence is 5 year imprisonment.

4. Tariffs vary the gravity and nature of these offences. In RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S Shameem J held that ""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence.""...A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type""

Aggravating Factors of the offence

5. Following facts were revealed by the summary of facts placed before the court and will be considered as aggravating factors.

- Serious breach of trust
-act against the societal, religious and traditional rules
- took deliberate advantage of the victim's naivety and trust
-lack of responsibility
-age gap with the victim, the accused was 37 years and victim was 11 years

Mitigating Factors 

6- You are a first offender and have previous good character. You said you are 38 years, married with 3 children, Security guard by profession. You earn 1$30 per week. You said still you are a first offender and asked court's forgiveness and leniency in this case. You ask non custodial sentence. You said you are the sole bread winner of the family and ask second chance. You said you are not living with the complainant and reconciled with complainant. It is to be noted this is not a reconcilable charge. But, I note the victim has written two letters to the DPP and to the court stating that she desired to withdraw her complaint against the accused Iowane Valueuto. This case has not decided on merits. In that scenario the accused wished to plead guilty and asked non custodial sentence. It is sure the accused act is against the society and it cannot be withdrawn by the victim. It is not clear why the DPP had not taken the victim's request as they normally act in other requests, similar types of cases, probably the gravity of the offence. At the time of taking plea the Counsel for the DPP was present, but has not shown that they seek deterrent sentence in this matter, but they filed sentencing submission indicating that they insist deterrent sentence. It seems to me that State is expecting deterrent sentencing according to guideline judgements as they rely on. This court admits that the behaviour of the accused cannot be condoned whatsoever. But victim has chosen to withdraw her complaint. If victim refused to give evidence in the trial what would be the outcome of this case. Off course she is a compellable witness but if she refused or lied to court what would be the situation. This case is hanging over since 2007. In the light of these circumstances this court accepted the plea of guilty of the accused and indicated that non custodial sentence could be given if he pleads. It is to be noted that plea bargaining by the court is permitted although sentence bargaining is not permitted by the parties in commonwealth and common law jurisdictions. The trial judge has sole discretions to pass the sentence under attended circumstances. (See Attorney General v J.S. Uluwaduge [1995] 1 Sri Lanka Law Reports 157 per Justice D.P.S. Gunesekera). In Similar Jurisdiction in Attorney General v Mendis [1995] 1 Sri Lanka Law Reports 138,Justice Gunesekera articulated, in sentencing,""the trial judge should not surrender his sacred right and duty to any other"". These principles and guidelines are persuasive to me. 

7. I select 2 years as the starting point. You pleaded guilty for the charge without going to the trial. Therefore, you are entitled for reduction of your sentence. Normally, exercising court's discretion, superior courts have followed 1/3 reduction for early plea. (as set out in Veretariki Vetaukula vs The State, High Court Crim App Case No: HAA057/07, followed in Hem Dutt vs The State, FCA Crim App Case No: AAU 0066 of 2005 and Aliki Vilimoni vs State, FJHC 12; HAA 131-132, 2007. ),. I reduce 6 months and sentence is 1 year 6 months. For aggravating fact I increase 1 year and your sentence is now 2 years and 6 months. You saved court's time and resources. Despite Pw1 has withdrawn the complainant two times you opted to plead guilty to the charge. Therefore I reduce 6 months. Your actual sentence is 2 years imprisonments. 

8. In this scenario, as court indicated, should I impose you a custodial sentence in this case? Or Should I suspend it? I note that you are a first offender. I consider decided cases in this regard. 

9. In Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132; Haa0032j.94s (30 September19994) S W Kepa J enunciated that the fact that Appellants are first offenders ought to be a very strong mitigating factor in their favour. A prison sentence ought to be the last resort after the court has explored and exhausted all other alternative sentences. (Emphasize is mine)

10. In Prasad v State [1994] FJCA 19; Aau0023u.93s (24 May 1994), Fiji Court of Appeal held that "".... Courts ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders.""

11. It has been noted in Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132 (Supra) that criminologists recognise that a prison sentence should be the last resort especially where a first offender is concerned unless the charge is very serious or the offender is dangerous and imprisonment is called for in the public interest or in the interest of the offender himself. (Emphasize is mine).

12. Singh v The State [2000] FJHC 115; Haa0079j.2000s (26 October 2000) Shameem J went on saying;

""However as a general rule, leniency is shown to first offenders, young offenders, and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse. I believe that in this case, every effort should have been made to keep four of the Appellants out of prison. They were first offenders, they were only 18 years old, and they pleaded guilty on being brought to court. Although the 1st Appellant was not 18 years old, he was a first offender and this offence was clearly an aberration during what appears to be an otherwise blameless life.""

13. Nariva v The State [2006] FJHC 6; HAA0148J.2005S (9 February 2006) Shammem J again stressed; 

""The courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment.""

14. You are not young, but have a large family. You are a first offender. If you sentenced to prison term your family will be punished indirectly. Actually this is hard case to sentence. You should be shamed and your act can not be compromised whatsoever. In this legal backdrop, summary of facts and your mitigation and the nature of offence, I opt to give a suspended sentence. Your two years sentence is suspended for 5 years. In addition you pay $ 250 as compensation to the victim. You are given 3 months to pay this compensation.

15. You, Iowane Valeuto, are sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Sentence is suspended for 5 years. In addition you pay $250 as compensation, in default 25 days in imprisonment. 

16. Nature of suspended sentence is explained and copy of this sentence is given to the accused. 

17. 28 days to appeal.

79439,"SENTENCE

[1] Isei Korodrau has been found guilty after trial and convicted for one count of Rape contrary to Section 207(1)(2)(a) of Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

[2] The victim, an employee of Home of Compassion, left for work in the early hours on 20/02/2011. The accused waylaid dragged her to a ditch in a slope and committed rape. He mercilessly punched her face several times before he had sex with her forcibly. The victim vividly explained to court how she was raped after she was dragged to a slope. 

[3] Accused denied the charge.

[4] As per Section 207 of Crimes Decree 2009 any rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Tariffs for Rape

[5] In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:

""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point."" 

[6] In endorsing the Kasim case cited above, the Court of Appeal in Asaeli Drotini No: 1 of 2005 stated:

[15] ""The continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in the levels of sentences ordered in rape cases by the courts in Fiji. We endorse that trend. We do not suggest that the starting point described in Mohammed Kasim's case should be altered in rape cases in general but the sentencing court should not hesitate to increase the sentence substantially where there are further aggravating factors.""

[7] In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008) the court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & Others HAC 0008 of 1996 and the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

[8] The accused is 23 years of age. He lives with his parents and helps the family in subsistence and commercial farming of dalo and yaqona. He sells root crops to generate income to buy family needs. 

[9] In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person

[10] I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

[11] Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

[12] The objectives of sentencing, as found in Section 4(1) of the Decree, are 
as follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;
	2.	To protect the community from offenders;
	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or 
	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

[13] Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;

(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;

(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;

(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

[14] Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The accused had assaulted the victim causing injuries on her 
body.
	1.	Victim was kept under his custody for about 30 minutes.
	2.	The victim suffered physical and mental trauma.
	3.	The accused while choosing to go for trial put the victim through the trauma of having to relive the incident. 
	4.	The accused showed total disregard to the victim's right to a peaceful life by committing this offence.
	5.	The accused has 5 previous convictions.

[15] Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

	1.	Accused is 23 years old.
	2.	He helps his parents in subsistence and commercial farming.
	3.	He has been in remand for more than 2 years.

[16] Considering all aggravating and mitigating circumstances I take 07 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add 03 years for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 10 years. I deduct 02 years for the mitigating factors.

[17] In summary you are sentenced to 08 years imprisonment.

[18] The accused was born on 26/06/1991. He was 19 years and 07 months old at the time of offending. He committed the offence just entering his adulthood. Further he has been in remand for more than two years. Considering Sections 18(1) and 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 06 years as non-parole period.

[19] 30 days to appeal.

250491,"JUDGMENT
 
  
• Appellant was charged with following offences : - Burglary contrary to Section 312 (1) of the Crimes Decree, 2009; Indecent Assault contrary to Section 212 (1) of the Crimes Decree, 2009 and Escaping from Lawful Custody contrary to Section 196 of the Crimes Decree.
 
 
• Appellant pleaded guilty to the above charges on the 19th September 2016 when his plea was taken at the Lautoka Magistrates Court.
 
 
• The Appellant was convicted accordingly of the above charges and was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for the offence of Burglary and 9 months imprisonment for Indecent Assault. Both sentences were to run concurrently.
 
 
• However, for the offence of Escaping from Lawful Custody, the Court sentenced the Appellant to 9 months imprisonment and the Court decided that this sentence be served consecutively.
 
 
• Being dissatisfied with the decision of the Magistrates Court, the Appellant filed his amended grounds of appeal against sentence within time.
 

Grounds of Appeal
 
  
• In summary, the Appellant’s grounds of appeal filed are as follows:
 

(i) That the learned sentencing Magistrate erred in law in acting upon the wrong principle of sentencing.
 
 
(ii) That the learned sentencing Magistrate erred in law by allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide him.
 
 
 (iii) That the learned sentencing Magistrate had mistook the facts.
 
 
 (iv) That the learned sentencing Magistrate failed to take into account some relevant considerations.
 
 
 In support of these grounds the Appellant filed handwritten submissions. The Respondent also filed submissions in reply. The principal ground of appeal relates to the issue of sentencing in the Magistracy.
 
 
Facts admitted by the Appellant
  
• Accused and complainant were neighbors. Complainant was living with her husband and children. 
 
 
• On the day of incidence, complainant was sleeping inside her house with her two daughters in the living room and her husband was sleeping in the bedroom with the 3 year old son. The door was locked. Accused somehow managed to open the door and entered the house of complainant. As Accused entered the house, the house was in dark so he used his gas lighter to see where complainant was sleeping.
 
 
• Accused saw complainant sleeping with her two daughters on the mattress on the floor then he sat beside complainant and slipped his hand inside complainant’s under garment and started fondling with her vagina. Complainant woke up and was unable to see the face of accused because there was no light in the house. She thought it was her husband and started calling her husband’s name. Accused replied that “it is me Paula”. Hearing this complainant screamed and from this her husband woke up. When complainant’s husband entered the living room he saw someone stepping outside the front door. Complainant’s husband picked a stick and threw it and it hit accused’s left ear. Whilst accused was running away, from the light of house, complainant’s husband clearly recognized accused.
 

Law Relating to Appeals against Sentence
 
  
• The sentencing Court should be guided by the proportionality principle enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 and guideline judgments, if any, in arriving at an appropriate sentence. 
 
 
• Section 11 (1) of the Constitution provides:
 

“Every person has the right to freedom from torture of any kind, whether physical, mental or emotional, and from cruel, inhumane, degrading or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment” 
 
  
• Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states:
 

“As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part”.
 
  
• An examination of Fiji case law reveals that proportionality is the most fundamental principle of sentencing so far developed by the courts. This principle seems not only to be a rule of law but also a constitutional imperative. The selection of the particular punishment to be imposed on an individual offender is subject to the constitutional principle of proportionality. A constitutional protection to exist in determining that the punishment must first be proportionate to the offence but also proportionate to the personal circumstances of the offender. In essence, this principle demands that a sentencing court should first locate the specific offence on the overall scale of gravity and then proceed to make any necessary allowance for relevant personal circumstances. It is within this cardinal principle that criminal record must be assessed in affecting the quantum of punishment to be imposed on the offender.
 
 
• This Court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2].  
 
 
• In Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999) the Fiji Appeal Court observed:
 

“It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499)”.
 
  
• The Supreme Court, in Naisua v State [2013] FJSC 14; CAV0010.2013 (20 November 2013), endorsed the views expressed in Bae (supra):
 

“It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
 
 (i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
(iii) Mistook the facts;
 
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration. 
 
  
• The Fiji Court of Appeal in Sharma v State [unreported Cr. App. No. AAU0065 of 2012; 2 June 2014] discussed approach to be taken when reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court. The Court observed: 
 

“In determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this Court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge. The approach taken by this Court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or, in other words, that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range. It follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the Court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range. However, it must be recalled that the test is not whether the Judges of this Court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence. It must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust”
 
  
• Having considered the aforementioned case law and sentencing principles, I proceed to review the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate to see if it is harsh or excessive. 

Analysis
 
  
• Grounds raised by the Appellant are based on the premise that the sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principle. Therefore, all the grounds can to be dealt with together.
 
 
• Learned sentencing Magistrate at paragraph 9 of his Ruling had correctly identified the maximum penalty for each offence. According to Section 312 [1] of the Crimes Decree, maximum sentence for Burglary is 13 years’ imprisonment. Maximum Sentence for the offence of Indecent Assault is 5 years’ imprisonment [S 212 (1)] and for the offence of Escaping from Lawful Custody, the maximum sentence is 2 years’ imprisonment [S.196]. 
 
 
• Learned Magistrate took the tariff for Burglary as between 18 months and four years’ imprisonment. In identifying the tariff for Burglary, the learned Magistrate considered Petero Baleiwaiyevo v The State [2008] HAM 002/08, a house breaking case decided under the repealed Penal Code. At that time, the maximum sentence for Burglary was imprisonment for life and the tariff ranged from 18 months to 4 years. After promulgation of the Crimes Decree, the maximum sentence was reduced to 13 years’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• After analyzing series of authorities, Rajasinghe J in Vuli v State [2017] FJHC 17; HAA 53.2016 [23 January 2017] concluded that the tariff for Burglary under Crimes Decree should be between 1 and 3 year’s imprisonment.
 
 
• Therefore, learned sentencing Magistrate fell into error when he considered Petero Baleiwaiyevo v The State [2008] HAM 002/08, a house breaking case decided under the repealed Penal Code to identify the tariff for Burglary.
 
 
• As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. 
 
 
• In Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15: AAU 0018.2010 [5th March 2013] the Court of Appeal observed the following in respect of the starting point:
 

“In selecting a starting point, the Court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing Court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.”
 
  
• Learned Magistrate picked a starting point of 20 months for the first count of Burglary from the upper range of tariff and did not take into account the good practice advocated in Karoivuki (supra). He also failed to give any reason for selecting a higher starting point. 
 
 
• Learned Magistrate correctly identified the tariff for Indecent Assault as between 12 months and 4 years. 
 
 
• Tariff for Indecent Assault was set out in Rakota v State [2002] FJHC 168; HAA0068J.2002S (23 August 2002). Shameem J observed:
 

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.
 
 
These are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff, although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate. A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.
 
  
• The starting point selected for Indecent Assault was 12 months, from the lower range of tariff and the final sentence (9 months’ imprisonment) fell within the tariff in conformity with Karoivuki (supra) principle. 
 
 
• There is no tariff set for Escaping from Lawful Custody. Nine months’ imprisonment imposed on this count is not excessive. 
 
 
• Having selected the starting point for each count learned Magistrate went on to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances. However, he took elements of offences when he stated: “The aggravating factors are that for the unlawfully entered the complainant’s house and disturbed the complainant from her sleep and created a perception of insecurity in the village”. He could better have taken night time invasion as an aggravating factor. 
 
 
• Having adjusted the sentence for aggravating and mitigating factors learned Magistrate imposed a final sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment for Burglary count which fell within tariff. Final sentences imposed on Indecent Assault count and Escaping from Lawful Custody count were also within permissible range. Therefore, when taken individually, sentence imposed on each count is neither hash nor excessive.
 
 
• The Appellant raised the issue in his submission that his sentence was harsh and excessive when it was made to run consecutively to the existing prison term.
 
 
• However, as per the Court Record no prison term was being served by the Appellant at the time his sentence although he had pleaded guilty to the count of Escaping from Lawful Custody on an earlier occasion. Therefore, Appellant was not a serving prisoner at the time of his sentence. 
 
 
• Learned Magistrate at paragraph 19 of his sentence remarked “Paula Bete, I have decided to have both sentence(s) to be served consecutively and therefore you are sentence(d) to 25 months imprisonment”. It appears that learned Magistrate was dealing with two distinct cases namely CF 656/16 and CF 424/16 when he ordered the sentence imposed on Escaping from Lawful Custody (9 months) in CF 424/16 to be served consecutive to sentence imposed in CF 656/19 (16 months) 
 
 
• Section 22, of the Sentencing and Penalties Act allows the Court to order sentence to run consecutively or concurrently. Section provides as follows:
 

 (1) Subject to sub-section (2), every term of imprisonment imposed on a person by a court must, unless otherwise directed by the court, be served concurrently with any uncompleted sentence or sentences of imprisonment.
 
 
(2) Sub-section (1) does not apply to a term of imprisonment imposed—
 
 
(a) in default of payment of a fine or sum of money;
 
 
(b) on a prisoner in respect of a prison offence or as a result of an escape from custody;
 
 
(c) on a habitual offender under Part III;
 
 
(d) on any person for an offence committed while released on parole; or
 
 
(e) on any person for an offence committed while released on bail in relation to another offence.
 
 
(3) ...................
 
 
(4) Every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of a prison offence or an escape offence must, unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances, be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment.
 
 
(5) Every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of an offence committed while released on parole in relation to another sentence of imprisonment imposed on that person must, unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances, be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment which the offender may be required to serve in custody on cancellation of the parole order.
 
(6) Every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of an offence committed while released on bail in relation to any other offence must, unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances, be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment.
 
  
• This provision was discussed by the Fiji Court of Appeal in Vukitoga v State [2013] FJCA 19; AAU0049.2008 (13 March 2013) which was referred to in Dhirendra Nandan v State – HAM 162 of 2014. The Court held that a concurrent sentence should be imposed and that if the court intends to impose a consecutive sentence, then the court must give a justifiable reason to do so. In this case, the learned Magistrate imposed a consecutive sentence without giving any reason. Therefore, the Respondent concedes Appellant’s argument to be meritorious.
 
 
• In view of section 22(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, the learned Magistrate would have been correct in ordering consecutive sentence even without giving any reason if the Appellant was a serving prisoner having an uncompleted prison term at the time of sentence. Since the Appellant was not serving at that time, learned Magistrate was required to give reasons for ordering a consecutive sentence instead of a concurrent sentence.
 
 
• Hence, Section 256 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act warrants me to exercise powers to quash the order made by the learned Magistrate at paragraph 19 of his sentence Ruling that required Appellant to serve 9 months’ consecutive to 16 months’ imprisonment imposed in CF 656/16. Accordingly I quash the sentence of 25 months imprisonment and substitute a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment. 
 
• The Appellant was involved in a night time invasion and the assault was not of fleeting type. Therefore, I do not order a suspended sentence. 
 

Final Order
 
  
• Sentence for Burglary Count is 16 months’ imprisonment.

 Sentence for Indecent Assault count is 9 months’ imprisonment.
 
 Sentence for Escaping from Lawful Custody count is 9 months imprisonment.
 
 All sentences to be served concurrently.
 
 
 
Accordingly, The Appellant is sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment from the date of his original sentence (3rd October, 2016). The Registry is directed to issue a fresh committal warrant to the Correction Service forthwith.

247181,"SENTENCE
 
You “Ram Khelawan” are here today, to be sentenced on admission of guilty on your own accord for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
According to the summary of facts tendered by the Prosecution which you admitted in open court, were as follows:-
 
 “On the 7th day of February 2015 at about 2100 hours at Kabisi, Sigatoka one Prasil Pratik Kumar (A-1) 28 years businessman of Waiyavi Stage 1 Lautoka was assaulted by one Ram Khelawan (Accused) 55 years casual worker of Kabisi, Sigatoka.

On the abovementioned time and place (A-1) came to celebrate her daughter’s birthday at accused residence’s which is (A-1)’s father in law. (A-1)’s daughter was playing when he heard his wife namely Pritika swore at her daughter. (A-1) then warned his wife not to do that again. Accused then intervened leading him punching (A-1). (A-1) got injured as per medical report.
 
Later accused was arrested interview under caution and charged for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm”
 
According to the section 275 of the Crime Decree of 2009, the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is the summary offence and maximum sentence could be imposed against you for such offence is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm range from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault. (Gounder J in JonetaniSereka v The State 2008,FJHC 88, HAA027,2008), (State v Anjula Devi, Crim Case No 04 of 1998).
 
Accordingly, I convicted you as charged and I select 6 months’ imprisonment as a starting point.
 
Aggravating Factors
 
According to the information revealed by the summary of facts placed before this court, that as a result of the assaulted, the victim sustained injuries as per medical report tendered in court; i.e. “bruises(1x1cm), (x2) on left arm medial surface, tender over left arm and tender nasal area”.
 
Considering the aggravating factor, I increase further 4 months of imprisonment from the starting point. Now, your sentence stands for 10 months imprisonment.
 
You are a first offender, therefore you’re entitle to a 1/3 discount; and you pleaded guilty at the early possible instance thus saving the court and prosecution time and expenses. I deduct 2 months from your early guilty plea; and 2 months deducted for the being a first offender, thus living the total sentence to 6 months imprisonment.
 
Mitigating Factors
 
In mitigating your LAC Counsel told the court as follows:-
 
 54 years old;
 Married and retired farmer and only doing farming now for a subsistence purpose;
 Sole bread winner of the family;
 Victim is son in law and that day the victim assaulted the accused daughter being victims wife; in front of the accused and you got upset and assaulted the victim;
 Receiving Social Welfare Assistance allowance at $50.00 per month;
 Recently, like 3 weeks ago, being attested with mile-stroke and accused was limping when came to court today, still recovering slowly;

My side comments:-[no medical evidence/report, tendered to confirm the evidence given by LAC counsel-with due respect, from the bar table in court, it is not a recommended practice, I would say...]strong evidence are the once strongly supported with concrete and tangible documentary/physical evidence...that’s what this court need and officers of the court are the ones’ to be always on the front line to assist the court in anyway and every way, they can in Maintaining & Sustaining the Equal Standard of our local Justice System...”
 
[emphasis originally mine]
 
And lastly seek forgiveness of the court.
 
I further deduct another 3 months for the mitigating factors above, which now leaves your total sentence to three (3) months’ imprisonment.
 
 After considering all the above, your personal circumstances, being first and ranged age offender, mature enough to control your temper, but it had overruled you on the day in question.
 
And the fact that accused had shown remorse to court in pleading guilty at the earliest possible time. I hereby decide to suspend the three (3) months imprisonment for a period of two (2) years from to date.
 
The consequence of reoffending during the operational period of suspension is explained to the accused in court and he understood.
 
I further invoked a Domestic Violence Restraining Order with the SNMC against the accused with effect from todate.
 
28 days to appeal.
 
On this 01st day of April 2016.

252233,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Background
 
  
• On the 29th of September 2015 the Appellant pleaded guilty to one count of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 in the Magistrates Court at Nadi.
 
 
• Upon his conviction he was sentenced on the 12th of January 2016 to a term of 9 months’ imprisonment. In addition to the sentence, a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (with a non-molestation order) was issued for the protection of the complainant.
 
 
• The Appellant filed his appeal against the sentence on the 4th of February 2016, and therefore the said appeal is within time.
 

4. The grounds of appeal filed by Counsel for the Appellant are as follows:
 
 
 (i) The sentence is harsh and excessive in the circumstances of the case
 
 (ii) The learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration while sentencing the Petitioner
 

 (iii) The Petitioner was just a first offender and had a previous clean record 
 
 Therefore, a suspended sentence would have been appropriate in the circumstances
 
 
 (iv) That the sentence imposed on the appellant is manifestly harsh and excessive and most unfair in comparison to other cases for the same or similar offences
 
 (v) That the sentencing Magistrate erred in law and in fact to demand for a written mitigation from the Petitioner, when he should have allowed the Petitioner to orally mitigate before the sentencing date.
 
  
• Summary of Facts read to the Appellant was as follows:-
 

 “On the 23rd day of July 2013 at about 12.30am at Navakai, Nadi one Eneri Abbas Ali 21 yrs (accused) barman of NavakaiNadi assaulted Asinate Ledua 20 yrs (complainant), Domestic Duties of NavakaiNadi thereby causing him actual bodily harm.
 
 
 Both the complainant and the accused are living in a defacto relationship at the accused’s house in Navakai, Nadi for about 2 years.
 
 
 On the abovementioned date and time, both had been drinking beer at their home together with some of the accused workmates. Later on they then went on and continued drinking at the Deep Sea Night Club in Nadi Town. Both could not control of themselves and came out and left off to Navakai in a van.
 
 
 After reaching Navakai they then finished the left over bottle of beer that was at their home and later on an argument broke out between the two on some allegation made by the accused on the complainant that she was having an affair in the night club with another boy. The accused than started slapping the complainant on the face and then punched her several times on the face and stomach and also dragged her as a result she received visible injuries to her body as per medical report.
 
 
 The complainant then managed to escape from the assailant and ran to the Navakai hart where her mother is staying. The complainant was then taken cared by her mother and called into the Nadi Police Station at about 11 am and lodged an official complain to the Police. The complainant was then medically examined by doctor at the Nadi Hospital and was admitted for observation.
 
 
 The accused was then later arrested and caution interviewed and admitted the facts of the case as in Q.35 – 38 of his interview. He was then formally charged for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009”.
 
 
Law
 
  
• It is well settled that sentence imposed by a lower court should be varied or substituted with a different sentence on appeal only if it is shown that the sentencing judge had erred in principle or where the sentence imposed is excessive in all the circumstances. 
 

 The Fiji Court of Appeal in Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999) observed:
 
 
 “It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the
 
 appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its
 
 sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499).
 
  
• In Sharma v State [2015] FJCA 178; AAU48.2011 (3 December 2015) the Fiji Court of Appeal discussed the proper approach to be taken by an appellate court when called upon to review the sentencing discretion of a court below: 
 

 “In determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this Court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge. The approach taken by this Court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or, in other words, that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range. It follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the Court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range. However it must be recalled that the test is not whether the Judges of this Court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence. It must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust”.
 
 
Analysis
 
 
Ground (i)
 
  
• The Appellant contends that the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate is harsh and excessive in the circumstances if the case. The Courts in Fiji now view assaults arising within a domestic setting very seriously. This sentencing fashion is reflected in Justice Madigan’s comments in the recent case of State v. Prasad [2015] FJHC 493; HAA 010.2015 (3 July 2015), where his Lordship stated at paragraph [7]:
 

 “A “normal” punishment for a domestic violence assault is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 9 and 12 months with an enhancement up to 18 months if the assault be considered serious. A judicial officer can of course sentence outside that tariff if and only if he or she gives reasons for departing from the tariff.”
 
  
• The term of 9 months’ imprisonment imposed by the learned Magistrate was neither harsh nor excessive as it is clearly within the tariff band.
 
 
• Be that as it may, the learned Magistrate,in light of the circumstances revealed in the summary of facts, should have considered the possibility of rehabilitating the offender since he was a young and first offender. Sections 4(2) (Appellant’s previous good character) and the Section 4 (1) d (possibility of rehabilitation) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree need to be considered before imposing a custodial sentence.
 
 
• The Respondent concedes that the learned Magistrate erred in law when he failed to take into account a relevant consideration namely that the appellant was a first offender.
 
 
• In Singh v State [200] FJHC 264: 2FLR 127 Madam Justice Shameem said: 
 

 “However as a general rule, leniency is shown to first offenders, young offenders, and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse” 
 
  
• Although there was no mitigation filed on the part of the Appellant, this factor (that he was a first offender) was made known to the learned Magistrate on the 29th of September 2015 when the Appellant changed his plea from Not Guilty to Guilty(Page 40 of the Court Record).
 
 
• Appellant has already served more than four months in prison. Therefore I vary the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate and suspend the rest of the imprisonment period for a period of two years. I order the release of the Appellant forthwith. Consequence of violation of the suspended sentence explained to the Appellant.

74248,"SENTENCE

1. Kesaia Disaba and Ratu Aisea Volavola, initially you were charged with the following offence:

Statement of Offence

Grievous Harm: contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

Kesaia Disaba and Ratu Aisea Volavola, on 23rd day of July 2012 at Savura Road, Wailoku in the Central Division unlawfully and maliciously did grievous harm to Adi Alisi Qalirea. 

2. The offence is an indictable offence which is also triable summarily. Both of you opted for a Magistrate's Court trial. You waived the right to have a counsel in court.

3. On 30.07.2012 you pleaded 'Guilty' to the charge. The Court is satisfied that your plea is free from any influence. 

4. Following facts were established in the Summery of Facts presented by the prosecution. The first accused is the wife of the second accused. The victim of this case has been the sister in law of the first accused. She is 21 and mentally handicapped. You share the same residence. 

5. Your neighbour has heard the cries of the victim at around 4.30 in the afternoon. When she looked out from the window she has seen the first accused assaulting the victim with a hose-pipe. Shortly the second accused who is the brother of the victim joined the first accused and started assaulting with the same hose-pipe. The neighbour reported this matter to the police and both of you were arrested. Both admitted the allegation in their caution interview.

6. The victim was later produced before the doctor for examination. The state has produced the medical report of the victim as a part of the Summery of Facts. As per the medical report the doctor has observed multiple bruises and imprints of hose-pipe on her body. The professional opinion confirms the fact that the victim was severely beaten by the accused persons.

7. Section 258 of the Crimes Decree 2009 states that any person commits an offence if he or she unlawfully and maliciously does grievous harm to another person. 

8. The interpretation Section 4 (1) of the Crimes Decree states 'Grievous harm' means any harm which— 

(a) amounts to a maim or dangerous harm; or 

(b) seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely so to injure health; or 

(c) extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or serious injury to any external or internal organ, member or sense; 

9. View of this Court is that the injuries of the victim do not cover under the above interpretation. But it falls within the interpretation of 'Bodily Harm'. 

10. At this point it is prudent to consider the legal interpretation of the term 'Harm'.

""harm"" means any bodily hurt, disease or disorder (including harm to a person's mental health) whether permanent or temporary, and includes unconsciousness, pain, disfigurement, infection with a disease and physical contact with a person that the person might reasonably object to in the circumstances (whether or not the person was aware of it at the time); 

11. Section 160(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 provides provisions to convict a person for a minor offence although he was not charged with it. It says,

s.160 (2) when a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence; the person may be convicted of the minor offence although he or she was not charged with it.

12. Having considered the facts I am of the view that each accused can be convicted for the offence of 'Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm'. Therefore the Court convicts each of you for the offence under section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009.

13. The maximum sentence for the offence is 5 years of imprisonment.

Tariff for the Offence

14. The Tariff for 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm' under Section 245 of the Penal Code (which is now repealed), varies from a suspended sentence to 09 months imprisonment. (per Goundar J in Jonethani Sereka v State [2008]HAA 027/08S, 25 APR 2008) 

15. This Court called a brief background report from the Social Welfare officer of the southern region. Unfortunately it was informed that she was unable to provide a full background report due to the unavailability of the accused persons. She has found that the victim is now looked after by another care giver who is also a tenant of the property. The victim is well looked after by that lady.

16. The report informs that the victim was left with the second accused who is her brother. Her other siblings and mother have left their responsibilities.

17. On the other hand both of you informed Court that you in fact looked after her. Further you said that this assault occurred due to an unmanageable behaviour of the victim. There is no material before this Court to conclude that the victim is a person of such nature. Even though she has such condition it is the duty of the guardians to provide her protection and due care. 

Aggravating Factors

18. The aggravating features of the offence are,

I. The victim had been a mentally disabled female. The victim was vulnerable due to her nature and the domestic relationship;

II. It appears that there was no provocation on the part of the victim;

III. You have used a hose-pipe to assault the victim;

IV. Multiple injuries indicate that you have assaulted her many times.

Mitigating Factors

19. In mitigation both of you stated similar circumstances, you are 22 and 23 years old; first offenders; sole providers of the victim; and you are now remorseful for what happened. 

20. The circumstances of this offence highly warrant an immediate custodial sentence. On the other hand the Court has to consider the plight of the mentally handicapped victim before imposing a custodial sentence to the accused persons. It appears from your submission in Court that both of you are still willing to look after the victim. This attitude gives some idea on the intention you had at the time of offending.

21. Therefore this Court would like to observe whether you comply with the said undertaking as per section 44(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. 

22. Kesaia Disaba and Ratu Aisea Volavola, proceedings of this case is hereby adjourned for a period of 3 years. Each of you has to undertake to ensure the wellbeing of the victim Adi Alisi Qalirea. The matter will be called after every three months and the Social Welfare Officer (Southern/Eastern) should submit a report to Court on the progress. Further both accused should attend to counselling sessions in the family division of this Court once a month.

23. Copies of this order are dispatched to relevant authorities in order to facilitate above conditions of the Court. 

24. Court issues a permanent domestic violence restraining order to Kesaia Disaba and Ratu Aisea Volavola with standard non molestation conditions as per section 24(1)(b)(1) of the Domestic Violence Decree 2009 to further ensure the protection of the victim Adi Alisi Qalirea. 

25. 28 days to appeal. 

Pronounced in open Court,

Yohan Liyanage

78326,"JUDGMENT

The Appellant was convicted on 8 August 2003 at the Labasa Magistrates’ Court on 2 counts of rape. The charges read as follows:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE : Contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17

Particulars of Offence

MEGHNA MURTI s/o Ram Murti, on 27 January, 2002, at Labasa in the Northern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman namely Ashwani Sashi Naidu d/o Govind Sami, without her consent.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE : Contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

MEGHNA MURTI s/o Ram Murti, on 1st day of February 2002, at Labasa in the Northern Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman namely Ashwani Sashi Naidu d/o Govind Sami, without her consent.

The Appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of 5 years imprisonment on each count, each of which to be served concurrently.

The Appellant, as far as the Court can ascertain from both the letter of application and oral submission, is appealing against both conviction and sentence. The State as Respondent, has also counter-appealed on the sentence, upon the following grounds:

“(a) the learned magistrate erred in law when he failed to apply the correct sentencing principles applicable in rape cases, in particular, the correct starting point enunciated by the High Court.

(b) the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when he imposed a sentence that is manifestly lenient having regard to all the circumstances of the case, in particular its aggravating features.”

The Appellant first appeared and pleaded not guilty in the Labasa Magistrates’ Court on 5 August 2003. The victim’s evidence together with those of 3 prosecution witnesses had already been heard. On 8 August, 2003, in the course of the hearing of the victim’s mother’s evidence, the Appellant changed his plea to guilty. The Court informed him of his rights, and thereafter the trial proceeded which finally resulted in the conviction and sentence above.

The facts according to the record are as follows. The victim’s mother had moved with the victim and her younger sister and brother from Wainikoro to Vunika, following the death of her husband. The family initially stayed with the mother’s younger sister, where the Appellant, who is related to the younger sister’s husband, met and formed a close relationship with the victim’s mother. They in fact became lovers. In the end the Appellant and the victim’s mother moved away together with the victim and her siblings tour.

For approximately 2 years the Appellant lived as the head of the victim’s household, although the Appellant’s relationship with the victim’s mother remained as one of common law husband and wife.

On 27 January 2002, the first offence of rape took place. On the day, the Appellant together with the victim’s mother, had taken the Appellant’s mother to the hospital and then later to the Applicant’s brother’s house when the victim’s mother stayed to look after the Appellant’s ailing mother. The victim and her brother and sister stayed on their own in the house, sharing a bedroom of 2 beds. One was occupied by the victim and the other shared by her younger brother and sister. At about 1 a.m. the Applicant returned home and was let in by the victim, who then went straight back to bed. Around 2.30 a.m., the victim was awoken by the Appellant standing over her, naked, a knife in his hand. He then with his other hand pressed his face closing his mouth stopping her from making any sound. After threatening her with the knife if she objected or raised the alarm, he dropped the knife and while still maintaining his right hand pressure on her mouth, pulled her dress up and panties down with his free left hand. The Appellant then forcibly had sex with the victim. The Appellant afterwards threatened the victim with death should she tell anyone of the incident.

The second rape occurred on 1 February 2002. The victim was alone at home when the Appellant returned from Soasoa. The latter asked the victim for sex. The victim refused, and the Appellant threatened with a knife and death reprisal should she reveal all, before he again forcibly had sex with her.

Appellant’s Appeal

The Appellant’s appeal against conviction is premised on the ground that he was tricked into pleading guilty in exchange for a non-custodial sentence. According to the Appellant, the police confronted him during the Court’s adjournment on the second day of hearing, and persuaded him to change his plea to guilty. In return, the Appellant alleges, the police were to secure a non-custodial sentence, instead of 9 years imprisonment if he was found guilty. The Appellant further states that he was easily converted, because of the mental and emotional instability he was under at the trial.

In addition, the Appellant argues that sex with the victim was consensual and in support of this, referred to a letter from the victim obtained by the Appellant and which the Appellant claims had been given to the Labasa Police Station to be handed over to the Court to prove his case.

As to the claim of the police ruse for the Appellant to change his plea, this Court does not find any credible evidence for support such allegation. The record of the proceedings show merely that the Appellant had decided to change his plea soon after the mother of the victim began giving evidence. Thereafter the learned magistrate warned the Appellant and specifically asked him whether there was any pressure exerted on him to change his plea. The Appellant, according to the records, stated that there was no pressure made on him and he wished to changed his plea to guilty “on my own accord.” There cannot be any clearer evidence than this to show that the Appellant had not been persuaded by another to change his plea.

The Appellant’s submission that he had produced to the police a written statement by the victim confirming that sex was consensual is also not proven. Neither was any reference made to it by the Appellant himself in the course of the trial. But even if there was such a statement, the Court would have been very wary of the victim’s voluntariness to make it, given the appellant’s physical presence over her and the threats of bodily harm which he had made to her in the past.

Finally the Appellant makes the point that the victim did not report the rapes to the police, until 3 weeks after the incidents. This tends to support his argument that there was no rape only consensual sex. However, it is clear from the evidence of both the victim and her mother that the Appellant had exerted power over them during and immediately after the offences were committed. There were very little opportunities to let on to the authorities the terrifying ordeals the victim had undergone. The Appellant was always around the only when the victim’s auntie called the police following the Appellant’s abuse of the victim and her mother, did the opportunity present itself.

I am satisfied having reviewed the evidence that the learned magistrate had correctly convicted the Appellant for the 2 counts of rape.

The Appellant’s appeal on sentence, I will deal with together with the prosecution cross-appeal below.

Appeal on Sentence

Both the Appellant and prosecution appealed on the ground of sentence. The Appellant argues that the sentence of 5 years was excessive and amounted to a miscarriage of justice. The prosecution for its part argued to the contrary namely that the sentence was manifestly lenient having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and that the learned magistrate had failed to apply the correct sentencing principles applicable in all rape case.

First, the prosecution submission that the learned magistrate failed to apply the correct sentencing principles. It is clear from the record that the learned magistrate had paid particular attention to these. Not only did he refer to the High Court decisions that provide him authority, but abided by them. The learned magistrate correctly stated that the starting tariff for similar offences was 7 years. He then worked on the aggravating versus the mitigating factors reflecting in the upscaling and downsealing of the sentence. In the end, the learned magistrate concluded that 5 years was the appropriate tariff. Under the circumstances, I do not see any merit in the prosecution’s argument that the learned magistrate had failed to apply the correct sentencing principles. Similarly, its arguments that the sentence was manifestly lenient having regards to all the circumstances of the case, does not succeed. The learned magistrate had taken on board all the relevant factors in favour and against the Appellant and in the exercise of his discretions, arrived at the final 5 years sentence.

The Appellant’s submission that the sentence was excessive, is without merit. If anything, the learned magistrate had been almost lenient in the sentence given the nature of the offence and the relationship of the victim to the Appellant. I do not see any good reason to disturb the findings of the Court below.

In the end, the Court finds no merit in both the Appellant’s appeal and the cross appeal by the Respondent. Each is dismissed.

I make no award as to costs.

250668,"JUDGMENT
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
  
• This is a timely appeal filed by the Appellant against the conviction and sentence of the learned Magistrate at Lautoka.
 
 
• The Appellant was charged with one count of Indecent Assault contrary to Section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. 
 
 
• The trial Magistrate found the Appellant guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly. On the 25th October, 2016, Appellant was sentenced to a term of 18 months’ imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 months.
 
 
• Being dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the Appellant filed a notice of Appeal on the 8th of November, 2016 with following grounds:
 

 GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
  
• That the learned Magistrate erred in law when he failed to note down the summary of facts that he was guilty for in his sentencing remarks.
 
 
• That the learned Magistrate erred in that he took the starting point of 1 year without outlining the circumstances of the facts with which the appellant is charged and pleaded guilty with;
 
 
• That the learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he enhanced 1 year as aggravating factor which does not constitute the offence without outlining the summary of facts, this has caused a miscarriage of justice;
 
 
• The learned sentencing Magistrate erred in law and fact when he failed to give any reason why it took him 4 years to pass a custodial sentence rather than a suspended sentence since the sentence was below 2 years;
 
 
• The learned sentencing Magistrate erred in that he misguided himself with the guideline authority as paragraph 4 of his sentencing when he failed to highlight the facts of the case;
 
 
• That the sentence of 18 months with non-parole period of 12 months is harsh in all circumstances of the case;
 
 
• The learned Magistrate erred in law and principle when he failed to exercise discretion to guide himself with the Sentencing and Penalties Decree;
 
 
• The learned sentencing Magistrate erred in law when he failed to exercise Section 4 (1) (2) and 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• Appellant in his written submission advanced the following grounds of appeal against conviction. 
 

(1) Offence not proved beyond reasonable doubt
 
(2) Conviction and sentence are null and void as the learned Magistrate failed to conform to requirements set out in Section 142 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
 
 
 
LAW RELATING TO APPEALS AGAINST CONVICTION AND SENTENCE
  
• The law relating to appeals against conviction and sentence is set out in Section 246 (1) and (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act

246. — (1) Subject to any provision of this Part to the contrary, any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order of a Magistrates Court in any criminal cause or trial to which he or she is a party may appeal to the High Court against the judgment, sentence or order of the Magistrates Court, or both a judgment and sentence;.. 
 
(4) An appeal to the High Court may be on a matter of fact as well as on a matter of law. 
  
• This Court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2].  
 
 
• In Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999) the Fiji Appeal Court observed:
 

“It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499)”.
 
  
• The Supreme Court, in Naisua v State [2013] FJSC 14; CAV0010.2013 (20 November 2013), endorsed the views expressed in Bae (supra):
 

“It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
 
 (i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
(iii) Mistook the facts;
 
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration. 
 
  
• The Fiji Court of Appeal in Sharma v State [unreported Cr. App. No. AAU0065 of 2012; 2 June 2014] discussed the approach to be taken by an appellate court when reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court. The Court observed: 
 

“In determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this Court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge. The approach taken by this Court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or, in other words, that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range. It follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the Court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range. However, it must be recalled that the test is not whether the Judges of this Court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence. It must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust”
 
 
FACTUAL MATRIX 
 
 
11. The facts accepted by the trial Magistrate are as follows:
 
 
Complainant was renting a flat on ground floor belonging to accused’s mother. On 27th November, 2012, she was home and was near the washtub washing dishes facing washtub when the Accused came behind. Accused touched her private part, squeezed and held onto it. She struggled hard to free herself with her only hand. (her other hand had been amputated after an accident). The accused then threatened her and said ‘if this matter leaks out, I will chop your husband’. The accused then went upstairs. Complainant took her kids and went to town. She did not report to police out of fear and waited her husband to return. On the next day she went to the police station with her husband and reported the matter to police. Accused begged for reconciliation but she moved out of the flat after three days. 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION
 
  
• Learned trial Magistrate accepted the version of the Prosecution and rejected that of the Defence. He had carefully analysed evidence of both sides and given reasons for his decision. 
 
 
• Prosecution had called the complainant and the investigating officer as witnesses. Complainant’s evidence is consistent and reliable. She had made a prompt complaint to police and had relocated herself with her family due to fear of the accused. Complainant had made a prompt complaint to police on the following day. The investigating officer (PW2) who had recorded the statement of the Complainant confirmed that she (complainant) was in a distressed condition when the statement was being recorded. 
 
 
• Trial Magistrate rejected evidence of the Accused and his mother. Reasons given for rejection are well founded. He had highlighted number of material contradictions between evidence of the Accused and his mother. Accused admitted that he lied to police at the caution interview about his alibi. Trial Magistrate found Accused’s caution statement inconsistent with evidence called for Defence. 
 
 
• Accused touched Complainant’s private part, squeezed and held onto it. She struggled hard to free herself with her only hand. Complainant’s evidence which was acted upon by the trial Magistrate proved the elements of Indecent Assault although he had failed to set out the elements of the offence specifically in the Judgment. Defence failed to create any doubt in the Prosecution case. The trail Magistrate’s finding that Prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable doubt is available in evidence.
 
 
• Trial Magistrate had identified points of determination and given his finding on each point. He had given reasons for his decision. Therefore, there is no error on the part of the Magistrate. Two grounds of appeal against conviction are dismissed. 

 
 
 
 APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• Appellant argues that the learned Magistrate erred when he failed to note summary of facts on which the conviction was recorded in his sentencing remarks. 
 
 
• There is no essential need for the sentencing court to summarise the facts in the sentencing remarks. As a matter of good practice, it is desirable for a sentencing magistrate / judge to summarise facts in the sentencing ruing so that the reader, including the appellate court would know, without reading the judgment, on what facts a particular sentence was arrived at. Having gone through the judgment, I am satisfied that the sentence is lawful and not disproportionate to the factual circumstances of the offending. This ground has not merit and is dismissed.
 
 
•  Other grounds of appeal against sentence are based on premises that the learned Magistrate failed to apply sentencing principles and that the sentence is harsh and excessive. Therefore, all these grounds can be dealt with together. 
 
 
• Appellant contends that the sentencing Magistrate erred in law when he picked a starting point of one year without outlining the circumstances of the case. 
 
 
• The sentencing Magistrate correctly cited the guideline judgment and mentioned the tariff for Indecent Assault as between twelve months and four years. He has not specifically mentioned why he picked one year as the staring point. 
 
 
• In picking the starting point a court should be mindful only of objective seriousness of the offence. In gauging the objective seriousness, a sentencing court is supposed to look at culpability factors and harm caused to the victim. As a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. 
 
 
• In Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013) Gounder J observed at paragraph [27] 
 

“In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range”.
 
  
•  Learned sentencing Magistrate picked one year as the starting point from the bottom edge of the tariff. He made no reference to aggravating or mitigating circumstances. He considered only the circumstances of offending (paragraph 5). When the starting point is picked from the bottom end of the tariff, sentencing court is not required to give reasons for doing so as the guideline judgment recommends that the starting point should be picked from within the tariff band preferably from the lower or middle range of the tariff. There is no merit for this ground and should be dismissed.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate cited the correct tariff for the offence of Indecent Assault that is reflected in paragraph [4] that is 12 months to 4 years’ imprisonment as per Ratu Penioni Rokota v State Criminal Appeal No. HAA00068 of 2002 and further noted the observation made by Justice Shameem:
 

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months’ imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence. These are the general principles which affect sentencing under Section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff, although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate. A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.”
 
  
• Learned Magistrate picked the starting point of twelve months from the bottom end of the tariff before adjusting the sentence for aggravating and mitigating features. He reached the final sentence of eighteen months within the tariff.
 
 
• He considered aggravating features and added 12 months. He deducted 6 months for mitigating features and finally arrived at a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, with a non parole period of 12 months.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate further noted the Appellant’s clean record for the past 10 years as a mitigating factor (paragraph [9]) 
 
 
• In his final sentencing remarks learned Magistrate considered the nature of the offending in this case and opined that a custodial sentence is inevitable. In other words, the learned Magistrate had directed his mind whether to suspending the sentence or not. Having considered the circumstances of the offending he decided to impose an immediate custodial sentence.
 
 
• The observation of Justice Shameem in Ratu Penioni Rokota v State (A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.”), in my opinion, has not taken away the discretion of a sentencing court to consider any other ground /s that may prevent a suspended sentence being imposed.
 
 
• In this case, the offence was committed on a vulnerable mother. She is a single handed woman. She was residing in a rented house belonging to Appellant’s mother. After this incident she had to relocate herself with her family out of fear of the Appellant. The Appellant had threatened the Complainant and said ‘if this matter leaks out, I will chop your husband’. Under these circumstances, learned Magistrate’s decision to impose a custodial sentence is not wrong in principle. There is no merit to this ground.
 
 
• The Appellant argues that the learned Magistrate erred in law and in principle when he failed to apply the Sentencing and Penalties Decree [SPD] to guide his sentencing options. Even though the learned Magistrate did not directly quote the applicable section under the SPD, he has considered Section 4 (2) (b), (c) and (d) and further considered Section 18 (3). Therefore, there is no merit to this appeal and should be dismissed.
 
 
• Further, the Appellant argues that the learned Magistrate failed to accord adequate reduction on mitigation factors. This has been considered by the learned Magistrate in paragraphs [8] to [10] of the sentencing Ruling.
 

 Order
 
  
• Conviction recorded by the learned magistrate is lawful and is available in evidence. Sentence is neither excessive nor unreasonable. 
 
 
• I affirm the conviction recorded and sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. The appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed. 
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

70405,"SENTENCE

	1.	Name and the identity of the victim are hereby ordered to suppress permanently with the request of the Prosecution.

	2.	Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula, you have been convicted for one count of Rape: contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 after a full trial. The unanimous verdict of guilty of the assessors was endorsed by this court on 26th of July 2013.

	3.	Count:

Statement of Offence (a)
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 

Particulars of Offence (b)
Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula, on the 01st day of April 2011 and 30th day of June 2011at the Gospel school for the Deaf, Suva in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of S.V. without her consent.

	1.	There was no dispute from the very outset that you had the carnal knowledge of the complainant. You had admitted it during the caution interview as well and you maintained the same position in the trial process. You were adamant that you engaged in sexual activities with the complainant with her full consent. The argument put forward on your behalf was that though you had committed 'ADULTERY', your actions do not fall within the ambit of 'RAPE'. As it was revealed in the trial, you have had penetrated sexual intercourse with the complainant, both to vagina and anus, at least for 06 occasions within the stipulated period in the charge, 01st of April 2011 to 30th of June 2011, within the premises of Harland Hostel for deaf girls. It was revealed that you had sexual intercourse with the complainant in the living room, the bedroom allocated to you and your wife, the bedroom of your daughter, the bedroom used by the complainant with several other girls and inside a toilet of the said hostel. 

	2.	Ms. S. V., the complainant testified in court that you were the care taker of the girl's hostel along with your wife and the 'Bible Teacher' of the school. She had called you 'DADDY'. Evidence transpired in respect of the first sexual intercourse says that you asked the complainant whether she has a boy friend or not and whether she knows anything about 'sex'. When the complainant answered in negative, you had told her that you will teach her 'sex' as it is good to get some experience in 'sex' as she has to marry some day in future. Further, you had told that not to be afraid as ""I am your father and you are my daughter."" You admitted that you were a member of the counseling team of the complainant's school apart from being the Bible teacher and got the opportunity to send the misbehaved girls home had you complained to the school management against them. Your wife, offering evidence on behalf of the defense, endorsed this proposition. Ms. S. V. in her evidence stated that on the first night she had sex with you in the living room, she told you the grievances that she had over other girls in the hostel. It is in this factual back ground the unanimous verdict of guilt came out from the assessors and the court did concur with the same.

	3.	The maximum penalty for the offence of Rape is life imprisonment. The tariff in our jurisdiction for the offence of rape, when sentencing an adult, ranges from 10 – 15 years imprisonment. (see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0021j. 93S (1994) FJCA 25, (27 May 1994); Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Case Appeal Case No. AAU 0025 OF 2003, The State v Bijendra Criminal Case No. HAC 127 of 2011).

	4.	It is worthy of reminding once again what was highlighted in the case of Mohammed Kasim v State (supra):

""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

The Court of Appeal in Mohammed Kasim (supra) went on to say that sentence for any rape case, without aggravating or mitigating features, the starting point should be at least 7 years imprisonment and stressed upon the fact that the particular circumstances of each case may decide what the proper sentence to be, either substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point. Whereas Justice Madigan pointed out in State v Leone Kotobalavu Veresa, (Criminal Case No: HAC 259 of 2013) in recent times with the ever increasing counts of rape coming before High Courts, sentences of 7 to 15 years have been handed down to the perpetrators.

	1.	Justice Gates, as he was then, stated in State v. Marawa (2004) FJHC 338, that:

""Rape is the most serious sexual offence. Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and meting out harsher sentences"" (paragraph 10)

	1.	After a careful consideration of the legal background on Sentencing for the offence of Rape, I now have to decide a starting point for your sentence. This court prefers to have 08 years imprisonment as the starting point, though at the lower range of the tariff, as the court wishes to elaborate the aggravating back ground of the offending in detail.

	2.	The learned State Counsel submitted a comprehensive Sentencing Submission along with the Victim Impact Assessment Report. The learned Counsel for the defense filed his submissions in Mitigation. The Victim Impact Assessment Report clearly reflects the emotional and psychological effects to the victim over the alleged sexual acts.

	3.	As it was literally established in court in the course of the trial and correctly pointed out by the State in their Sentencing submissions, you had abused the authority of your position as the curator of the girl's hostel and the Bible teacher of their school to sexually molest the complainant. Making things worse, you were a member of the school counseling team as well. This demonstrates the back ground of authority you exercised within the circle of hearing impaired and mute girls. You not only misused that authority but willingly molested the complainant at your convenience. I add 03 years imprisonment for this aggravating behavior of yours.

	4.	The evidence of the complainant, as described in paragraph 05 of this sentence, clearly shows how you manipulated the sequence of events to achieve your sexual desires. You made false and fraudulent representations to the complainant about the nature and the purpose of the sexual acts you intended to commit and made her convinced what you said was genuine and true. Ms. V.S. being a grown up girl over 16 years at the time of the incidents and been in this hostel for almost 12 years, going home only for short periods during the school holidays, would have got tempted with your 'soft approach' towards her. This is where you had breached the 'trust' that an ordinary girl would place on a teacher, especially her Bible teacher. You had attempted and you were successful in awakening the youth of the complainant by all your false and fraudulent interpretations over sexual intercourse and in doing so, you just bargained the trust she had to you as a Bible teacher. This aspect is clearly visible when she called you as 'DADDY' and you told her ""not to get afraid as I'm your father and you are my daughter"". For this aggravating factor, I add another 03 years to your starting point.

	5.	It is plainly visible how opportunistic you are in committing these sexual acts. The hostel was occupied mainly by hearing impaired and mute set of girls, including your wife, except your children. You maximized that environment to achieve your perverse behavior. On top of that the vulnerability of the complainant, being a hearing impaired and mute girl who has come from a rural village to secure a better life with education was made worse by your acts of opportunity. You had conveniently forgotten that your elder daughter was also in the same age of the complainant at the time of these incidents. You simply tried to find shelter and justify this opportunistic approach towards the victim by saying that you were not permitted to take leave from work for a long time, not even to visit your sickly father and your physical relationship with your wife was not that healthy. This is surely an aggravating factor and I add 02 years for the same to your starting point.

	6.	Apart from your opportunistic conduct, the acts were very well pre-planned to take calculated risks. Every time you made use of the complainant, you planned it in such a way that nobody else sees you in action. That preplanning could not be to safeguard the chastity of the complainant, but, purely to maintain your image as the Bible teacher of the school and to be a good husband and a father. This was evident when you showed some letters given to you by a 'girl' in the hostel ( it was not established who exactly it was) to your wife, whilst molesting the complainant. This aggravating factor will attract another 01 year to the starting point. Over a period of time, nearly for 02 months, you had repeated the sexual acts for over 06 to 08 times with the complainant. The continuance of the abuse of the complainant will attract another 01 year to the starting point.

	7.	Finally, you showed no remorse to what you did to a hearing impaired and a mute girl, who was in your immediate custody. That is why you made her to undergo the same mental trauma by recalling the bitter experiences from the witness box. You had the audacity to tell that you commit adultery, but not rape and though it is morally wrong, not wrong before the law. Therefore, there is no point of stating in your mitigation submissions that you know the incident was wrong and you are sincerely sorry for that. Lack of remorse, being an aggravating factor, will add another 01 year to your starting point. The interim sentence of you will now remain at 19 years imprisonment.

	8.	In Mitigation, you claim that you are 38 years of age and having three children, who are 17 years, 15 years and 09 years of age by now. Their livelihood solely depends on you. You have not applied any violence towards the victim nor used any weapon. You are a first offender with a previous good character. You have co-operated with the police from the very beginning. According to your analysis, the victim has also contributed to this offence by not informing this to any body and left you at the first opportunity. If you are been incarcerated, the income of the family will be obliterated and the effect on the family will be disastrous. Finally, you are asking for a minimum sentence ranging from 0 to 10 years as the maximum sentence for the offence of rape is 10 years imprisonment. 

(This is a total misdirection as compared to the law stated in paragraphs 06 and 07.) Apart from the fact that you are a first offender with a clean record I see nothing in the mitigation submission to award you any concession. I decide to reduce 03 years out of the interim period of imprisonment for that mitigatory ground. Your final sentence now stands as 16 years imprisonment. I order that you to be served a minimum term of 14 years before being eligible for parole.

	1.	Finally, I must state that the sentence that you are going to receive for this charge of rape is exceeding the tariff limit already in existence. Nevertheless, this court is of the firm view that whatever the sentence you are going to get, must reflect the aggravating back ground of which you committed the acts. Therefore it is inevitable the final sentence to exceed the existing tariff. Your sentence should not only reflect your punishment for what you had done or the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences. Your sentence should contain a strong message to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of this nature in view of protecting the ordinary members of the society.

	2.	No body in a civilized society asks or deserves to be raped. Acts of this nature remind us once again that irrespective of the age or mental and physical impairments of the girls or women, they can be victims of sexual violence. Nobody will be able to justify or offer any valid or acceptable explanation for committing the offence of rape. The responsibility entirely lies on the perpetrator and he should face the aftermath of the insult that he caused to the womanhood at this juncture of sentencing.

	3.	You have 30 days to Appeal to the Court of Appeal.

• Sheik Mohammed Firoz, the Accused, today is for sentencing. 
 
 
• After the trial, the court on its judgment of 16 February 2018, found you guilty as charged for one count of Indecent Assault and one count of Indecently Insulting or Annoying Any Person. You were found to contravene section 212(1) and 213(1)(b) of the Crimes Decree 2009, respectively. 
 
 
• The name of the victim is suppressed to protect her privacy and interest and will be referred to as the victim in this sentence. 
 
 
• The Court’s finding was that in 2013 and 2014, the victim was a student at Vunimoli Islamiya Primary School in Labasa. The Accused was a teacher in the same school. In October 2013, the accused touched the victim’s hip in the classroom. In March 2014, the accused pinched the victim near the side of her breast. 
 
 
• The Accused was convicted as charged for both the counts. The mitigation submission was filed on 20 February 2018. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for Indecent Assault is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff is 12 months to 4 years imprisonment, depending on the nature of the assault. The maximum penalty for Indecently Insulting or Annoying Any Person is 12 months imprisonment. The tariff is from 3 to 6 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• The aggravating factors are ;-
  
• The victim was your student who was in class 8 at the time of the offence.
 
• This is a teacher and student relationship and you breached that trust. 
 
• The victim was under your care and protection when you committed the offences.
 
• You have no respect for the victim.
 
• You took advantage on the vulnerability of the victim at the time of the offence and exploit her with your evil intention.
 

 
• The compelling mitigating factors are ; - 
  
• First offender with 40 years of good character,
 
• Seek the court’s forgiveness,
 
•  Promise not to re-offend.
 

 
• For your sentence, I will start with the offence of Indecent Assault. I pick 2 years as the starting point. I add 1 year for the aggravating factors and that increase your sentence to 3 years imprisonment. I reduce your sentence by 8 months for your mitigation and that reduce your sentence to 2 years and 4 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• You were found guilty after trial and you are not entitle for any plea concession. There was no information from the Prosecution nor the Counsel for the defence on the remand period. In perusing the court record, there is no evidence that you were in remand.
 
 
• Your final sentence for Indecent Assault is 2 years and 4 months imprisonment and that is far above the tariff for Indecently Insulting or Annoying Any Person. Therefore, I pick 5 months as your sentence for Indecently Insulting or Annoying Any Person. 
 
 
• I have considered section 4 of the Sentence and Penalties Act. This is a case of exploitation and breach of trust at the upper category. Considering the principle of rehabilitation and deterrent, I find that deterrent sentence both specific and general need to be imposed to denounce such conduct and as a warning to the people especially when there is a fiduciary relationship.
 
 
• Sheik Mohammed Firoz, I now sentence you as follows;-
  
• Count 1 - Indecent Assault - 2 years and 4 months imprisonment.
 
 
• Count 2 - Indecently Insulting or Annoying Any Person - 5 months imprisonment.
 
 
• Sentence for both the counts to be served concurrently with immediate effects and to be served concurrently with your sentence in Criminal Case No. 158 of 2014.
 
 
• Non- parole period of 18 months.
 


28 days to appeal

254508,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. You, SAIYASI MATARUGU, were charged by this court, for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, which is punishable under Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.
 
 
2. You pleaded guilty for the said offence on the 18th of August 2014 on your own will and accord. I am satisfied that you fully comprehended the legal effect of your plea and your plea was voluntary and free from influence. Further, you admitted to the Summary of Facts that was read over and explained to you in Court, which supported the elements of the charge. As such you are found guilty and convicted by this court as charged, for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm.
 
 
3. Summary of facts, as admitted by you before this court, revealed that this offence was committed on the 19th of April 2014, at After Dark Night Club, Namaka, Nadi.
 
 
4. Further, the summary of facts revealed, that you assaulted the Complainant, your wife.
 
 
On the day of the incident Complainant had come looking for you at the After Dark Night Club, where she had noticed you drinking with another girl. Complainant, then started drinking with her cousin, witness Amelia Tuba.
 
 
After a while the Complainant having noticed you going out with the same girl, followed you and interrupted and informed the girl with you that the Complainant is your wife.
 
 
You thereafter had gone back inside the club and had assaulted the Complainant on her face and head whereby she had fallen on the ground, feeling dizzy and unable to standup.
 
 
As per the Medical Report on the Complainant she has received a 'laceration on the upper lip with clots noted on the injury site and left side lip swollen. Further there had been an open wound {0.5cm) lateral to left side lip'.
 
 
You have admitted to the allegation when questioned under caution during police investigations.
 
 
5. Submissions in mitigation inter alia has prayed for not to record a conviction. The ground on which this plea is made is your employment as a police officer and the consequences a conviction would have on your employment.
 
 
State in filing sentencing submissions had opposed this application.
 
 
This court shall explore the legal boundaries of this application before moving on to decide a suitable sentence on you.
 
 
The application not to record a conviction is based on the provisions of section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. However it is interconnected with the range of sentencing orders a court can make under section 15 of the Decree. I shall reproduce here both the sections for the sake of clarity.
 
 
Section 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree:
 
 
(1) If a court finds a person guilty of an offence, it may, subject to any specific provision relating to the offence, and subject to the provisions of this Decree-
 
 
(a) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment;
 
 
(b) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment partly in custody and partly in the community;
 
 
(c) record a conviction and make a drug treatment order in accordance with regulations made under section 30;
 
 
(d) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment that is wholly or partly suspended;
 
 
(e) with or without recording a conviction, make an order for community work to be undertaken in accordance with the Community Work Act 1994 or for a probation order under the Probation of Offenders Act [Cap. 22];
 
 
(f) with or without recording a conviction, order the offender to pay a fine;
 
 
(g) record a conviction and order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court;
 
 
(h) record a conviction and order the discharge of the offender;
 
 
(i} without recording a conviction, order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court;
 
 
(j} without recording a conviction, order the dismissal of the charge; or
 
 
(k} impose any other sentence or make any other order that is authorized under this Decree or any other Act.
 
 
(Sub-Sec. 2-5 not relevant for the purpose)
 
 
Section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree:
 
 
(1} In exercising its discretion whether or not to record a conviction, a court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including­
 
 
(a) the nature of the offence;
 
 
(b) the character and past history of the offender; and
 
 
(c) the impact of a conviction on the offender's economic or social well-being, and on his or her employment prospects. (Sub-Sec.2 & 3 not relevant)
 
 
6. It is clear from the above two sections that not recording a conviction would limit the range of sentencing orders a court can make and as such shall be sparingly exercised. Thus it cannot be said that at any instance a court finds a ground under section 16 is satisfied a conviction should not be recorded. Certainly there should be a criteria to exercise the discretion of the court not to record a conviction largely owing, in my view, to the nature and seriousness of a charge among many other considerations.
 
 
As the counsel for the State has correctly highlighted the case of Botaki v State [2012]
 
 
FJHC 1250; HAA015.2012 (1 August 2012) clearly highlights these considerations.
 
 
In this case Hon. Justice P. Madigan held thus;
 
 
""The operative word in this section is //discretion11
 
 
Just because an offender will lose his job/ and just because he will be affected economically does not mean that it is mandatory for a Magistrate to invoke the provisions of this Section. Where a Magistrate has exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power, that it would be in a very exceptional circumstances that an appellate court would interfere with that exercise.
 
 
8. This is particularly so in cases of Domestic Violence which this case is. The Domestic Violence Decree is clearly a Decree which aims to provide greater protection from Domestic Violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not record a conviction against a perpetrator.
 
 
9. The appellant has pleaded guilty to the offence and admits facts which go to the elements of the offence. The fact that he holds a career position as a Vice Principal is of no moment. This Court treats perpetrators alike be they poor or rich/ of high or lowly status.
 
 
10. The appeal against conviction is dismissed.//
 
 
In the highest sense of clarity the High Court of Fiji has ruled out 'domestic violence offences' from the range of offences a court can act without recording a conviction. Thus your plea for not to record a conviction is hereby refused and accordingly the conviction is recorded.
 
 
7. I now turn to decide a suitable sentence on you. I shall consider the appropriate sentence on you under the general principles and guidelines on sentencing and range of sentencing orders as set out in Sections 04 and 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 in line with the objectives thereof. I shall further give special attention to Section 4 (3) of the Decree which reads as follows;
(3) In sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence, a court must also have regard to -
 
 
(a) any special considerations relating to the physical, psychological or other characteristics of a victim of the offence, including-
 
 
(i) the age of the victim;
 
 
(ii) whether the victim was pregnant; and
 
 
(iii) whether the victim suffered any disability;
 
 
(b) whether a child or children were present when the offence was committed, or were otherwise affected by it;
 
 
(c) the effect of the violence on the emotional, psychological and physical well-being of a victim;
 
 
(d) the effect of the offence in terms of hardship, dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim;
 
 
(e) the conduct of the offender towards the victim since the offence, and any matter which indicates whether the offender –
 
 
(i) accepts responsibility for the offence and its consequences;
 
 
(ii) has taken steps to make amends to a victim, including action to minimize or address the negative impacts of the offence on a victim;
 
 
(iii) may pose any further threat to a victim;
 
 
(f) evidence revealing the offender's - (i) attitude to the offence;
 
 
(ii) intention to address the offending behaviour; and
 
 
(iii) likelihood of continuing to pose a threat to a victim; and
 
 
{g) whether the offender has sought and received counseling or other assistance to address the offending behaviour, or is willing to undertake such counseling or seek such assistance.
 
 
8. Having said that, I shall now explore the prescribed penalty and the tariff for this offence.
The maximum punishment for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is 05 years of imprisonment.
 
 
The tariff for this offence; ""...ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 09 months imprisonment for the more serious case of assault"" State v Anjula Devi (Criminal Case No. 04 of 1998 lab) as cited with approval by Hon. Justice Goundar in Sereka v State (2008) FJHC 88, HAA027.2008
{25 April 2008). Hon. Justice Madigan held in State v Sikitora (2010) FJHC 466;
 
 
HAC067.2010l{22 October 2010) that ""The cases of Elizabeth Joseph v State {2004) HAA 03 of 2004 and State v Tevita Alati (2004) HAA 73 of 2004 establish a tariff 09 months to 12 months imprisonment, the severity of the wound being the determining factor in the starting point. However, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld in Domestic Violence cases Amasi Korovata v State {2006) HA 115 of 2006"".
 
 
9. As per the facts, I do not conclude that this incident was unprovoked. Further there are no weapons used in the commission of the offence. However the injuries on the Complainant appear to be moderate as per the medical report. As per above facts and circumstances I conclude that this offence warrants a prison term and accordingly selects 09 months imprisonment as the starting point.
 
 
The fact that you have seriously breached the trust reposed on you by the Complainant as her husband and the fact that by assaulting her in public reflected cruel and degrading treatment towards the Complainant clearly aggravates the offence.
 
 
To reflect upon the aggravating factors I add 10 months to your sentence bringing your sentence up to 19 months.
 
 
10. I now consider the facts in mitigation.
 
 
• You are a young first offender and a well-respected police officer amongst your superior officers having a 10 year service history.
 
• You express remorse and promise not to reoffend.
 
 
• You have a family with a young child that you financially support.
 
 
• You have pleaded guilty to the offence saving time and resources of court and the state.
 
 
To reflect the mitigating factors (except for the early guilty plea) I discount your sentence by 04 months and the guilty plea is separately discounted for by a further 05 months.
Thus the final sentence on you for the offence of 'Assault occasioning Actual Bodily harm' is 10 months imprisonment.
 
 
11. Having in mind the provisions of Sec.26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I do concede that this court has the power to suspend your sentence since it is less than 02 years of imprisonment.
 
 
12. Directing my mind on the guideline cases on suspension of sentences; DPP v Jolame Pita (1974) 20 FLR 5 and more recently DPP v Saviriano Radovu (1996) 42 FLR 76 and Deo v State (2005) FJCA 62, I shall consider whether there are any special circumstances to justify a suspension of your sentence.
 
 
13. Upon the above line of authorities I find the following facts to exist in this case.
 
 
• Conduct on the part of the Complainant partially provoking the incident.
 
 
• No serious or permanent physical injuries caused to the Complainant.
 
 
• Being a person of good character having a clear criminal record for the past 33 years.
 
 
• No weapons used in the commission of the offence.
 
 
• No evidence of continuous violence towards the Complainant.
 
 
• No evidence of past history of domestic violence.
 
 
14. Accordingly, I am of the view that you should be availed of another opportunity to rehabilitate in the main stream without getting mixed with hardened criminals within the four corners of a prison cell. In the interest of justice, I am therefore satisfied that above factors are to be considered special circumstances justifying a suspension of your sentence.
 
 
15. You are therefore explained of the scope and effect of a suspended sentence and further the consequences that would follow if you commit another offence during the period of suspension.
 
 
Having explained the same, I now proceed to suspend your sentence for a period of 03 years.
 
 
16. In the final outcome, your sentence is 10 months imprisonment term suspended for 03 years.
 
 
17. Further to your imprisonment term, considering the fact that this offence is one of domestic violence, I further make the Interim DVRO; issued against you on the 30th April 2014, on standard non molestation condition, a final Domestic Violence Restraining Order, pursuant to sec.24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Decree. This Domestic Violence Restraining Order shall be in force until and unless varied or suspended by a competent court. Breach of this order shall result in you being charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant to sec.77 of the Domestic Violence Decree.
 
 
18. You have 28 days to Appeal.

	4.	Under the Crimes Decree no. 44 of 2009, the prescribed penalty for Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm under section 275 is a maximum imprisonment term of 5 years. 

	5.	The tariff for the offence of Common Assault and Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment (see: State v Salote Tugalala, HAC025 of 2008).

Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA073/04S stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence....Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld (Amasai Korovata v. The State [2006] HAA 115/06S).

80529,"SENTENCE

1. In a judgment delivered on 28th May 2010, the court found you guilty as charged on one count of ""indecent assault"", contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 17 (ie. count No.1), two counts of ""rape"", contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (ie. count Nos. 2 and 3), and one count of ""incest"", contrary to section 178(1) of the Penal Code (ie. count No.6). You were convicted as charged on all those counts.

2. The brief facts of the case were as follows. On 9th November 1995, you married Mele Duribalavu. On 15th October 1996, you two had your first child, Seruwaia Mafi, the complainant. She was your eldest daughter. You then had two more girls from your wife, until you two separated in 2005. The custody of the girls were given to you. In January 2006, you and the three girls resided at 39 Wailea Street Vatuwaqa. Your abuse on Seruwaia started at this address. Between the 26th and 27th January 2006, you indecently assaulted Seruwaia, who was 9 years 3 months old at the time. You indecently kissed her, touched her breast and fondled her vagina.

3. You then moved to another residence, at Lot 7 Vusavusa Road, Vatuwaqa in February 2006. Between the 11th and 18th February 2006, your abuse on Seruwaia reached another level. One night you woke Seruwaia from her sleep, told her to take off her clothes, then you raped her by forcefully inserting you erected penis into her vagina, until you ejaculated. Seruwaia did nothing and said nothing. You then next shifted to 140 Fletcher Road, Vatuwaqa with the three girls. At that address, you again forced yourself on Seruwaia, between the 19th and 28 February 2006. You forcefully inserted your erected penis into Seruwaia's vagina in the bathroom. You carried on for about 3 minutes, until Seruwaia pleaded for you to stop, as it was hurting her. You did stop, had your bath and went out of the bathroom.

4. In May 2006, you next moved in with a pastor at Namara Settlement, Newtown. You took your three girls with you. Between the 1st and 31st May 2006, you again forced yourself on Seruwaia, who was aged 9 years 7 months, at the time. One night, you told Seruwaia to take off her pants, you then massaged your penis with oil, and then forcefully inserted it into her vagina, until you ejaculated.

5. The court has carefully read your antecedent report, and your well prepared written plea in mitigation. It has also read the victim's impact report. The court noted you are first offender, at the age of 42 years old. It also noted that you are divorced, with three young daughters. You are a pastor in a Christian church, and you are very remorseful for the offences.

6. You have committed three sexual offences against your daughter. In terms of seriousness, the rape offence is the most serious, followed by incest and then indecent assault. We will begin with the offence of rape.

7. Rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Since Seruwaia Mafi was aged 9 years 4 months at the time of the rape, the case is really about the rape of a child. The tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 13 years imprisonment. See State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; Tevita Poese v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0010 of 2005, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Fong Toy, Criminal Appeal Case No. HAA 003 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v Nacanieli Marawa, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2003, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence passed will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

8. Committing ""incest"" against a child under 13 years carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The tariff for incest against a child under 13 years old is a sentence between 10 to 14 years imprisonment: Babu Ram v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0023 of 2004L, High Court, Lautoka. The actual sentence will again depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

9. The maximum sentence for ""indecent assault"" is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff is a sentence between 1 to 4 years imprisonment: Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 068 of 2002, High Court, Suva; State v Viliame Tamani, Criminal Case No. HAC 007 of 2003S, High Court, Suva. Again the actual sentence passed, will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors. 

10. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows: 

(i) Serious breach of parental trust. Seruwaia was 9 years 4 months old when you indecently assaulted her, and then raped her twice in February 2006. She was already traumatized by the break up of your family in 2005. She looked to you for fatherly support and guidance, in her young life. She trusted you as a father. You were supposed to respond in kind. You were supposed to guide and counselled her to become a strong and confident young girl. However, you did exactly the opposite. You ruined her world by indecently assaulting her, and raping her twice. Then you committed incest on her.

(ii) Your daughter Seruwaia appears to be emotionally scarred for life. According to the victim impact report, she repeatedly has emotional mood swings. At times, she cries without a reason. She has very low self esteem. She is frightened of you, and frighten most of the time. She gets so angry easily, and wants to be left alone on most occasions. She stares a lot. Her school grades have deteriorated. She shuts down when questioned. On occasions, she changes from a happy little girl to an angry one, and then a dump one.

(iii) According to her medical report, dated 12th June 2009, at the age of 12 years 8 months old, Seruwaia is sexually active. She has been touched by a cousin, and according to the report, a shopkeeper in Rewa Street performed oral sex on her. These are the by-products of your offending. You turned your own daughter into this kind of world. Instead of living her life as a young innocent girl, she is now being exposed to the above kind of world. In a sense, your have ruined her life as a child, given your offending. 

(iv) Through your offending, you have shown a total disregard to Seruwaia's right to live a happy and peaceful life, not only as a child, but also when she grows into the adult world.

11. The mitigating factors were as follows:

(i) At the age of 42 years old, this is your first offence.

(ii) You pleaded guilty to the indecent assault charge (count No.1) at the beginning of the trial.

(iii) You are remorseful.

(iv) You have spent a few weeks in prison, while being remanded in custody.

12. On the rape charge, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 17 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 2 years from the 17 years, leaving a balance of 15 years imprisonment.

13. On the incest charge, I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I add 4 years, making a total of 15 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year from the 15 years, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment.

14. On the indecent assault charge, I start with a sentence of 2 years prison. I add 2 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 4 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year, leaving a balance of 3 years.

15. I sentence you as follows:

Count No. 1 - 
indecent assault -
3 years imprisonment
Count No. 2 - 
Rape -
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 3 - 
rape -
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 6 - 
incest -
14 years imprisonment

16. Given the principle of the totality of sentence, I order all the above sentences to be made concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 15 years imprisonment.

17. To assist Seruwaia recover from her ordeal, her name, including that of her father, are suppressed permanently, to protect her privacy.

	3.	Considering the facts in this case I take 06 months as the starting point for your sentence. 

Aggravating Factors 

	1.	The victim is your de facto wife. Therefore this comes under the definition of domestic violence. For this I add 03 months to reach 09 months. 

Mitigating Factors 

	1.	You are 45 years old married with 03 children. You asked for forgiveness from this Court. For these mitigating factors I deduct 03 months from your sentence to reach 06 months imprisonment. 

	2.	For pleading guilty in the first available opportunity I follow the decision in Vilimone v State [2008] and deduct 1/3 from your sentence to reach 04 months imprisonment. 

	3.	You are not a first offender and therefore not entitled for discounts for your past good behavior. 

	4.	Section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree has given powers to this Court to suspend a sentence which does not exceed two years. 

	5.	You were shown your previous convictions by the prosecution and you admitted them. From that I note that your last three convictions were for the same kind of offences. This shows that you continue to behave in this manner and not wanting to learn from the mistakes. 

	6.	Also in C.F. 125/2012 for the same kind of offence you were given a suspended sentence for 02 years by this Court on 04/06/2012. This offence was committed on 25/11/2012 which falls within the operational period of that sentence. 

	7.	Having given you a chance this Court notes that you have not tried to reform. Therefore I do not see any reason to fully suspend your sentence in this case. 

	8.	But considering your family and children and hardship they will face this Court is prepared to give you a partly suspended sentence. 

	9.	Accordingly you will be sentenced to 04 months for this offence. From this you will serve 01 month in correction center and remaining 03 months will be suspended for 03 years. 

	10.	If you commit any crimes during 03 years you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties decree. 

	11.	Also this Court grants a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non molestation conditions in favor of the victim. 

	12.	28 days to appeal.

255387,"SENTENCE
 
  
• In a judgment delivered yesterday, the court found you guilty and convicted you on the following count:

FIRST COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE:  Contrary to Section 207(1) and (2)(a) and (3) of the Crimes Act of 2009
 
Particulars of Offence
 
GOVIND SAMI RAJU between the 1st day of May 2016 and the 31st day of May 2016 at Nasinu in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of R. R. C, an 11 year old girl.
 
  
• The brief facts were as follows. Between the 1 and 31 May 2016, you were 85 years old, a retired driver and residing at 10 Miles Nasinu. Your wife died in 2010, and all your 6 children were grown up and married. You owned a two storey flat, and rented the top flat to the 11 year old female complainant (PW1) and her family. PW1 lived with her mother and 5 other siblings. Their father died in 2013. Next to her family’s flat was your flat, where you had your bedroom. Sometime between 1 and 31 May 2016, you took PW1 into your bedroom, undressed her, put her onto your bed, and had sexual intercourse with her. You had been tried and convicted in the High Court. 
 
 
• The rape of children is always a serious matter, and Parliament had prescribed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment: section 207 (1) of the Crimes Act 2009. The Supreme Court of Fiji had set the tariff of 10 to 16 years imprisonment for the rape of children: see Anand Abhay Raj v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0003 of 2014. Of course the final sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.
 
 
• In this case, the aggravating factors were as follows:
  
• (i) Breach of Neighbourly Trust: The 11 year complainant (PW1) treated you as her grandfather and called you “Tata”. You were also their landlord. Your flat was next to the complainant’s family’s flat. Prior to the incident, there was good will and trust between you and the family. They felt safe around you, however unbeknown to them, you were harbouring bad intentions inside you. Sometime in May 2016, you called the 11 year complainant into your bedroom and raped her. This was obviously a serious breach of neighbourly trust.
 
 
• (ii) Rape of Child: The court had said in the past and will say again that it will not tolerate the abuse of children, the future of this country. It will keep on passing long prison sentences, as warning to would-be child rapist. Despite the above, you saw fit to rape this child. You must not complain when your liberty is taken away to pay for your crime. You cunningly exploited the naivety of the child to satisfy your evil intention.
 
 
• (iii) By offending against the complainant, you had no regards to her right as a child, no regard to her rights as a human being, and no regards to her right to live a happy and peaceful life.
 

 
• The mitigating factors were as follows: 
• (i) At the age of 87 years old, this was your first offence.
 
• (ii) You had been remanded in custody for approximately 2 months.
 

 
• I start with a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I add 3 years, making a total of 13 years imprisonment. I deduct 3 months for time already served, while remanded in custody, leaving a balance of 12 years 9 months imprisonment. For being a first offender at the age of 87 years, I deduct 2 years 9 months, leaving a balance of 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Mr Govind Sami Raju, for raping the 11 year old female complainant between 1 and 31 May 2016 at Nasinu in the Central Division, I sentence you to 10 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
• Pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the above sentence was designed to punish you in a manner which was just in all the circumstances, to protect the community from people like you, to deter other would-be child rapist and to signify that the court and the community denounce the rape and sexual abuse of children.
 
 
• The name of the female complainant (PW1) is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.
 
 
• You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

268515,"SENTENCE
 
  
• Mr. Aminio Turagava (herein after referred to as the Accused), now stands convicted after trial. 
 
 
• Accused was charged with Murder, contrary Section 237 of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009. Assessors unanimously found the Accused guilty of Murder as charged. Court concurred with the opinion of the Assessors and found the accused guilty.
 
 
• Counsel for the accused withdrew after filing mitigation submission. Accused indicated to Court that he intends to file mitigation afresh. He was given two mention days to file mitigation. But he failed and informed Court that he is not filing any further submission. 
 
 
• The facts of the case were that:
 

Accused is a thirty-four-year-old father of two children. He was in a de-facto relationship with the deceased and was living separately after a dispute in relation to which a Domestic Violence Restarting Order was in operation. He visited his de facto wife to force her to withdraw the Court case that was to be called on the day of the unfortunate incident. A series of violent activities, followed by an argument, lasted for a considerable period of time. Last punch he dealt on her head caused her to fall down on the ground. He stomped on her head twice when she was lying down on the cement floor. Warnings of neighbours who came to rescue her fell on his deaf ears. She was bleeding from her years, nose and mouth and was later abandoned by the Accused in the bush. She was pronounced dead upon admission to hospital. Pathologist who conducted the postmortem attributed her death to subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by blunt force. In the cautioned interview, Accused admitted punching and kicking on her head three to four times.
 
  
• The sentence for the offence of murder is fixed by law. For a person who is convicted of Murder, the penalty is a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, with a judicial discretion to set a minimum term to be served before pardon may be considered. 
 
 
• The sentencing judge has a discretion to fix the minimum term. Discretion should be exercised judiciously having taken into consideration the nature of the offending, aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
 
 
• In State v Singh[2009] FJHC 27; HAC072.2008 (4 February 2009)Justice Gounder said: 
 

""In my view, there are no hard and fast rules for minimum term in murder cases. Each case is to be assessed on its own facts. If the court finds aggravating features present in a case of murder, the court has discretion to fix minimum term, after weighing the aggravating circumstances against any mitigating factors"".
 
  
• In State v Masicola [2015] FJHC 411 (5 June 2015) Justice Temo said:
 

The offence of ""murder"" (count no. 1) is often said to be at the top of the criminal calendar. To preserve human life is a fundamental objective in preserving and maintaining the wellbeing of our society. Our lawmakers had prescribed a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment for those found guilty of murder. The court is empowered ""to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon may be considered"" (Section 237 of the Crimes Decree 2009). A pardon may only be granted by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji (Section 119 of the 2013 Fiji Constitution). Minimum terms for murder had been set between 26 to 11 years imprisonment, depending on the mitigating and aggravating factors: Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji; The State v Navau Lebobo, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2002, High Court, Suva: State v Anesh Ram, Criminal Case No. HAC 124 of 2008, High Court, Suva and State v Tukana, Criminal Case No. HAC 021 of 2009, High Court, Lautoka.
 
  
• An offender convicted of Murder will have demonstrated a high level of culpability. Even so, the precise level of culpability has to be decided in light of the circumstances of the offending and whether the offence was planned or spontaneous. Accused did not use a weapon. There is no evidence of pre planning. Accused said he was angry and under the influence of liquor. 
 

Aggravating Factors
 
 
 Prolonged Violence 
  
• Accused demonstrated a high level of violent behavior when he attacked his de facto wife in the presence of neighbors who were trying to rescue her. Violence lasted for a considerable period of time.
 

Domestic Violence 
 
  
• This is a classic case of domestic violence that must attract higher sentence. Since domestic violence takes place within the context of a current or past relationship, the history of the relationship will often be relevant in assessing the gravity of the offence. Therefore, a Court is entitled to take into account anything occurring within the relationship as a whole, which may reveal relevant aggravating or mitigating factors.
 
 
• Violent conduct of the Accused had forced his de facto wife to desert him. There was a pending Family Court case where a Domestic Violence Restraining Order was in operation. He wanted her to withdraw the case by hook or by crook. If he failed to do so, he was even prepared to go to jail, taking responsibility for harming her.
 
 
• Accused breached the trust in the de-facto relationship. Trust implies a mutual expectation of conduct that shows consideration, honesty, care and responsibility. An abuse of trust, whether through direct violence or emotional abuse, represents a violation of this understanding; an abuse of power in a relationship involves restricting another individual's autonomy which is sometimes a specific characteristic of domestic violence. 
 
 
• The Accused exploited the victim's vulnerability. He committed this crime in an attempt to use the power he exercised over his de facto wife to prevent her from seeking and obtaining help from Courts. Any steps taken to prevent the victim obtaining assistance aggravated the offence. 
 

Mitigating Factors 
 
  
• Offending was spontaneous. There is no evidence of pre planning. 
 
 
• Accused has one previous conviction. He does not get any discount for his previous character. He is sorry for what he had done to his de facto wife and now repents and blames himself for losing his self-control in his anger and drunkenness. He begs for mercy of the Court. 
 
 
• There is no evidence of sudden provocation for him to loos self control. Accused was drunk at the time of the incident. However, there is no evidence that his drunkenness affected his judgment. 
 
 
• Accused has not shown any remorse in Court. However, he had admitted punching and kicking his wife when he was caution interviewed. Hecooperated with police in investigations. 
 
 
• Accused is caught up in this unfortunate incident in the peak of his youth. Court is sorry that he has committed this offence in his youth ruining his entire life.
 
 
• Accused had been in remand for nearly fifteen months.
 

Sentence
 
 
Having considered every aspect, I sentence the Accused to life imprisonment with a fixed minimum term of 15 years' imprisonment before being eligible for parole. 
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

251050,"JUDGMENT 
 
Chandra, JA
 
 
[1] I agree.
 
 
Prematilaka, JA
 
 
[2] This appeal arises from the conviction of the Appellant on a single count under section 207 (1) and [2] (a) of the Crimes Decree, 2009 (now the Crimes Act, 2009) alleged to have been committed on 22 September 2011. The Amended Information dated 03 June 2013 describes the particulars of the count as the Appellant having had carnal knowledge of P (name withheld) without her consent.
 
 
[3] After trial the three assessors expressed a unanimous opinion that the Appellant was guilty of the said count. The Learned High Court Judge on 07 June 2013, having concurred with their opinion, convicted the Appellant and imposed a sentence of 08 years of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 06 years which should really have been stated as the period during which the Appellant would not become eligible to be released on parole in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 (now Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009). 
 
 
 Preliminary observations
 
 
[4] The Appellant had invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal against the said conviction and sentence by way of a letter dated 09 June 2013 addressed to the Court of Appeal Registry. Several additional grounds of appeal had been submitted later. Written submissions on behalf the Appellant and the Respondent also had been tendered on all grounds of appeal. Chandra RJA had allowed leave to appeal in respect of 04 grounds of appeal against the conviction and on a single ground of appeal against the sentence on 01 August 2014. The Appellant had not sought to have the application for leave to appeal determined before the Court duly constituted to hear and determine the appeal under section 35(3) of the Court of Appeal Act relating to other grounds where leave was refused. 
 
 
[5] The Appellant in person and the Respondent had tendered written submissions, where both parties had confined themselves to the grounds of appeal allowed by Chandra RJA, and at the hearing the Counsel for the Appellant and the Respondent also followed suit. 
 
 
Grounds of Appeal 
 
 
[6] Therefore, the grounds of appeal that would be considered by this Court are as follows. 
 
 Ground 1
 
 
 (i) ‘The Learned Trial Judge acted unfairly against the Appellant in his summing up at paragraph 26 line 9 to line 10, when he made an adverse inference after stating that Defence witness Siteri Gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner.' 
 

Ground 2
 
 
 (ii) ‘The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the complainant and the supporting witnesses had been inconsistent and significant material evidence being that the alleged bed sheet was not tendered .’ 
 

Ground 3
 
 
 (iii) ‘The Learned Trial Judge erred in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the doctor was not called to confirm allegations via a medical certificate on the presence of injuries as alleged by the complainant (PW1) and her aunt (PW3).’ 
 

Ground 4
 
 
 (iv) 'That the learned judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct himself that the guilty verdicts are unreasonable based on the paucity of evidence led by prosecution at the trial.'
 

Ground on Sentence
 
 
 (v) ‘The Learned Judge erred in law when he failed to discount the appellant's period in remand separately from the mitigating factors.'
 

 Summary of evidence
 
 
[7] The complainant, an un-married woman of 21 years and the Appellant, 36 years old and a father of two minor children had met each other following an accidental telephone call and a love affair had begun between the two. At about 11.00 p.m. on 21 September 2009 the Appellant had called the complainant and insisted that she should bring the camera to Tacirua and she had agreed, reluctantly though, to come just to handover it and return home. As soon as she arrived in Tacirua in a taxi, the Appellant and his nephew had got in and instructed the taxi driver to go to Newtown. When they reached Newtown, the Appellant had requested the complainant to get down from the taxi and come to his friend's place. The complainant had agreed but had told the Appellant that she could not stay long. All of them had then gone to the Appellant's friend's house. After a while, she had begged him to allow her to leave but the Appellant had not acceded to her request. Thereafter, the Appellant had got his friend's family to vacate the bedroom and sleep in the sitting area so that the Appellant and the complainant could use the bedroom. 
 
 
[8] Once inside the bedroom, the Appellant had begged her to have sex with him but she had refused. He had tried to kiss her and pushed her onto the bed but no sexual intercourse had taken place in the night. They had breakfast in the house next door and once again the Appellant had gone inside the said bedroom and asked the complainant to follow. While both of them were inside the bedroom the Appellant had tried to kiss the complainant and tried very hard to remove her garments. She had pushed him away but the Appellant had got on top of her despite her resistance. When she tried again to push him away he had pushed her forehead down on the bed and landed two punches on her thighs. She had told him that she did not want to have sex with him. Thereafter, the Appellant had penetrated her vagina with his penis. She had still resisted by pushing him away but the Appellant had then throttled her neck. At that point, unable to resist any longer she had given in and the Appellant's penis had kept moving in and out of the complainant's vagina for about 05 minutes. She had once again said that she did not agree to what the Appellant was doing to her. 
 
 
[9] After the act, the Appellant had given some hot water to the complainant to clean herself and also called his friend to see what had happened i.e. the blood on her and the bed. According to the complainant the blood had came from her vagina. Both of them had then left in a taxi to go to her aunt's place with whom she was staying at Laucala Beach. She had not complained to the police on her way home as the Appellant was in the taxi and she was scared to do so. Upon reaching home, the aunt had observed that the complainant was weak and asked her what had happened. She had told the Aunt that the Appellant had raped her and both had agreed that the complainant should report the matter to police. Accordingly, the complainant had made a complaint to the police on 23 September as she was too weak to do so on the same day and she had been later taken to CWM hospital on 26 September. She was emphatic that the Appellant had raped her. 
 
 
[10] The complainant's aunt Seini Lagakali had seen the complaint's hands and face or forehead swollen; looking dirty, ugly and shattered on her arrival along with a boy or a man whom Seini identified as the Appellant. She had been confused and not confident. Seini had questioned her and the complainant had told her that the Appellant had raped her. She had suggested going to the police and the complainant had agreed. Accordingly, both of them had visited Valelevu Police Station and given statements. 
 
 
[11] The Appellant's counsel had conceded at the close of the prosecution case that there was a case for the Appellant to answer. However, the Appellant did not testify but called Siteri Gade, the wife of Dike Manasa in whose house the alleged act of rape had taken place. Dike Manasa had been a close friend of the Appellant. Siteri on her own had revealed that she was staying in Woman's Prison at Korovou at the time of giving evidence. She confirmed that the Appellant and the complainant, whom she had seen for the first time, had come in the early hours of 22 September to their house while they were sleeping and later at the request of the Appellant, she along with her husband had allowed them to use the bedroom while they slept in the sitting room. In the morning the Appellant and the complainant had had breakfast and after breakfast both had gone into the bedroom. After a while both had come out of the bedroom and the complainant had been normal. She had not said anything to her but had taken a shower. Siteri had given her some clothes. Both had left their house at about 4.00 p.m. After they left, Siteri had removed the bed sheet and laundered it but had seen nothing on it. 
 
 
[12] I shall now deal with the grounds of appeal.
 
 
Ground 1 - ‘The Learned Trial Judge acted unfairly against the Appellant in his summing up at paragraph 26 line 9 to line 10, when he made adverse inference after stating that Defence witness Siteri Gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner.' 
 
 
 [13] Before I proceed any further I should place on record the observations of His Lordship the Chief Justice in Ananda Abey Raj v The State CAV 0003of 2014: 20 August 2014 [2014 FJSC 12] on the complaints of any non-direction and misdirection in appeal. Quoting the following remarks made in Segran Murti v The State Crim. App. No. CAV0016 of 2008S: 12 February 2009 ([2009] FJSC 5) paragraphs 11, 15, 21-23 and Truong v The Queen [2004] HCA10; 2004 ALJR 473, His Lordship said 
‘In the instant case, counsel for the Petitioner was asked by the trial judge whether he sought any re-direction at the end of the summing up. Counsel agreed with prosecuting counsel there was nothing else to direct on ......... This omission is in itself usually sufficient to disregard a ground such as is raised here.’ 
[14] In Ananda Abey Raj’s case His Lordship the Chief Justice further commented upon the failure of both counsel to remind the judge of an omission in the direction to the assessors and had this to say.
 
‘The raising of direction matters in this way is a useful function and in following it, counsel assist in achieving a fair trial. In doing so they act in their client’s interest. The appellate courts will not look favourably on cases where counsel have held their seats, hoping for an appeal point, when issues in directions should have been raised with the judge.’ 
 
 
[15] In this case the Learned High Court Judge had asked both counsel whether any re-directions were required and they had replied in the negative. 
 
 
[16] The sentences complained of in the summing up is as follows.
 
 
 ‘She admitted, she's serving time at Korovou Women's Prison, at the moment. What you make of DW1's evidence, is entirely a matter for you.'
 
 
 
 
[17] A plain reading of the sentence complained of makes it abundantly clear that the Learned High Court Judge has not said that Defence witness Siteri Gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner (emphasis mine) though the Defence counsel had informed the Judge in the absence of assessors that she was serving a prison sentence. Instead, what the Judge had said was that Siteri Gade admitted that she was serving time at the said Prison. She began her evidence at the trial by stating that 'I am currently staying at Women's Prison at Korovou.' Under cross-examination she said ' I am in Women's Prison in Korovou.'. Therefore, the Learned Judge had not said anything that may have conveyed to the assessors any inference other than what the witness herself had already conveyed in her evidence. The Learned Judge followed it up by stating 'what you make of DW1's evidence is entirely a matter for you.’  Thus, I disagree that the Learned High Court Judge had conveyed any adverse inference by the sentence aforesaid in the summing up.
 
 
[18] The Counsel for the Appellant also complained that the Learned Judge should have directed the assessors that they should disregard Siteri Gade's status in evaluating her evidence. What is the status of the witness that the Judge could possibly have requested the assessors to ignore? There was no evidence of her exact status before court vis-à-vis the prison. Had the Judge gone any further, the assessors, being laymen may have got the impression that Siteri was in fact serving a sentence as a convicted prisoner. The Judge had averted that danger by not addressing the assessors any further other than reminding them of her own evidence but adding that they were free to arrive at any conclusion upon her evidence. 
 
 
[19] Merumeru v. The State [1968] 14 FLR 177 was a case where the appellant, while serving a sentence of imprisonment, was tried for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the Deputy Controller of Prisons. The alleged offence took place in the prison and witnesses were called, both by the prosecution and for the defence, who were convicted persons serving sentences. In his summing up the trial judge told the assessors that they must give such weight as they thought appropriate to the evidence of those witnesses, but warned them that it was evidence from a source which put them on their guard and should be scrutinised with care and examined to see if it was corroborated by or consistent with other evidence which they felt able to accept. The Court of Appeal held that 
 
 
 
 "" Later he dealt individually with the evidence of the defence witnesses. It is quite clear from his own Judgment that he did not believe the two principal defence witnesses Viliame Vakarewakuila and Waisaki Madiqi and it may well be that his summing up conveyed that to the assessors. But there is nothing wrong in that, provided he left the matter to the assessors to form their own opinions, and he did that.""
 
 
[20] Therefore, I do not think that the Judge should necessarily have given a direction of the so called status of Siteri in the summing up and in my view the assessors would not have arrived at a different conclusion even if such a direction had been given. I am also of the view that lack of such a specific direction has not resulted in any miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
[21] On the other hand Siteri's evidence in material particulars corroborates the version of the complainant except on the point that she had not seen any blood stain on the bed sheet. The complainant seems to have been confronted with this evidence in cross-examination and she had replied that Siteri was lying in stating that she had collected a bed sheet without blood stain on it. Thus, given a free hand to decide upon Siteri's evidence by the Learned Judge, I am not surprised that the assessors had chosen not to place reliance on her evidence on the lack of blood stains on the bed sheet and thereby disbelieve the complainant. Accordingly appeal ground one is rejected.
 
 
Ground 2 - ‘The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the complainant and the supporting witnesses had been inconsistent and significant material evidence of the alleged bed sheet not having been tendered .’ 
 
 
[22] The Appellant firstly complains in his written submissions of three statements found in the complainant's evidence under oath which are alleged to be contradictory to her statement to the police. However, the three statements set out in the written submissions are really omissions alleged to be not found in her police statement. But, not a single of such alleged omissions had been highlighted in the cross-examination of the complainant. The police statement of the complainant had not been even referred to in her evidence. Therefore, merely because her police statement is found in the Court Record the Court of Appeal cannot peruse it and look for omissions in the complainant's evidence under oath. The effect of such omissions or inconsistencies could be considered if the complainant had been confronted with them at the trial and allowed her the opportunity to explain, if possible. Thus, I do not find any merit in this submission. In that context the observations made in Gyan v. State [1963] 9 FLR 105 need not be considered. 
 
 
[23] Secondly, the Appellant also complained of an alleged inconsistency between the evidence of the complainant and her aunt Seini Lagakali. The complainant had said that the Appellant pushed down her forehead onto the bed, punched her thighs, and even strangled her prior to committing rape. Seini Lagakali had said that she saw her niece's face swollen and her having swollen thighs, hands and forehead. I do not think that there is any material inconsistency between these two witnesses. The evidence of these two witnesses relate to two different aspects with a time span coming in between. The complainant speaks of what was done to her while her aunt speaks of what she observed. An act and the outward manifestation of it need not be the same and exactly matching. I would not reasonably expect these two witnesses to be exact and mathematically precise with regard to the cause and effect of the Appellant's use of force on the complainant. If they are, then that would surprise me and give rise to a doubt of a total fabrication. 
 
 
[24] Even assuming for the sake of argument that there is some inconsistency between the two testimonies, when such inconsistency should not be attached with any unwarranted importance at the trial is stated succinctly in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat [1983] AIR 753, 1983 SCR (3) 280) by the Supreme Court of India where it was held inter alia 
 
 
 
 'Over much importance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies ......... Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance. More so when the all-important ""probabilities-factor"" echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses.' 
 
 
[25] I am of the view that the alleged inconsistency pointed out by the Appellant is of very minor nature and need not have been specifically pointed out when the Learned Judge had fully set out the evidence of the complainant and her aunt in verbatim in the summing up. Therefore, in my view the assessors would not have expressed any other opinion other than the one recorded even if the Judge had pointed out the so called inconsistency to them in the summing up. 
 
 
[26] The Appellant also argues that the failure on the part of the prosecution to produce the bed sheet is critical to the issue whether the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Defence witness Siteri Gade has said in evidence that she laundered the bed sheet within a day or two. Therefore, even if there had been blood stains on the bed sheet after the act of rape as claimed by the complainant they may have disappeared with the washing. The investigators do not seem to have even searched for the said bed sheet and it had not been listed as an exhibit either. Thus, the prosecution cannot be faulted for not having produced the bed sheet at the trial. The bed sheet was not an indispensible item of evidence to prove the prosecution case. The defence too had not asked the investigating officer PC 3538 Alvind Kumar anything about the bed sheet. If the bed sheet had been so critical, Siteri could have produced that herself when she gave evidence. In the circumstances, I reject the second ground of appeal too. 
 
 
Ground 3 - ‘The Learned Trial Judge erred in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the doctor was not called to confirm allegations via a medical certificate on the presence of injuries as alleged by the complainant (PW1) and her aunt (PW3).’ 
 
 
[27] According to the complainant she had been taken to CWM hospital on 26 September, i.e. the 05th day after the incident. One Dr. Tusneer Singh, his hand written statement dated 26 September and the Medical Report of the same day had been listed among the disclosures. However, the prosecution called or produced none at the trial. It cannot be denied that had medical evidence been made available at the trial it might have shed some light on the act of sexual intercourse and other injuries. What telltale signs of the acts spoken to by the complainant may have remained after five days can only be surmised at this stage. The prosecution had not explained at the trial stage as to why the medical evidence was not led. Their submission before this court is that the requirement of corroboration in law for rape cases has been removed by section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Decree (now Criminal Procedure Decree Act) and therefore medical evidence, being of corroborative nature, was not absolutely necessary to prove the case. 
 
 
[28] In Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat (supra) the Supreme 
 Court of India further said 
 
 
 'Corroboration is not the sine-quo-non for a conviction in a rape case. 
 In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury. Viewing 
 Assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to the 
 Injury. Viewing evidence of the girl or the women who complains of 
 rape or sexual molestation with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses 
 tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion, is to justify the charge of male 
 chauvinism in a male dominated society.'
 
 
[29] Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Act states that 
 
 
 ' Where any person is tried for an offence of a sexual nature, no corroboration of the complainant’s evidence shall be necessary for that person to be convicted; and in any such case the judge or magistrate shall not be required to give any warning to the assessors relating to the absence of corroboration' 
 
[30] Thus, it appears that jurisprudence elsewhere had developed without any statutory compulsion not to insist on corroboration of the victim's testimony in rape cases which has been now codified by section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Therefore, technically the position taken up by the State cannot be assailed (see also Kean v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 95 OF 2008: 13 November 2013 [2013 FJCA 117]. 
 
 
[31] However, I am of the view that the legislators would not have intended by section 129 to sanction withholding corroborative evidence, if available, from court. In other words section 129 could not have intended to deprive the court of corroborative material, if and when readily available, because both the assessors and the judge would always like to see that the evidence would not only satisfy the elements of the offence but also their conscience that not only the guilty would not go unpunished but also that the innocent would not be convicted. Thus, I believe that all what section 129 seeks to achieve is that an accused would not go scot-free merely because the complainant's evidence is not corroborated by other evidence, be it expert evidence such as medical evidence or otherwise. Section 129 is a shield protecting a truthful but uncorroborated testimony of a complainant but should not be used as a sword against an accused. 
 
 
[32] In the instant case there is no doubt that the prosecution could have led medical evidence. In fact, at the last pre-trial conference the prosecution had indicated that it would rely on the medical report too. However, in terms of law it was not a sine qua none to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt against the Appellant. The Appellant seems to be under a misapprehension that such evidence was absolutely necessary to prove the complainant's allegation of act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent. 
 
 
[33] While it is true that medical evidence in a rape case could shed light on either one or both of the said elements, surprisingly, in this case the Appellant had not challenged either of them in the cross-examination of the complainant. There was not even a suggestion to the complainant that the Appellant had not penetrated her vagina or that it happened with her consent. The act of sexual intercourse and consent or lack of it, were matters within the exclusive knowledge of only the complainant and the Appellant. The complainant had testified to both the act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent. The Appellant had not challenged her evidence in cross-examination. Neither had he testified to the contrary. The Appellant appears to have confronted the complainant only with Siteri Gade's position that the bed sheet had no blood stains only to get an answer from her that Siteri was lying. 
 
 
[34] In the circumstances, the assessors were entitled to act purely on the evidence of the complainant if they had believed her version. Though there was no medical evidence the injuries on the complainant's body to a great degree had been corroborated by her aunt's evidence whose observations of the complainant's demeanour and injuries also had gone unchallenged in the cross-examination even by way of a suggestion. Further, defence witness Siteri Gade's evidence, by and large, had corroborated the complainant's evidence. Therefore, in my view the medical evidence, if led, would not have changed their opinion. The chances are that medical evidence might have further corroborated the complainant. Therefore, in my view failure to lead medical evidence has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice. I reject the third ground of appeal. 
 
 
Ground 4 - 'That the learned judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct himself that the guilty verdicts are unreasonable based on the paucity of evidence led by prosecution at the trial.'
 
 
[35] The gist of the Appellant's complaint is that it was unreasonable for the Learned Judge to have accepted the complainant's evidence on penile penetration without medical evidence. According to his submissions, the testimony of the complainant on oath which he has termed as hearsay evidence is not enough to prove the fact of penetration beyond reasonable doubt and medical evidence is the only credible evidence to prove penetration. Thus, the Appellant argues that the trial Judge had erred in law and in fact in affirming the guilty verdict of the assessors without weighing the entirety of evidence before him at the trial. He also has submitted that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence resulting in gross miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
 [36] The Learned Judge in his judgment has stated inter alia that he had reviewed the evidence, directed himself in accordance with the summing up, and held that the assessors' verdict was not perverse and it was open to them to reach the conclusion they had reached on the evidence. Accordingly he had accepted the assessors' verdict.
 
[37] The Appellant relies on Ram v. State Criminal Appeal No. CAV0001 of 2011: 09 May 2012 [2012 FJSC 12] to argue that the learned Judge should have independently assessed the evidence for him to satisfy that the ultimate verdict is supported by evidence and is not perverse. However, in Kaiyum v  State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0071/2012: 14 March 2014 [2014 FJCA 35] the Court of Appeal held otherwise on the basis that the above statement in Ram was obiter dicta and the Supreme Court had approved on other occasions the practice of the trial Judge writing a short judgment confirming with the assessors' opinion in compliance with section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009 in the following terms. 
 
'While we accept that in Ram the Supreme Court did  state  that an independent analysis of evidence by the trial judge was necessary to ensure the verdict is supported by evidence, the remark is only an obiter dicta. We say this because the remark was made in the course of formulating the test when a guilty verdict is challenged on the basis that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence ( see, section 23 (1) (a) of the Court of Appeal Act). In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court has clarified that where the trial judge agrees with the opinions rendered by the assessors, section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Decree does not require the trial judge to carry out an independent analysis of evidence before pronouncing judgment. But the Supreme Court has endorsed that ""a short written judgment, even where conforming with the assessors' opinions is a sound practice"" (State v Miller (unreported CAV 8 of 2009; 15 April 2011, Mohammed v State (unreported CAV 2 of 2013; 27 February 2014)'
 
 
 
 
[38] Therefore, I do not think that the complaint of the Appellant on this score is sustainable. 
 
 
[39] His complaint of lack of medical evidence has already been dealt with in some detail earlier. The Appellant seems to think that the complainant's evidence in regard to the act of sexual intercourse and want of consent is hearsay evidence. This is a complete misconception. Her evidence is direct and the best evidence on both elements. Her aunt's recent complaint evidence corroborates the complainant's evidence on the effects of use of force by the Appellant. Medical evidence is only of corroborative value. No medical evidence taken alone could prove a case of rape except in a rare and exceptional case where for example the complainant is dead. 
 
 
[40] If the Appellant had considered the medical evidence to be so crucial he could have called the doctor as part of his defence. At the end of the prosecution case he conceded that there was a case to answer which means that he thought that there was at least a prima facie case placed by the prosecution before court even without the medical evidence both on the act of rape and lack of consent, the two ingredients of the offence he was charged with. He did not answer the prosecution case with regard to those two matters. Apart from the complainant only the Appellant could have testified to one or both of the critical elements of the offence in the affirmative or negative. Neither did he call his friend Dike Manasa but only called Siteri Gade, friend's wife. Siteri's evidence does not constitute a frontal attack on the complainant's evidence on the act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent. On the contrary, in general even Siteri corroborates the complainant's version of events that took place in Siteri's house. 
 
 
[41] The Appellant relies on the case of Kaiyum in support of his argument that in the absence of medical evidence the case against him had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. In Kaiyam one of the complaints of the Appellant was on the inadequacy of the medical evidence led by the prosecution and the court had found that the inadequacy could be explained having regard to the other evidence and held that no criticism can be made regarding the medical evidence in that case. Thus, Kaiyum is not an authority to the Appellant's proposition that no rape could be proved without medical evidence. On the other hand Kaiyum has not considered section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009. In terms of section 129 no prosecution in respect of an offence of a sexual nature should fail for lack of corroboration of the complainant's evidence provided her testimony could be relied upon. It further states that no direction on the absence of such corroboration is also required. Thus, even the judge need not necessarily direct himself or herself on the lack of medical evidence being corroborative material in a case of rape in his judgment. 
 
 
[42] I have carefully examined the entirety of evidence led in this case and I cannot help but feel that the Appellant had taken advantage of the complainant who had trusted him to the extent that she thought that her relationship with him was 'unbreakable'. She is described as a humble and quiet person who would not talk back even when in disagreement. To his detriment, the Appellant appears to have been under the impression that because the complainant was his girlfriend he had an open licence to have sexual intercourse with her even against her consent. I am certain that the Appellant knew very well that when he penetrated her vagina, he was doing it against her will because by that time she had finally given up her resistance having been overpowered by the Appellant's superior physical strength and rough tactics. The Appellant had simply betrayed her. 
 
 
[43] Analysing the evidence of the prosecution carefully, I find that the victim’s testimony has stood the test of probability, consistency, lack of contradictions, promptness and been enhanced by the corroboration in the form of the observations made by her aunt. It may also be mentioned, as a passing remark, that there is no apparent motive for the victim to have falsely implicated the Appellant for having committed rape. I have no doubt that on evidence the case against the Appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
 
 
[44] In Rajinder Raju v. State of H. P. Criminal Appeal No. 670 of 2003 decided on 07.07.2009, R.M. Lodha, J. speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of India said 
 
 
 ‘a woman - victim of sexual aggression - would rather suffer silently than to falsely implicate somebody. Any statement of rape is an extremely humiliating experience for a woman....; she would not blame anyone but the real culprit. While appreciating the evidence of the prosecutrix, the Courts must always keep in mind that no self-respecting woman would put her honour at stake by falsely alleging commission of rape on her.’ 
 
 
[45] When a verdict is challenged on the basis that it is unreasonable, the test is whether the trial judge could have reasonably convicted on the evidence before him (vide Ram and Kaiyum). In my view neither the opinion of the assessors nor the verdict of the Learned Judge could be considered as unreasonable. I think having regard to the evidence led the Appellant could have been convicted of the charge levelled against him and therefore the verdict of guilt against the Appellant could be supported. I would follow Ram where the Supreme Court held that 'an appellate court will not set aside a verdict of a lower court unless the verdict is unsafe and dangerous having regard to the totality of evidence in the case'. Thus, the forth ground of appeal is rejected. 
 
 
Ground on sentence 'The Learned Judge erred in law when he failed to discount the appellant's period in remand separately from the mitigating factors.'
 
 
[46] The Learned High Court Judge had considered the Appellant's period of remand, i.e. 01 year and 08 months under mitigating factors along with the fact that the Appellant had committed a sex offence for the first time, though having 07 previous convictions and given a reduction of 04 years for both under mitigating factors. 
 
 
[47] Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009 states that 
 
 
 
 'If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.'
 
 
 [48] In Sowane v. State CAV 0038 of 2015: 21 April 2016 [2016 FJSC 8] the Supreme Court, following Basa v State AAU0024 of 2005: 24 March 2006 [2006 FJCA 23] approved the practice of arriving at the head sentence after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors as it 'has the advantages of simplicity and clarity' and thereafter regard any period of remand already served by the Appellant and give a substantial allowance for that period. Such reduction need not be the exact days or even weeks spent on remand. 
[49] The Court of Appeal in Domona  v  State AAU 0039 of 2013: 30 September 2016   [2016 FJCA 110] following Sowane said that in future the time spent in remand must not be considered as a mitigating factor and it should be considered separately as stipulated by law. I couldn't agree more. Giving reasonable and substantial allowance to the period of custody after the final sentence is arrived to determine the head sentence brings clarity and transparency to the sentencing process apart from being compliant with section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009. 
[50] Therefore, it is clear that the Learned Judge should have considered the Appellant's period of remand after arriving at the final sentence. However, both Sowane and Domona were decided in the year 2016 and the trial Judge did not have the benefit of them when he decided the Appellant's case in the year 2013. Nevertheless, there is merit in the Appellant's complaint. 
 
[51] Now the question is how this Court should approach the Appellant's complaint. In Ananda Abey Raj v. The State CAV 0003 of 2014: 20 August 2014 [2014 FJSC 12] while approving the decision in Naisua v. State Crim. App. No. CAV 0010 of 2013: 20 November 2013 ([2013] FJSC 14], the Supreme Court reiterated that the Appellate Courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
 
 (i) Acted upon a wrong principle
 (ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 (iii) Mistook the facts;
 (iv) Failed to take into account some relevant considerations.
 

[52] In Kasim v State Criminal Appeal No.AAU 0021 of 1993: 27 May 1994 ([1994] FJCA 25) the Court of Appeal said: 
 
 
 ‘We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point’ 
 
 
[53] In Drotini v. The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0001 of 2005S: 2006 24 March 2006 ([2006] FJCA 26) the Court of Appeal, though not having ventured into altering the starting point, suggested in Kasim said: 
 
 
‘The continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in the levels of sentence ordered in rape cases by the courts in Fiji. We endorse this trend.’ 
 
 
[54] It is clear that the trial Judge has started the usual sentencing process with 07 years imprisonment which is the lowest point of the tariff for adult rape cases going up to 15 years. In Koroivuki v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0018 of 2010: 05 March 2013 [2013 FJCA 15] it was held that as a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. In this regard the Appellant has got the maximum allowance. The trial Judge has reduced 04 years for the first offence and period of remand under mitigating factors. I am certain that if not for the remand period the trial Judge would not have deducted 04 years for the Appellant being found guilty of a sex offence for the first time under mitigating factors. 
 
 
[55] I would like to remind myself of the following words of wisdom also in dealing with this ground of appeal. Dr. Anand J. on behalf of the Supreme Court of India said in The State of Punjab vs Gurmit Singh & others 1996 AIR 1393, 1996 SCC (2) 384. 
 
 
‘We must remember that a rapist not only violates the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault - it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim; a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female.’ 
 
 
‘Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase.’
 
 
 [56] In Lokesh Mishra v. State of NCT Delhi CRL. A. 768/2010 decided on 12 March 2014 by the High Court of Delhi, Kailash Gambhir, J. said 
 
 ‘It is appalling to see that rape rears its ugly facade almost every day. 'Rape' is one such dark reality ............ that devastates a women's soul, shatters her self-respect, and for a few, purges their hope to live. It shakes the insight of a woman who once was a 'happy person', and had no clue of being a victim of the said horrifying and nightmarish encounters...” 
 
 
 [57] In Ananda Abey Raj , the Chief Justice quoted the following remarks made in State v AV [2009] FJHC 24: HAC 192.2008: 21 February 2009 
 ‘Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault ...... Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.’ 
[58] In Koroicakau v The State Criminal Appeal No. CA0006 of 2005S decided on 04 May 2006; [2006] FJSC 5 the Supreme Court observed 
'When a sentence is reviewed on appeal, again it is the ultimate sentence rather than each step in the reasoning process that must be considered. Different judges may start from slightly different starting points and give somewhat different weight to particular facts of aggravation or mitigation, yet still arrive at or close to the same sentence.' 
 
[59] Saleem Marsoof J., in the Supreme Court said in Quari v State Criminal Petition No. CAV 24 of 2014: 20 August 2015 [2015 FJSC 15]:
 
 “In my considered view, it is precisely because of the complexity of the sentencing process and the variability of the circumstances of each case that judges are given by the Sentencing and Penalties Decree a broad discretion to determine sentence. In most instances there is no single correct penalty but a range within which a sentence may be regarded as appropriate, hence mathematical precision is not insisted upon. But this does not mean that proportionality, a mathematical concept, has no role to play in determining an appropriate sentence.”
 
 
[60] The ultimate object of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 coupled with the judicial guidelines is to help judges arrive at a just and fair sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence for an accused considering all the circumstances of the case while maintaining an acceptable degree of uniformity and consistency. It is not to insist on a straightjacket approach to sentencing. Mathematical accuracy is not what is expected in sentencing (see Bijendra v State Criminal Appeal No, AAU 0056 of 2013: 30 September 2016 [2016 FJCA 111], Turogo v State Criminal Appeal No, AAU 0008 of 2013: 30 September 2016 [2016 FJCA 117], Matasavui v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0036 of 2013: 30 September 2016 [2016 FJCA 118]).
 
 
[61] I have revisited all the circumstances of the case and feel that the Appellant may have been somewhat lucky to have escaped with a sentence of 08 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 06 years. The last person who the complainant thought, would rape her would have been her boyfriend, the Appellant who should have been her protector and guardian. Therefore, I am convinced that the ultimate sentence of 08 years imprisonment should not be disturbed as it meets the ends of justice. 
 
 
 [62] In a somewhat similar case Rainima  v  State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0022 of 2012: 27 February 2015  [2015 FJCA 17] the Court of Appeal said as follows:
'Similarly, the trial judge has taken into account the remand period of the appellant also as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence....the deduction of 5 years for the offence of rape in this case can be reasonably accounted for the time spent in remand, the guilty plea and the good behavior (good character) of the appellant... I am of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial court is lawful and this court should not intervene with it. Therefore, pursuant to section 23(3) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. 12, the appeal is dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial Judge is affirmed.'
 
 
[63] Therefore, considering all the circumstances of the case I am not inclined to interfere with the sentence imposed on the Appellant. I think the sentence of 08 years imprisonment with a minimum period of 06 years to be served before the Appellant becoming eligible for parole is fully justified. The sentence is not excessive. There are no exceptional circumstances for this Court to revise it. The sentence has not caused any substantial miscarriage of justice to the Appellant and therefore, I reject the ground of appeal on sentence.
 
 
[64] Therefore, I conclude that the appeal should stand dismissed and the conviction and sentence be affirmed. 
 
 
Perera, JA 
 
 
[65] I have read in draft the judgment of Prematilaka JA and I agree with His Lordship’s reasons and conclusion.
 
 
The Orders of the Court are:
  
• Appeal is dismissed.
 
• Conviction and Sentence are affirmed.

The Complainant is Appellant’s granddaughter. She was 12 years old at the time of the incident. On the 04th February 2015, she was staying at Appellant’s place. When she was lying down on a bed Appellant came and sat beside her. Appellant put his hand inside her top and touched her breasts. Then he touched her private parts on top of her cloths. Appellant asked her how she feels when he touched her breasts. The Complainant started crying and she informed her sister about the incident. Later they informed about the incident to their father and the matter was reported to the Police. 
 
 
6. GROUNDS OF APPEAL

• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself to the significance of prosecution witnesses conflicting evidence during the trial;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into adequate consideration the evidence if all the defence witnesses in deciding that the Appellant was guilty of the offence charged.

ANALYSIS
 
 
 Ground 1 
 
 
Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the evidence if the complainant/witness who were juveniles and as such proper direction ought to have been given regarding taking oath;
 
  
• At the trial, Prosecution called two witnesses, the victim (12) and her sister (11) both of whom were children within the meaning of the Juveniles Act at the time they gave evidence. 
 
 
• As per the record, both child witnesses gave sworn evidence. The trial Magistrate, before proceeding to record their evidence under oath, did not hold a competency test to ascertain whether the child witnesses understood the nature and solemnity of the oath. 
 
 
• The Counsel for Appellant submits that the trial Magistrate did not comply with Section 10 (1) of the Juveniles Act and fell into error when he found the Appellant guilty on evidence of child witnesses whose evidence was not tested against competency. 
 
 
• Section 10 (1) of the Juveniles Act provides as follows:
 

“Where in any proceedings against any person for any offence or in any civil proceedings any child of tender years called as a witness does not in the opinion of the court understand the nature of an oath, his evidence may proceed not on oath, if, in the opinion of the court, he is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth; and the evidence though not given on oath but otherwise taken and reduced into writing so as to comply with any law in force for the time being, shall be deemed to be a deposition within the meaning of any law so in force:
 
 
Provided that where evidence is admitted by virtue of this section on behalf of the prosecution, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless that evidence is corroborated.
 
  
• There is a requirement under Section 10, that a child witness of tender years should be subjected to a competence inquiry where he or she is required to demonstrate an understanding of the nature and solemnity of an oath. The oath test required children to express knowledge of the fact that they would be committing a sin and ""burn in the fires of hell"" if they lied on oath (R v Brasier (1779) 168 Eng. Rep. 202 (K.B.). 
 
 
• If the child witness passes the oath test, he is competent to give sworn evidence, but his or her evidence is still subjected to the common law warning of corroboration. If the child witness fails the competency test, the trial court can record unsworn ‘evidence’ if it was satisfied that the child witness possessed sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of evidence and understood the duty of speaking the truth. However, the accused is not liable to be convicted on unsworn evidence unless that evidence is corroborated.
 
• The effects of section 10 were clearly explained by Shameem J in Agnu v  State  unreported Criminal Appeal No. HAA067 of 2008; 5 September 2008 at p5:
 

""The law on the evidence of children is that where a child gives unsworn evidence, corroboration is required as a matter of law. That means that without corroboration, a conviction is impossible. Where however a child gives sworn evidence, a corroboration warning should be given as a matter of practice on the basis that the evidence of children may be unreliable without some supporting evidence independent of the child and implicating the accused"".
 
  
• A careful examination of case law in Fiji would indicate that up until the landmark judgment of State v. AV [2009] FJHC 18; HAC192.2008 (2 February 2009), the courts in Fiji had strictly applied the rules of evidence concerning children of tender years as was provided in Section 10 of the Juveniles Act and the failure to hold an inquiry into the competency of a child witness had resulted in the conviction being quashed (Lal Khan (1981) 73 Cr App R 190, Fazal Mohammed v the State (1990) 91 Cr App R 256, C. A. Z. (1990) 91 Cr App R 203, Suresh Chand v R Ltk Cr App No. 77/83, Kepueli Jitoko v the State [1991] 37 FLR 14, Mohammed Salim Nur Khan v The State Cr App No. HAA004 of 2008). 
 
 
• The High Court in AV (supra), held that section 10 of the Juveniles Act, Cap. 56 and the common law requirement for corroboration and competency test for child witnesses unfairly discriminated against children on the ground of age and deprived them equality before the law as guaranteed by the Constitution Amendment Act 1997 (the 1997 Constitution). Therefore, the Court considered Section 10 of the Juveniles Act as ‘stricken from the said Act’. 
 
 
• In AV (supra), the victim was called to give evidence at the magistracy. Before receiving her evidence, the trial Magistrate did not carry out a competency inquiry as was required by Section 10 of the Juveniles Act Cap. 56. The trial Magistrate believed the victim's evidence and convicted the offender. The case was then transferred to the High Court for sentence. The High Court confirmed the correctness of the conviction and sentenced the offender. 
 
 
• The same issue arose before the Court of Appeal in the case of Kumar v State [2015] FJCA 32; AAU0049.2012 (4 March 2015), which was decided under the present Constitution where a similar equality provision has been incorporated. Section 26(1) of the Constitution states:
 

""Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection, treatment and benefit of the law"".
 
  
• Endorsing the sentiments expressed in AV (supra), and having analyzed the case law in England and Canada, the Court of Appeal (Gounder JA) observed: 
 

We endorse the above remarks. Every child in Fiji now has a constitutional right to be protected from abuse or any form of violence. This right is expressly provided by section 41 (1) (d) of the Constitution. Rape is the worst kind of sexual abuse that can be inflicted on a child. The courts have a constitutional duty to protect the children from any form of sexual abuse by taking into consideration matters that are in their best interests. Section 41 (2) of the Constitution states:
 
 
""The best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child."" 
 
...In our judgment, any law that restricts child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization cannot be regarded as being in the child's best interests and is inconsistent with the children's right to equality before the law. There is a growing recognition that child sexual abuse is often perpetrated by family members, close family friends or trusted community figures. In these circumstances, corroboration, that is, independent evidence implicating the accused to the alleged sexual abuse will rarely exist. The competency inquiry and the requirement for corroboration for child witnesses have no legitimate purpose in criminal proceedings involving children as victims of sexual abuse. Both the competency inquiry and requirement for corroboration for child witnesses in criminal proceedings are invalid under section 2(2) of the Constitution” 
 
  
• The object of this interpretation was to apply to children the ordinary test of competence regardless of any real or notional additional test previously imposed on them if they gave sworn or unsworn evidence, such as a requirement to determine whether the child understands nature and solemnity of the oath and the special importance of telling the truth in a court in addition to his or her duty to do so as part of normal social conduct.
 
 
• However in Kumar (supra), Calanchini P, had some reservations about the need to give corroboration warning. His Lordship acknowledged that evidence of the child witness did not have to be corroborated, but he said that a warning about the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child should still be required if the child does not understand the nature of the oath. Calanchini P concluded his judgment by saying that “children, especially young children, are still young children with all the frailties that are associated with childhood”.
 
• The Supreme Court in Kumar v State [2016] FJSC 44; CAV0024.2016 (27 October 2016) held that the requirement in Section 10 of the Juveniles Act that unsworn evidence of a child witness has to be corroborated is unconstitutional and therefor invalid. 
 

22. It was further observed: 
 
 
“In other jurisdictions, a child’s evidence is given unsworn. That has been the position in England in respect of children under the age of 14 since 1988: see section 33A (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. That recognizes that the form in which the evidence is given is far less important than the child’s ability to understand the questions they are being asked, to give answers which can be understood, and to appreciate the need to tell the truth. Giving evidence in court can be an intimidating experience even for adults, and requiring a child to take the oath could serve to increase their discomfort. In my opinion, therefore, it is far more appropriate for a child to give evidence unsworn, and for the distinction in section 10(1) of the Juveniles Act between the sworn and unsworn evidence of a child to be abolished, as has occurred in England”
 
  
• Of the requirement to conduct a “competence inquiry”, the Supreme Court observed: 
 

“The same applies to the existing requirement for a judge to conduct a “competence inquiry” before the child gives evidence to ascertain whether, to use the language of section 10(1), the child “is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth”.
 
In my opinion, the more appropriate course is to follow what has been the practice in England for almost 30 years, and to leave it to the judge to decide whether to conduct a “competence inquiry” before the child gives evidence, and for the requirement in section 10(1) of the Juveniles Act that the judge must do so to be abolished, although again I can only give effect to that view if that requirement is inconsistent with the Constitution.
 
  
• Of the requirement of giving corroboration warning, the Supreme Court observed: 
 

The same also applies, albeit with one refinement, to the warning to the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child...
 
...The more appropriate course is to follow what again has been the practice in England for almost 30 years, and for the requirement at common law for the judge to warn the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child to be abolished.
 
  
• The Supreme Court was not prepared to accept the proposition that the practice to give corroboration warning and the obligation to hold a competence inquiry discriminated against children. The Court observed:
 

“It also follows that I am in respectful disagreement with Goundar JA’s judgment in the Court of Appeal that the “competence inquiry” which the judge is required by section 10(1) to conduct before a child can give evidence, and the requirement at common law for a warning of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child, are inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid. However, whether the requirement for a warning of this kind should remain part of the common law is another matter. For the reasons given in [33] above, I believe that Fiji should follow the path taken in England many years ago, and treat that requirement as no longer representing part of our common law. Accordingly, the fact that the trial judge did not give the assessors that warning does not undermine Kumar’s conviction. Having said that, there may be some cases in which the trial judge thinks that a warning of this kind is desirable. That may have something to do with the nature of the child’s evidence, or the way it was given, or it may have something to do with the assessors themselves. The trial judge is in the best position to assess that. So although there should no longer be any requirement on trial judges to give a warning of this kind, they may do so if they think that it is appropriate in a particular case... 
 
 
 ...The same is true of the inquiry which the judge is required to conduct to determine, before the child gives evidence, whether the child can give unsworn evidence, namely whether the child “is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth”. I do not see how such a requirement discriminates against children. Whether the witness is a child or an adult, the judge always has to assess the witness’ competence to give evidence. A child may not be mature enough to give evidence, in just the same way as an adult may have a mental disorder which makes him incompetent as a witness. So the need for the judge to determine whether a particular witness understands the questions they are asked, or is able to answer those questions in a way which can be understood, or appreciates the need to tell the truth, applies just as much to adults as it does to children. Section 10(1) does no more than to emphasize the need for that when the witness is a child.
 
  
• However, the Supreme Court did not disagree with the proposition that a requirement in any law restricting child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization is in conflict with the child’s best interests.
 
 
• Gounder JA in AV (supra) referred to rights which the Constitution affords to children. His Lordship referred to Article 41(1) (d) of the Constitution which affirms the right of every child to be protected from abuse and also to Article 41 (2) of the Constitution which states ""The best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child."" 

28. The Supreme Court in Kumar (supra) concluded: 
 
“that the trial judge should have determined before the child witness gave evidence whether he or she could give sworn evidence. If he had decided that she could not, he should then have determined whether she could give unsworn evidence”. 
 
However, failure to do those things does not mean that the conviction of the defendant has to be quashed. (emphasis added)
 
29. In its concluding remarks, the Supreme Court observed:
 
As Goundar J noted in both his judgment in AV at [19] and in his judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case at [22], there have been many cases in which the failure of the judge to inquire into the competency of the child to give evidence, whether sworn or unsworn, has resulted in the conviction being quashed. With some diffidence, I question this line of authority – at any rate in its application to this case. I do not believe that the assessors were less likely to accept the girl’s evidence if it had been unsworn than if it had been sworn. And if it had been apparent to the trial judge in the course of the girl’s evidence that she did not satisfy the conditions for giving even unsworn evidence, he would have directed the assessors to disregard her evidence. The fact that he did not do that means that he must have thought that she was intelligent enough to understand that she had to tell the truth. In the circumstances, despite the trial judge not having done what section 10(1) required him to do, no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred (emphasis added)
 
  
• In the present case the child witnesses were 12 and 11 years of age. Once the witnesses had begun to testify, the trial Magistrate would have made them incompetent witnesses if they appeared to him to be of unsound mind, incoherent or lacking communication skills. The trial Magistrate did not do that. He, having carefully listened to the evidence, appears to have proceeded on the assumption (a fair assumption in the light of the trial magistrate’s decision to allow the girls to be sworn) that the witnesses had sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the oath. 
 
 
• I am of the view that the failure on the part of the Magistrate to hold the competence inquiry at the beginning of child witnesses’ testimony did not prejudice the Appellant. 
 
 
• Two child witnesses in this case gave evidence under oath. Therefore, question of giving corroboration warning arises only if that requirement is still valid in Common law. The Common law rule that evidence of child witness (whether sworn or unsworn) need to be corroborated has now been abolished.
 
 
• However, if the trial Magistrate had formed the view that child witnesses were not possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of their evidence and that they did not understand the duty of speaking the truth then the law predates AV judgment required, as a matter of law, evidence of the victim to be corroborated if the witnesses gave unsworn evidence. 
 
 
• Corroboration is evidence independent of the witness to be corroborated which confirms in some material particular not only that the crime was committed but that the accused committed it (R v Baskerville (1910) 2 KB 658).
 
 
• In the present case, the victim was in fact corroborated in material particular by her sister. Victim’s sister said that she was playing outside with her small sister and when she was crossing a room inside the house she saw the grandfather (Appellant) touching her sister’s private parts and asking if she liked it. She said that she saw her sister crying. Therefore, assuming that common law requirement to give corroboration warning with regard to sworn evidence as enunciated in Agnu v  State (supra) is still applicable, failure to conduct the competency test did not prejudice the Appellant because the child victim was corroborated in material particular. Therefor, even if the the obligation on the Magistrate to be satisfied at the beginning that the child had the necessary capacity to give evidence is still valid in Fiji, the trial Magistrate did not fell into error because child victim’s evidence was corroborated by her sister on material particular. 
 
 
• In the case of State v A.V (supra) the learned High Court Judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness, the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has, is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence.
 
 
• The Court of Appeal in Chand v State [2016] FJCA 20; AAU065.2011 (26 February 2016) held that the obligation on the part of the magistrate or the judge to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence would amount to a violation of section 26(1) of the Constitution: (at paragraph 15 to 19) 
 

“Counsel for the Appellant had sought to place reliance on the High Court case of The State v A.V, [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192 of 2008 (21 February 2009) which he states was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in the case of Rahul Ravinesh Kumar v The State; Criminal Appeal No AAU0049 of 2012. In the case of The State v A.V the learned High Court Judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness, the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has, is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence. I have examined this decision and find this had been stated by way of obiter. This undoubtedly is a good practice but it cannot be said that the failure to do so was fatal to the conviction of the Appellant. To hold otherwise would amount to a violation of section 26(1) of the Constitution, which states: ""Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law"". Section 26(3) of the Constitution prohibits unfair discrimination against a person directly or indirectly on the ground of age. Section 26(7) of the Constitution states treating one person differently from another on any of the grounds prescribed under subsection (3) is discrimination, unless it can be established that the difference in treatment is not unfair in the circumstances. Section 26(8) prescribes circumstances under which the right to equality and freedom from discrimination can be derogated but none of those circumstances apply to the evidence of children of tender years.
 
  
• In light of this Judgment, failure on the part of the trial Magistrate to remind the child witnesses of their duty to tell the truth is not a fatal irregularity. 
 
 
• I am of the view that the Appellant was accorded due process before he was convicted on the child witness’s valid testimony. I conclude that the trial Magistrate's decision to disregard section 10 of the Juveniles Act is in the best interest of the child guaranteed under the Constitution. This ground of appeal therefore should fail.
 

 Ground 2
 
  
• According to the Court Copy Record at page 23 and 24, as soon as the prosecution case was closed, Counsel for the Appellant informed court that she wished to summon the mother of the complainant to give evidence. By saying this, she appears to have accepted that there was a case to answer on the available evidence. Hence she did not make an application or submission in support of ‘no case to answer’. Appellant cannot complain now that he was not given the opportunity to make an application for no case to answer or any submission in its support.
 
 
• There was no submission made by the Appellant on no case to answer at the end of the prosecution case. Therefore, the claim that the learned Magistrate failed to consider her submission on no case to answer does not hold water. 
 
• Moreover, Sections 178 and 179 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 clearly state that the court has to determine the evidence at the end of prosecution case and then inform the accused of his rights after reading the charge to him again.
 

43. Relevant part of Sections 178 and 179 read as follows:
 
178. If at the close of the evidence in support of the charge it appears to the court that a case is not made out against the accused person sufficiently to require him or her to make a defence, the court shall dismiss the case and shall acquit the accused. 

 
179 (1) At the close of the evidence in support of the charge, if it appears to the court that a case is made out against the accused person sufficiently to require the making of a defence, the court shall .......
 
  
• The test applicable in the Magistrates Court is whether, taken at its highest, a reasonable court could convict on the Prosecution case. At the close of the prosecution case, there was ample evidence before court against the Appellant sufficient a reasonable court could convict on the Prosecution case. Therefore, trial Magistrate’s decision to read out the charge and put the Appellant to his defence did not violate the procedural requirement of the law. 
 

Ground 3 & 9
 
  
• There is no submission before this court of what is the ‘serious doubt’ as was claimed by the Appellant. Nor is there any submission before this court to be considered that prosecution witnesses gave conflicting evidence during the trial. I considered the evidence given by two prosecution witnesses and found no material contradiction sufficient enough to discredit the version of the Prosecution. These grounds are incomplete and not substantiated by the Appellant.
 
 
• In any event, the learned trial Magistrate has quite clearly said in his Judgment that the prosecution case was consistent and reliable as compared to the defence witnesses who were inconsistent. There is no merit in these grounds. 
 

 Ground 4
 
  
• At paragraph 4 of the Judgment, the learned Magistrate set out that it is the prosecution’s duty to prove the offence against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no basis for the claim of the Appellant that the learned Magistrate did not direct himself to the law on burden of proof.
 
 
• The Appellant submits that by stating that “the defence could not challenge the evidence given by the Prosecution...” the learned Magistrate shifted the burden to the defence to prove his innocence. I do not find any basis for this submission. 
 
 
• Trial Magistrate at the close of the prosecution case only had the prosecution version and therefore one side of the story. Upon being satisfied that there is a case to answer, the court is required to give an opportunity to the accused to tell his side of the story and also attack the credibility of the version of the Prosecution. In the process of evaluating evidence of the defence, the court is required to assess the credibility of the evidence adduced by the defence. 
 
 
• In this case, the learned Trial Magistrate stated with the words highlighted by the Appellant that evidence adduced by the defence did not damage the prosecution case or challenge the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. Ultimately, the court accepted that Prosecution has proved the offence beyond reasonable doubt. This ground has no merit and should be dismissed. 
 

Grounds 5, 6, 7 & 10
 
 
  
• These grounds are misconceived and have no basis. The Trial Magistrate in his judgment has clearly narrated in individual paragraphs the evidence of all the defence witnesses.
 
 
• Furthermore, the trial Magistrate then analyzed the defence evidence and came to the conclusion that he does not accept the defence version. He also provided reasons for doing so.
 
 
• I find the evidence of the Appellant self serving. Witnesses called by the Defence contradicted each other. The learned trial Magistrate has highlighted those contradictions and has given due consideration to inconsistencies when he decided to disbelieve the version of the Defence.
 

Ground 8 
 
  
• Appellant contends that the learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give proper weight as to when the date of the complaint was made by the complainant against the Appellant and to say “that it appears the witnesses have given their statements to the police soon after the incident” raised serious doubt in the prosecution case.
 
 
• Counsel for Appellant submits that the Prosecution did not have evidence of the date of the alleged offence and learned Magistrate’s above mentioned statement is mere speculation. 
 
 
• Prosecution has led evidence of the complainant on the basis that the alleged incident occurred between the 2nd day of February and 4th February 2015. (Page 17 of the copy record) The Defence Counsel has cross examined the complainant on the basis that the incident occurred on the 2nd day of February 2015. When the sister of the Complainant (Aaliya) was giving evidence the Defence Counsel cross examined her on the basis that she made her statement to police on 3rd day of February 2015. Therefore, there was concrete evidence before the trial Magistrate that the complaint was made soon after the incident. There is no basis for this ground and therefore should fail.

 
APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• First two grounds have been advanced on the basis that the sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principal. Therefore, grounds 1 and 2 can be considered together.
 
 
• This Court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2].  
 
 
• In Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999) the Fiji Appeal Court observed:
 

“It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499)”.
 
  
• The Supreme Court, in Naisua v State [2013] FJSC 14; CAV0010.2013 (20 November 2013), endorsed the views expressed in Bae (supra):
 

“It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
 
 (i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
(iii) Mistook the facts;
 
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration. 
 
  
• The Fiji Court of Appeal in Sharma v State [unreported Cr. App. No. AAU0065 of 2012; 2 June 2014] discussed the approach to be taken when exercising appellate jurisdiction in reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court. The Court observed: 
 

“In determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this Court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge. The approach taken by this Court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or, in other words, that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range. It follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the Court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range. However, it must be recalled that the test is not whether the Judges of this Court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence. It must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust”
 
  
• Tariff for indecent assault was set out in Rakota v State [2002] FJHC 168; HAA0068J.2002S (23 August 2002).

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.
 
These are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff, although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate. A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.
  
• This tariff has been accepted for the same offence under the Crimes Decree, 2009 as well. State v Mario [2014] FJHC 935; HAC 70 & 71.2013 (19 December 2014).
 
 
• The Appellant received 18 months’ imprisonment for indecently assaulting his granddaughter who was 12 years old. Considering the circumstances, especially the aggravating features such as the age gap and breach of trust, the Appellant has received a very lenient sentence.
 
 
• The Appellant claims that he was not given an opportunity to file his mitigation. However, the court copy record shows otherwise. The Appellant and his Counsel were given two opportunities to file mitigation; obviously the court cannot adjourn and wait indefinitely for the Appellant to file his mitigation. Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate gave due consideration to his old age and his clear record in his mitigation.
 
 
• As regards the 3rd ground against sentence, the Appellant has not specifically mentioned what relevant matters the sentencing Magistrate failed to take into consideration and what irrelevant matters he considered in coming to his final sentence. There are no merits in these grounds and should be dismissed.
 
 
• Sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate is neither excessive nor unreasonable. Therefore, I affirm the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. 
 
 
• For reasons given in this judgment, the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

73216,"SENTENCE

Epeli Nasau Naivalu, you were charged with murder but the assessors were of the unanimous opinion that you were not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and I concurred with their opinion and convicted you accordingly.

The deceased, your wife and the mother of your 3-year-old child, was living with you and with her sister and brother in law at Links Road, Kashmir at Lautoka in May 2003.

On the 1st May 2003 about 6.30pm she went to work at the Bollywood nightclub where she was employed. Her sister went with her and although she was also employed at that nightclub, she was not working on this particular night. Your wife was to work from 7.00pm until 1.00am the next day. By arrangement, she met her sister and bouncers from the nightclub when she finished work and they were drinking beer at the seawall. Your wife and her sister returned home at about 7.00am.

You were employed as a cook at Blue Lagoon Cruises and had fed and dressed your daughter when your wife arrived home. You were dressed only in a towel and were about to have your bath to go to work. Your wife asked for and demanded money as she said she was hungry. There was food in the house, cooked by you the previous night – chicken and cassava. Your wife was drunk. She continued to demand money and you refused saying that you only had $5.00 and you needed that for your bus fare to get to work. Your wife followed you to the bathroom and after putting your daughter down, you punched her in the face. Whilst she attempted to protect herself, you punched her and she went outside, you followed and caught her and punched her, she ran away and fell over near a drain and you punched her and kicked her. When it was apparent that she was unconscious, you put water on her face, changed her clothes and took her to the Lautoka Hospital where she unable to be revived and was pronounced dead.

Your wife was an habitual drinker of alcohol and went out or stayed out drinking 2 or 3 times a week and you cared for your child, taking her to your parents when you had to go work. Your wife spent your wages and her wages on drink and at times pledged you bank card to the moneylenders for more money.

You and your wife married in 2001 and sometime later your wife left you taking the child. You followed and this resulted in you and your wife living with her sister and the sister’s husband and child.

You are 27 years of age being the oldest of 3 sisters and a brother. Your father is an Education Officer and your mother is a schoolteacher. You were brought up as a member of the Methodist Church from a young age. You have no prior convictions and you are person of previous good character.

Your counsel in the plea in mitigation asks that the court impose a suspended sentence and he submits that such a sentence is appropriate in the circumstances taking account the provocation as found by the assessors and the court, your prior record and the punishment you have and will suffer having killed the mother of your child.

The aggravating factors in the offence you committed, is the severity of the attack on your wife and the fact that you followed and even chased her outside and continued the assault. It wasn’t merely 1 or 2 blows.

The punishment for manslaughter in this country has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Kim Nam Bae v The State – AAU0015 of 1998S where the court said:

“The task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculations. This is particularly so with manslaughter where the circumstances and the offender’s culpability can vary greatly from case to case. An appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations. In order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case, the courts must have regard to sentences imposed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence.

The cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal. It is important to bear in mind that this range covers a very wide set of varying circumstances which attract different sentences in different manslaughter cases. Each case will attract the appropriate sentence within the range depending on its own facts.”

In Sashi Kapoor Rayan v The State – Crim App. AAU0028 of 2000S the court noted that sentences for manslaughter of a serious kind range from 7 to 10 years. State Counsel submits that the circumstances of this matter cause it to fall in the middle range and I take that to be a range of 3 to 6 years.

I have been referred to several authorities by counsel but each matter must depend on its own particular facts but the resultant sentence should be within the range the authorities set.

The incidence of domestic violence offences in this country seems disproportionately high with a high degree of acceptance of violence towards women. It is incumbent on the court to clearly show that such behaviour is not acceptable in any community in the 21st century.

I am of the opinion that an appropriate starting point in this instance is 5 years imprisonment.

Accepting as I do, that you were provoked, that you are of previous good character and that from your record you are not likely to re-offend. I give you a discount of 18 months.

You have served 3 months imprisonment whilst on remand which when adjusted for remission equates to about 5 months and I give you credit for this.

As I have said, sentencing is not a mathematical calculation and taking account of all the circumstances and the facts as referred to, I sentence you to 3 years imprisonment from today.

83013,"SENTENCE

[1] On the 12h April 2010 at Tavua Magistrates’ Court, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of attempted rape. He agreed the facts and was convicted. He was represented by the Legal Aid Commission, which Commission filed a submission of mitigation in writing. The Magistrates Court transferred the matter to this Court ""for trial"" pursuant to S. 190 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009. Section 190 deals with sentence and there being no necessity for ""trial"", this Court assumes that the transfer for trial is a misnomer for sentence.

[2] The facts of the case are that in the early hours of the morning of 27 January 2010 at Nadala, Nadarivatu, the accused attempted to rape the victim a 2 year old girl sleeping in the same house. The little girl was staying with her 25 year old sister and was to sleep in the sitting room. The accused was staying in the same house, sleeping in another room. At about 4.00am the guardian woke up and noticed that the victim was not in the sitting room. She searched and heard noises coming from the accused’s room. She entered the room and found the victim lying beside the accused. She removed the victim who was crying. When changing the child’s diaper she noticed seminal fluid on the diaper and on the back of the girl. The grandmother who was also in the house confronted the accused who then fled from the village. The child was taken to Tavua Hospital and examined. A medical report discloses that there was bruising of the left labia consistent with recent blunt trauma. The pediatrician added in the report that the psychological impact of the incident will affect the victim and her family.

[3] The accused was arrested on 28th January 2010 and interviewed under caution by the Police. He said that he was doing early morning devotion when the victim entered his room. After devotion he had ""lusty feeling"" and lay down next to the victim. He started rubbing the victim’s vagina after lifting her diaper. He then rubbed his erect penis against her vagina until he ejaculated.

[4] The accused is aged 51, is married with one daughter and is normally resident in Taveuni. He is unemployed. In mitigation his Counsel submits that he was overcome by ""an inordinate and intense longing to lay with a woman"". He nevertheless acknowledges that his actions were wrong, he pleaded guilty, he has no previous convictions and Counsel prays that all of these factors should be taken into consideration.

[5] It is quite unnecessary to list what are the gravest aggravating factors imaginable. As the good Doctor says the lifelong impact that these events would have on this child and particularly when she herself reaches sexual maturity is unthinkable. To abuse the trust of his hosts by defiling an innocent baby in the house is outrageous.

The Law

[6] The maximum sentence for attempted rape is now life imprisonment. The maximum sentence for attempted rape on the 27th January 2010 was ten years. Ten years is obviously not enough for such a heinous crime however but for it being committed 4 days before the law changed, I am constrained to apply the former penalty.

[7] I take as my starting point the maximum term of ten years, for the very reason that I cannot imagine a more serious case of attempted rape than this. Credit must be given to the accused for his clear record, his remorse and most particularly for his early plea. For those factors I deduct three years. 

It is very tempting to add further years to reflect the serious aggravating features in this case. However those features are already subsumed in the starting point of ten years and it would be unfair to the accused to punish him twice fold for his deeds, no matter how odious they be.

[8] The total terms of imprisonment will be therefore seven years.

[9] To reflect the Court’s and the community’s abhorrence for such a crime, I fix a period of six years in which the accused is not eligible to be considered for parole.

[10] Thirty (30) days to appeal.

73503,"JUDGMENT
 
This is an appeal against sentence by the Appellant, who was sentenced to a total term of nine years imprisonment on 21st April 1997 for the following offences:
 
First Count
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 149 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
JOSEFA BIU on the 13th day of April 1997, at Suva in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of SELEI MELITA DELANA, without her consent.
 
Second Count
 
Statement of Offence
 
UNNATURAL OFFENCE: Contrary to Section 175(a) of the Penal Code, Act 17.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
JOSEFA BIU on the 13th day of April, 1997 at Suva in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of SELEI MELITA DELANA against the order of nature.
 
The Appellant pleaded guilty on both counts after electing Magistrate’s Court trial on 14th April 1997. He also agreed to the facts outlined by the prosecution.
 
The facts are these. On 13th April 1997, the complainant, an 11 year old primary school student was sent to the accused’s house to get cassava. The accused gave the complainant’s companion, a cousin, money to buy bread from the shop, and he asked the complainant to wash his dishes. He then called her into the house and told her to undress. He then took his own clothes off and made the complainant lie on the floor.
 
The facts then read as follows: “The accused then laid on top of the complainant and tried to push his erect penis into her vagina. The complainant struggled as she could feel the pain. The accused then closed her mouth with his hands. The accused was unable to penetrate into the complainant’s vagina, later he put his penis on the complainant’s anus. He then penetrated fully and ejaculated.”
 
The facts as further outlined by the prosecution, were that the complainant who was weeping throughout the encounter, was then told by the Appellant to wash herself. She left the house and met her cousin returning from the shop. When she arrived home, her mother asked her why she was distressed, whereupon the complainant related the incident to her. The matter was reported to the police, the complainant was medically examined and the Appellant interviewed. He admitted the offences and was charged.
 
The facts were admitted, the Appellant convicted as charged, and was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment on count 1, and 5 years imprisonment on count 2.
 
The Appellant now appeals against sentence on the ground that it was harsh and excessive. He submits that he had pleaded guilty, that he has four children, that the complainant was his niece (his sister’s daughter) and that he had been told by the police that he would receive a suspended sentence.
 
At the hearing of the appeal, State Counsel conceded that there was a difficulty with count 1. Although section 309(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code prohibits appeals against convictions on a plea of guilty, convictions may be set aside where they were not justified on the facts outlined in court (see R v. Rollafson (1969) 53 Cr. App. R. 389.
 
In this case, the prosecution said that the Appellant “was unable to penetrate into the complainant’s vagina.” The medical report tendered, shows that there was no penetration of the vagina but that it was possible that there was rectal penetration. In the sentence delivered by the learned
 
Magistrate, he said “when he could not penetrate, the accused then committed an unnatural offence on the victim.”
 
There seems to be no doubt that there was no vaginal penetration. Rape is unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl or woman without her consent. Section 183 of the Penal Code defines carnal knowledge thus:
 
“Whenever, upon the trial for any offence punishable under this Code, it may be necessary to prove carnal knowledge, it shall not be necessary to prove actual omission of seed in order to constitute a carnal knowledge, but the carnal knowledge shall be deemed complete upon proof of penetration only.”
 
Sections 149 and 183 of the Penal Code are silent on whether the prosecution must prove vaginal penetration as opposed to penetration of any other part of the body. However the common law accepts rape as vaginal rape, and the inclusion of the offence of “carnal knowledge against the order of nature” suggests that the Penal Code too, intended such a restriction on the offence of rape.
 
In any event, the prosecution clearly intended to prosecute in respect of two acts, the attempted penetration of the complainant’s vagina, and the successful anal penetration. The Appellant was certainly sentenced on that basis. Unfortunately the learned Magistrate did not take note of the fact that carnal knowledge is not proved unless penetration is proved, and that the facts said that there was no vaginal penetration. However, the facts, as agreed to, clearly established an attempted rape.
 
Section 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides:
 
“When a person is charged with an offence, he may be convicted of having attempted to commit the offence, although he was not charged with the attempt.”
 
Section 151 states:
 
“Any person who attempts to commit rape is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for seven years, with or without corporal punishment.”
 
Clearly the conviction of rape cannot stand. The facts do not disclose the offence, and the conviction is quashed.
 
The provisions of section 319(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provide that, at the hearing of an appeal, the High Court may “confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the Magistrate’s Court, or may remit the matter with the opinion of the High Court thereon to the Magistrate’s Court, or may order a new trial, or may order trial by a court of competent jurisdiction, or may make such order in the matter as it may seem just, and may by such order exercise any power which the Magistrate’s Court might have exercised.”
 
These very wide powers given to the High Court, on a criminal appeal, allow the court, in effect to substitute a finding which the magistrate’s court might have reached. In this case, it allows a substitution of a conviction of attempted rape, for the conviction of rape. The Fiji Court of Appeal exercised this power in State -v- Apolosa Rainima FCA 577/94. In that case, the accused had been tried in the High Court, on a charge of rape. The accused admitted to an attempt in the course of the
 
trial. However, the alternative opinion of a conviction of the lesser offence of attempted rape was not put to the assessors, and they returned an opinion of not guilty of rape. On an appeal by the State, the Court of Appeal held that a conviction on the accused’s own evidence, of attempted rape, was justified, set aside the acquittal and substituted a conviction for Attempted Rape. The case was remitted to the High Court for sentencing only.
 
In this appeal, the Appellant agreed to attempting to penetrate. The medical report shows bruising with fresh bleeding around the vagina, and superficial bruising. The hymen was intact. The doctor wrote in her report that: “It is possible that there was force used to have vaginal sex but there was no vaginal penetration.”
 
The legal definition of an attempt is provided by section 380 of the Penal Code. It is:
 
“When a person, intending to commit an offence, begins to put his intention into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment, and manifests his intention by some overt act, but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence, he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence. It is immaterial, except so far as regards punishment, whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence, or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will, or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention.”
 
This definition of “attempt” is comparable to the common law definition of an attempt in England before the passing of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. The test was whether an act was more than merely preparatory, and whether there was any further act on the defendant’s part remaining to be done before the completion of the crime (R -v- Eagleton (1855) Dears 515).
 
Lord Diplock in R -v- Stonehouse (1977) 2 ALL ER 909 said:
 
“The constituent elements of the inchoate crime of an attempt are a physical act by the offender sufficiently proximate to the complete offence and an intention on the part of the offender to commit the complete offence.
 
Acts that are merely preparatory to the commission of the offence are not sufficiently proximate to constitute an attempt. They do not indicate a fixed irrevocable intention to go on to commit the complete offence unless involuntarily prevented from doing so.”
 
The Court of Appeal in Apolosa Rainima (supra) accepted this to be the test for an attempt, under section 380 of the Penal Code.
 
Applying that test, the Appellant should clearly have been convicted of an attempted rape. He tried to penetrate the vagina, but was unable to do so. He then proceeded to have anal intercourse.
 
The offence being clear on the admitted facts, I therefore substitute a conviction of attempted rape for the conviction of rape on count 1.
 
I consider that section 309 allows the court to reconsider the matter of sentence. In this appeal, the Appellant has repeated the mitigation he made in the magistrate’s court, and has expressed remorse. In re-considering sentence, the High Court can impose a sentence which the Magistrate might have imposed within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s Court.
 
Sentence
 
The maximum sentence for Rape is life imprisonment. The maximum sentence for Attempted Rape is seven years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for Unnatural Offence is fourteen years imprisonment.
 
The Appellant has a number of previous convictions, some involving violence. He is a 35 year old man with four children. He said that he and his sister (the complainant’s mother) have now reconciled in the traditional way and that he had four children to look after. He expressed remorse.
 
Counsel for the State said that the complainant was an 11 year old child who had trusted her uncle, the Appellant. He said that the medical report showed that the psychological trauma of the incident might never heal, and that the public abhorred offences against children. He said that a 5 year term for the Unnatural Offence was justified because of the gravity of the offence, the need to protect children and the need to deter would-be child abusers.
 
The starting point for Rape is seven years imprisonment. The Magistrate’s Court, appear to pass sentences of five years imprisonment for rape, unless there are exceptional mitigating circumstances. They are limited, of course by jurisdiction to five years imprisonment.
 
However, given the maximum sentence for attempted rape, I consider that four years imprisonment might be a logical starting point. That point would then be increased if there was aggravating features, or reduced if there were mitigating factors.
 
Aggravating factors would be, the violence of the attempt, any relationship of particular trust between the accused and the complainant, the youth or age of the complainant (children and older women being particularly vulnerable), any disability suffered by the complainant, and any psychological trauma suffered by her.
 
Mitigating factors would be a plea of guilty, any expression of remorse, any attempt to make reparation for the harm done, and the accused’s antecedent history.
 
In this case, there were many aggravating factors. The Appellant abused his position of trust, and tried to rape his own niece. The complainant was only 11 years old. The facts outline her extreme distress while the offence was being committed. The medical report shows physical injury and severe psychological trauma. She may never recover from the latter.
 
Clearly the mitigating circumstances are less than impressive. The Appellant pleaded guilty. This saved the complainant from the additional trauma of giving evidence. He has also expressed remorse, and has reconciled with his sister. Unhappily such reconciliation cannot help the complainant in her recovery after the attempted rape.
 
Taking all these matters into account, I consider the four year term imposed by the learned Magistrate for Rape, to be more appropriate for an Attempted Rape. Although the violence of the attack, and the relationship between the Appellant and the child might have warranted a much higher term, I have given considerable discount for the plea of guilty. I also note that the Appellant has no previous convictions for acts of sexual violence. For these reasons I consider a term of four years imprisonment, appropriate on count 1, and I sentence the Appellant accordingly.
 
On count 2, I consider the sentence of five years imprisonment appropriate, although the Appellant might have received considerably more if he had been sentenced in the High Court. In Stephen Peter Jones (1991) 92 Cr. App. R. 288, the English Court of Appeal considered the appropriate sentences for sexual offending against children. In that case, the court held that the appropriate sentence for buggery with children was six years imprisonment. In Maleli Qiladrau Crim. App. No. 48/2000 Pathik J considered a sentence of 4½ years imprisonment to be appropriate for unnatural offence with a boy.
 
In the circumstances, I consider the five year term on count 2 entirely appropriate. Furthermore, looking at the totality of the sentence ( a total of nine years imprisonment) I also consider that a consecutive sentence reflects the gravity of the offending, the abhorrence that the public holds for the offences, and the public interest in passing a deterrent sentence in offences against children.
 
For these reasons, the sentences are to run consecutively.
 
The conviction on count 1 is quashed and is substituted with a conviction for Attempted Rape. The sentence of four years imprisonment is imposed on count 1. The sentence of five years remains for count 2. Both sentences are to be served consecutively.

270322,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Calanchini P:
[1] I have had the opportunity to read in draft the judgments of both Jayasuria JA and Madigan JA and agree with their reasons and their conclusion that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
 
 
Jayasuriya JA:
Introduction
 
 
[2] The appellant was charged with seven counts. In the first and the fourth counts, he was charged with Rape. Second, third and the fifth counts were for the offence of Indecent Assault and the sixth and seventh counts were for Sexual Assault.
 
 
[3] These seven counts reflect a series of incidents of sexual abuse spanning over a period of nine years. The first of these incidents had taken place between 30th April 2002 and 31st August 2002. On that occasion the Appellant had committed Rape, on the victim who was six years old. The appellant, who is the step grandfather of the victim, was forty-five years old, when he committed the first offence of rape. 
 
 
[4] The Appellant pleaded guilty to all seven counts and was convicted accordingly. 
 
 
[5] This appeal is against the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge.
 
 
[6] Following sentences were imposed on the appellant.
 
  
• Count 1- Rape 13 years imprisonment
 
• Count 2 - Indecent Assault 2 years imprisonment
 
• Count 3 - Indecent Assault 2 years imprisonment
 
• Count 4 - Rape 13 years imprisonment
 
• Count 5 - Indecent Assault 2 years imprisonment
 
• Count 6 - Sexual Assault 4 years imprisonment
 
• Count 7 - Sexual Assault 4 years imprisonment
 

[7] All these sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently, making a total sentence of 13 years imprisonment. A non–parole period of 12 years imprisonment was also ordered. 
 
 
[8] The trial judge had taken into account a series of mitigating factors as well as aggravating factors in arriving at the periods of imprisonment reflected above. 
 
 
[9] Appellant challenges the sentence on two grounds. They are:
 
  
• Remand period of 1 year and 1 month 15 days has not been deducted from the interim total as a separate factor;
 
 
• The trial judge had failed to indicate the discount given for the guilty plea.
 

FAILURE TO DEDUCT THE REMAND PERIOD
 
 
[10] It was submitted that the appellant spent 1 year 1 month and 15 days period in remand pending trial in this case. The State did not dispute this fact.
 
 
[11] The Sentencing Order of 15th March 2012 reflects that the learned trial judge had taken into account the period the appellant spent in remand as one of the mitigating factors, in arriving at the final term of imprisonment. 
 
 
[12] Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, requires a court to regard any period of time during which the offender was held in custody pending trial, as a period of imprisonment already served by an accused person. However, a court in its discretion can order otherwise.
 
 
[13] On behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that the trial judge did not satisfy this requirement as he failed to consider the time the appellant spent in custody pending trial as a separate factor and make a specific deduction equal to such period of time, in determining the term of imprisonment imposed on the appellant. 
 
 
[14] The State conceded that the trial judge should have made a separate downward adjustment to the sentence according to the time spent in custody and therefore contravened Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. 
 
 
[15] State moved this court to pass a sentence 'warranted by law' as provided under section 23(3) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap 12.
 
 
DISCOUNT FOR GUILTY PLEA
 
 
[16] The next ground urged on behalf of the Appellant is, that the trial judge failed to quantify the discount that had been given to the guilty plea but had subsumed this factor as a part of mitigation in arriving at the final term of imprisonment imposed on the appellant 
 
 
[17] The Appellant relies on Naikelekelevesi v The State; [2008]FJCA 11; AAU 0061/2007 (27 June 2008) where it was observed that: 
 
 
""where there is a guilty plea, this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factor in a case""
 
 
[18] On behalf of the State, it was submitted that the trial judge in fact had taken into account the guilty plea and its favourable consequences to the victim in determining the sentence. However, in response to a question posed by this court the counsel for the State submitted that a reduction of around 15% from the overall sentence would meet ends of justice in this case, if the reduction is to be quantified and set out as a separate factor.
 
 
DETERMINATION
 
 
[19] Sentencing of offenders is an integral and important part of the Administration of Criminal Justice process. When statutes have set out different levels of punishment to different offences, it leaves a broad discretion on a court to determine the exact type and the level of punishment that will be imposed in a given situation.
 
 
[20] Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 sets out broad guidelines on sentencing as well as specific requirements that need to be adhered to, in imposing sentences of imprisonment.
 
 
[21] Section 4 (1) of the Decree (supra) identifies inter alia following purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court:
 
  
• To punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances
 
• .............
 
• To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature,
 
• ................
 
• To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences
 
• ...........
 

[22] Section 4(2) of the Decree (supra) recognizes several factors a court must have regard to in sentencing offenders. They include: whether the offender pleaded guilty or not, the stage at which such plea was entered if he had pleaded guilty and whether the offender's conduct is an indication of remorse or lack of remorse. This section also recognizes the impact of an offence on any victim as a factor a court must give due regard to, in deciding on the sentence, in a given situation.
 
 
[23] In Khan v The State [2014] FJCA 92; AAU 105/2011 (2 June 2014) it was observed:
 
 
""the Sentencing and Penalties Decree has left it to the decision of the sentencing court to give an appropriate weight to a guilty plea when sentencing an offender""
 
 
[24] While making the above observation, the court further opined that:
 
 
""Naikelekelevesi's case was considered before the Sentencing and Penalties Decree came into effect in 2010. The Sentencing and Penalties Decree has not endorsed the Naikelekelevesi principle""
 
 
[25] The trial judge in this case had observed the following:
 
 
 (a) ""You pleaded guilty to the charges, although this was approximately 1 year 1 month after the first call in the High Court. Consequently, you have saved the court's time, and avoided the need for the complainant to relive her ordeal in the court room by giving evidence;
 
 (b) It appears you are remorseful, and as a result you have voluntarily admitted your guilt, on all the offences""
 

[26] The trial judge had taken these factors relating to the 'guilty plea' into his account in determining the sentence, despite he has 'subsumed' these factors among the other factors that were considered as mitigating factors.
 
 
[27] Similarly, the trial judge has taken into account the remand period of the appellant also as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence.
 
 
[28] Therefore, the issues this court in exercising its appellate jurisdiction, has to resolve are, whether the trial judge has failed to comply with the statutory requirements set out in the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 and if so whether such failure had occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant. This court will further examine whether a different sentence should have been passed taking into account all the facts and circumstances of this case, including any errors of law or fact of the trial court. 
 
 
[29] In determining these issues, I am more inclined to engage in an assessment keeping in mind the broader principles of sentencing statutorily recognised as sentencing guidelines in section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 rather than converting its process to applying a series of mathematical equations. 
 
 
[30] It is also pertinent to note that the trial judge in determining the sentence in this case has used 11 years as a starting point which is towards the lower end of the accepted tariff for a case of this nature – committing rape on a child victim. The Supreme Court in Raj v The State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 0003.2014 (20 August 2014) approved 10-16 years imprisonment as the correct tariff for the rape of a child.
 
 
[31] Therefore, the starting point of 11 years for the offence of rape in this case, is well within the lawful tariff for a case of child rape. 
 
 
[32] In this case the appellant who is the step grandfather of the victim abused his position of trust and command, in abusing the victim for a continuous period of nearly nine years. When the first incident of penile penetration occurred the victim was 6 year old child. It had not been an isolated incident but the beginning of a series of continued abuse. The conduct of the appellant converted the safest place for the victim – her home - to the most dangerous place in this world. 
 
 
[33] The victim impact statement admitted in the trial court reflects that the victim 'has shown a lot of changes in life style for a young girl of her age. The trauma she had gone through during the incident had affected her mentally, physically. She feels like to be isolated all the times, lack of concentration, having nightmare and slow to respond'.
 
 
[34] I observe that the final sentence of 13 years, that had been imposed on the appellant for two counts of Rape, still remain towards the lower end of the lawful tariff.
 
 
[35] In arriving at this final figure, the following deductions had been made by the trial Judge, taking into account several mitigating factors: 
 
  
• Offences of Rape - 5 years
 
• Offences of Indecent Assault - 2 years
 
• Offences of Sexual Assault - 2 years
 

[36] The factors other than the time spent in remand custody and factors relating to the 'guilty plea' that were taken into account by the trial judge are as follows:
 
  
• The appellant was a 55 year old married person with no children,
 
• The appellant reached class 6 education, and,
 
•  The appellant had not committed any offence for the last 10 years and this is his first sexual offending
 

[37] Furthermore, I am of the view that the factors (a) and (b) above will have an insignificant impact as mitigating factors in a case of this nature. It is the marriage between the appellant and the victim's grandmother which gave the opportunity to the appellant to commit this series of sexual assaults on the six year old victim. The appellant had totally disregarded and ignored the moral responsibilities that are attached to a marital relationship, more particularly, the responsibility to care and foster their descendants. A more humane and responsible conduct is expected from a middle aged man. The fact that the appellant received formal education only up to class 6 cannot mitigate the legal consequences attached to his immoral conduct.
 
 
[38] Therefore the deduction of 5 years for the offence of rape in this case can be reasonably accounted for the time spent in remand, the guilty plea and the good behavior (good character) of the appellant. 
 
 
[39] It is also pertinent to note, that the trial judge had ordered terms of imprisonments imposed on all seven counts to operate concurrently, making the total period of incarceration to 13 years. 
 
 
[40] In Raj (supra) the Supreme Court cited with approval and endorsed the following observation of the Court of Appeal:
 
 
""Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years. There can be no fault in the sentencing approach of the learned Judge referred to above (in paragraph 13), save as to say we do not consider that allowance should have been made for family circumstances. To that extent the appellant was afforded leniency that he did not deserve.""
 
 
[41] I am of the view that any further deductions to the 13 year sentence of imprisonment in this case will fail to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such action as well as will fail to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature.
 
 
[42] Taking into account all these factors, I am of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial court is lawful and this court should not intervene with it. Therefore, pursuant to section 23(3) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. 12, the appeal is dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial Judge is affirmed.
 
 
Madigan JA:
[43] I have read in draft the judgment of Jayasuriya J.A. and I would agree that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed given the very lenient sentence already passed on the appellant in the Court below.
 
 
[44] I would however add the following paragraphs with regard to sentencing practice and pleas of guilty.
 
 
[45] Although the judge passing sentence below took all matters complained of into consideration when assessing an appropriate ""global"" sentence, it is better sentencing practice to specify terms of discount when allowing for such matters as pleas of guilty, time on remand and clear record for example. The convict and the reader can then see easily the various components of a sentence and sentence appeals could be prevented.
 
 
[46] Discount for a plea of guilty should be the last component of a sentence after additions and deductions are made for aggravating and mitigating circumstances respectively. It has always been accepted (though not by authorative judgment) that the ""high water mark"" of discount is one third for a plea willingly made at the earliest opportunity. This Court now adopts that principle to be valid and to be applied in all future proceedings at first instance.
 
 
[47] Pleas of guilty made at later stages than earliest opportunity cause more difficulties in the assessment of how much discount should be afforded to them. It is not for this Court to suggest an appropriate sliding scale because it must remain a matter of judicial discretion. We would however make three points very clear in this regard:
 
 
 (i) A plea of guilty before trial must be afforded some discount given that the cost of trial (including time and cost of assessors) is saved.
 
 (ii) A plea of guilty at a later stage before a trial involving a vulnerable witness must be given a meaningful discount (say 20-25%) to recognize the fact that the vulnerable witness is not put through the ordeal of giving evidence.
 
 (iii) A plea during trial after an accused has heard unshakeable evidence of a victim/complainant or after an inculpatorycaution interview has been admitted into evidence is not deserving of any discount whatsoever.
 

The Orders of the Court are:
 
  
• The Sentence of the High Court dated 15 March 2012 is affirmed.
 
• Appeal is dismissed.

251854,"RULING
 
 
[1] The appellant was charged with digital rape of a juvenile girl. Following a trial in the High Court at Suva, the three assessors gave their opinions that the appellant was not guilty of the charge. The trial judge disagreed and in a written judgment convicted the appellant of rape and sentenced him to 9 years, 11 months and 14 days imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, 11 months and 14 days. This is a timely application for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence pursuant to section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. 12. The test for leave to appeal against conviction is whether the appeal is arguable (Naisua v State unreported Cr. App. No. CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). The test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether there is an arguable error in the sentencing discretion (Naisua v State unreported Cr. App. No. CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). 
 
 
[2] Briefly, the facts were that on 22 July 2013, the appellant invited the victim to his home to baby sit his child. The victim was 16 years old. Her mother dropped her off at the appellant’s house in the morning. Occasionally, the victim’s parents did paid house chores for the appellant. When the appellant returned home, he went and sat beside the victim, while the appellant’s child was in the shower. The appellant removed the victim’s pants and the underwear and penetrated her vagina with his fingers without her consent. As a result, the victim’s hymen was ruptured. She managed to push the appellant away and at that point he got up and went away. When the victim’s mother returned in the afternoon to the appellant’s house, she observed that the victim was distressed. When they returned to their home, the victim told her mother that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant. The matter was reported to police.
 
 
[3] Counsel for the appellant advances the following grounds of appeal:
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact by failing to consider the medical evidence which stated that the injury appeared to have occurred within 24 to 28 hours and the doctor further defining in his evidence under oath that he should have stated that the injury has occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination, thereby implying that the injury was possibly 2 days old.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self-inflicted, therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the Appellant who had caused the injuries to the Complainant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self-inflicted, therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the Appellant who had caused the injuries to the Complainant. 
 
 
• THAT the Learned trial Judge erred in law and fact in not considering that had the Appellant intended to commit the offence, he could have chosen the more probable venues, which were the 3 bedrooms in the house rather than choosing the sitting room to be fully exposed to the Appellant’s 10 year old daughter and an uninterrupted access to the daughter at anytime.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself and contracted himself in accordance with the directions given in his summing up at (paragraph 8) when assessing the testimony of a witness.

THAT the Learned Trial Judged erred in law and fact in holding that the evidence given by the 2nd Defence Witness, Nisha Neha Bilash was not credible and that the demeanor at the time she gave evidence was not acceptable and failing to c consider the age of the witness at the time of giving evidence, in that she was clearly facing the Trial Judge, all the counsels, the assessors and the Appellant throughout the entire time that she gave evidence, hence eye contact with the Appellant could not be avoided at the material time, and further that she gave clear answers to the questions asked and also, that similar type of demeanor was portrayed by the Doctor when she gave evidence in that there were long pauses before he answered the questions and he took longer time to give h is answers despite being a professional and deemed to have sufficient knowledge of the injuries in question and who looked down most of the time at the time of answering questions.
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding that the evidence of the Complainant was credible when he failed to consider that there were several inconsistencies in her evidence in court, compared to the information that she gave to police and the she gave to the medical doctor. Failure to direct himself on previous inconsistent statement in law of the complainant cause substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in accepting the evidence of the Complainant when she said in re-examination that the reason she did not tell the police about the Appellant kissing her breast was because she was scared and ashamed when it ought to hold that such an explanation was least probable in light of fact that she was without any hesitation able to tell the police about the alleged penetration in her vagina by the Appellant, and therefore the Complainant’s version of the whole situation ought not be believed.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding the Complainant as a credible witness and not taking into account that on one hand the Complainant gave evidence that the Appellant had forced her pants down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down, whilst on the other hand she admitted that her clothes buttons were not broken, her clothes were still in good condition when her mother came to take her at 5.00 pm, she did not have any bruises or marks over her hands or waist area, and she did not shout even to raise alarm for Neha Nishika Bilash to hear who was right inside the house or to the neighbours, whose house were just 2 to 3 meters away.
 
 
• THAT the Learned trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding that the offence was committed by the Appellant when the Appellant’s daughter was having her bath, without any cogent proof evidence and not accepting the daughter’s evidence when she said that she never went for a bath whilst the Complainant was at their home between 4.00 pm to 5.00 pm.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not accepting the evidence given by the Appellant without any cogent reasoning.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding that Neha Nishika Bilash’s evidence was inconsistent and unreliable when Neha stated that she did not see her father put the bag on the dining table and taking out food, and also when she said her father was still eating when the Complainant’s mother came whereas the Appellant’s version was that he had already eaten before the Complainant’s mother came, and failing to consider that whatever happened in the kitchen was irrelevant and that the main issue was as to whether the incident as alleged by Complainant occurred in the sitting room during that time. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected and contradicted himself in his summing up paragraphs 9, 10 and 11.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in overturning the unanimous decisions of the Assessors of Not Guilty and failing to consider that the facts of the case and the evidence given by each of the witness clearly indicated that the Complaint by the Complainant was highly likely to be falsely made.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in misdirecting himself when he stated that “I observed the demeanor of the complainant when she gave evidence. I did not note any attempt by her to exaggerate. In my view, she gave honest answers” relying only on the demeanor of the Complainant and not whole evidence as a whole caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge did not direct himself and take into consideration the evidence of the Medical Practitioner that there could be possibility that the complainant did not suffer any injuries as during the complainant’s examination no injuries were found and as such there is possibility that no injury was caused to her.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge did not consider/ analyze the Defence case adequately/or in detail in particular the evidence of the Accused’s daughter who was present in the room with the victim but did not see the Appellant committing the offence as charged. In the circumstances there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding the Appellant guilty that when the Appellant was called at the Police Station he was not interviewed on the same day. The Police Officers told the Appellant that he would be interviewed later and despite the fact the Appellant requested that it was getting late night and he requested the Police Officers to take the Complainant for medical examination same night because he was concerned that the Complainant will go and do something to herself and thereafter blame the appellant by not doing so there was a substantial miscarriage of justice as it created serious doubts of self inflicted injuries by the Complainant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in overruling the unanimous verdict of the Assessors of Not Guilty did not give cogent reasons as to why he overruled the unanimous not guilty opinion of the three assessors in light of the whole of the evidence presented in the trial.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself that the Prosecution evidence before the Court proved beyond reasonable doubts that there were serious doubts in the Prosecution case and as such the benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the Appellant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in commenting on the evidence raising a new theory on the facts, uncanvassed during the course of the trial whereby the defence has had no opportunity of commenting upon it.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to refer any Summing Up the possible defence on evidence and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately/sufficiently/referring/directing/putting/considering the Appellant’s case to the Prosecutions and Defence evidence.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge while correctly directing the assessors in paragraph 5 of his Summing Up that “You must not speculate about what evidence there might have been” misdirected himself and erred in law and in fact in speculating when he stated in his Judgment Paragraph 26 that “The defence counsel attempted to paint the picture that the complainant was poor, she wears short and tight fittings and she made this complaint in order to claim money from the accused. The unanimous in order opinion of the assessors that the accused is not guilty shows the defence counsel has in fact been successful in painting that picture in the minds of the assessors. In my view that picture had prejudiced the assessors mind against the complainant and the assessors failed to comprehend that those facts are not relevant in deciding whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offence charged.”
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by finding the Appellant guilty of the offence charged contradicted himself in his summing up at paragraph 67 when he gave inter alia 3 options:-
  
• (i) You may believe his expectations and, if you believe him, then your opinion must be that the accused is ‘not guilty’.
 
 
• (ii) Without necessarily believing him you may think, ‘well what he says might be true’. If that is so, it means that there is reasonable doubt in your mind and therefore, again your opinion must be ‘not guilty’.
 
 
• (iii) The third possibility is that you reject his evidence, But if you disbelieve him, that itself does not make him guilty of an offence charged. The situation would then be the same as if he had not given any evidence at all. You should still consider whether prosecution has proved all the elements beyond reasonable doubt. If you are sure that the prosecution has proved all the elements, then your proper opinion would be that the accused is ‘guilty’ of the offence.
 


That despite the above directions the 3 assessors found the appellant not guilty and the Learned Trial Judge by overturning their unanimous opinion of not guilty and without giving cogent reasons had caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• THAT the Appellant reserves the right to appeal such further and other Grounds as the Appellant may be advised upon the receipt of the Court Record.
 

APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• THAT the Appellant relies on Grounds 1 to 23 stated herein above.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in ordering a sentence of 9 years 11 months and 14 days with parole of 7 years 11 months and 14 days, which is manifestly excessive and failed to consider that the facts of the case were not so grave as to amount to a harsh and severe penalty.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in considering that the Police Officer had cooperated with the Appellant in allowing him more time during the investigation process when it ought to have considered that it was the Appellant who had cooperated with police for some 10 months, that was since the date of the complaint, until the time the Appellant was charged by Police, and therefore this factor ought to be considered as a ground for mitigation whilst passing the sentence.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the Appellant and not taking into relevant consideration.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 when he passed the sentence against the Appellant.
 

[4] At the hearing, both parties relied upon their respective written submissions. Unfortunately, a substantial part of the appellant’s submissions deal with the test for leave to appeal. Without making submissions on each ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submits that the grounds are arguable and have strong prospects of success for leave and bail to be granted. 
 
 
[5] The victim was medically examined a day after the alleged incident. The examining doctor found that the victim’s hymen was ruptured. The doctor’s opinion was that the injury had occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination. The doctor said that the injury could have been caused by a penis, finger or a foreign object penetrating the vagina vigorously. The doctor also said that there was a possibility that the injury could be self-inflicted but it would be very painful. The learned trial judge fairly summarized the medical evidence in his summing-up. At the end of the day, the medical evidence did not implicate the appellant. The learned trial judge convicted the appellant because he believed the victim was telling the truth when she said the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his fingers. Grounds one, two, three and fourteen are unarguable.
 
 
[6] Grounds four and sixteen are speculative and unarguable. 
 
 
[7] There is no contradiction in the manner in which the learned trial judge dealt with the testimony of the appellant’s daughter. In paragraphs 12, 13 and 23 of the judgment, the learned trial judge gave reasons why he chose not to give much weight to the evidence of the appellant’s daughter. Grounds five, nine, eleven and fifteen are unarguable. 
 
 
[8] The inconsistencies in the evidence of the victim were dealt in the summing-up and in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the judgment. The learned trial judge did not find the inconsistencies material. He found the victim to be a credible witness despite the inconsistencies. Grounds six, seven and eight are unarguable. 
 
 
[9] The learned trial judge dealt with the appellant’s evidence in paragraphs 11 and 20 of the judgment. The learned trial judge gave cogent reasons for not believing the appellant’s evidence. Ground ten is unarguable. 
 
 
[10] The learned trial judge gave detailed reasons for not accepting the opinions of the assessors. The reasons given for convicting the appellant are cogent. I think both the summing-up and the judgment are impeccable. Grounds twelve and seventeen to twenty-three are unarguable. 
 
 
[11] The learned trial judge did not misdirect when he found the victim to be an honest witness based on her demeanour when she gave evidence. Ground thirteen is unarguable. 
 
 
[12] The sentence of 9 years, 11 months and 14 days for rape of a juvenile girl in a contested case is on the lower end of the tariff for rape (Raj v State unreported CAV003.2014; 20 August 2014). The learned trial judge’s assessment of the aggravating and mitigating factors was correct. I am not convinced that there is an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
 
 
-
 
[13] For these reasons, I refuse leave to appeal against conviction and sentence. 
 
 
[14] The test for bail pending appeal is more stringent. When considering granting of bail to a convicted person, the court must bear in mind that the presumption in favour of grant of bail is displaced. The Bail Act 2002 specifically requires the court to consider the following factors when considering bail pending an appeal:
 
 
 (a) The likelihood of success in the appeal;
 
 (b) The likely time before the appeal hearing;
 
 (c) The proportion of the original sentence which will have been served by the appellant when the appeal is heard.
 

[15] The threshold for the likelihood of success is very high. Bail is granted only if the appeal has a very high likelihood of success (Zhong v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU44 of 2013; 15 July 2014, Tiritiri v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU9 of 2011; 17 July 2015). 
 
 
[16] It therefore follows that the two remaining factors set out in section 17(3) are less significant when the threshold of a very high likelihood of success has not been met (Seniloli & Others v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU0041/04S; 23 August 2004). So far the appellant has served ten months of his sentence. 
 
 
[17] When considering the factors under section 17(3), the court may also consider exceptional circumstances, that is, “circumstances which drive the court to the conclusion that justice can only be done by granting bail” (Mudaliar v The State unreported Cr App. No. AAU0032 of 2006; 16 June 2006, at [5] per Ward P). None of the matters advanced by the appellant constitutes exceptional circumstance especially when the appellant has failed to satisfy the threshold of a very high likelihood of success in appeal (Silatolu v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU0024 of 2003; 27 September 2004). For these reasons, the application for bail fails. 
 
 
[18] Result
 
 
Leave to appeal against conviction and sentence is refused.
 
The application for bail pending appeal is refused.

72073,"JUDGMENT

This is an appeal against sentence, in respect of a term of three years and four months imprisonment imposed on the Appellant for the following charge:

Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED RAPE: contrary for Section 151 of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

JIOJI AUNIMA on the 16th day of March, 2001 at Nasinu in the Central Division, attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of RAIJIELI AKANISI without her consent.

The appeal was against conviction and sentence, but at the hearing of the appeal, counsel proceeded with the appeal against sentence only.

The facts of the case, as outlined by the prosecution were that on the 16th of March 2001 at about 7.30pm, the victim was on her way to visit her cousin when she met the Appellant. He told her he know of a pastor on Khalsa Road, who sold second-hand clothes. She accompanied him, and when they passed a vacant house, the Appellant grabbed her, and forced her to lie on the ground. He then pulled her panties down to her knees. She yelled out, and a Fijian man passing by, came to her rescue. He took the Appellant to the police station where he admitted committing the offence.

These facts were admitted by the Appellant in the Magistrate’s Court and he was convicted as charged.

In mitigation he said he was 25 years old, married, had one son and was employed as a carpenter at Falekau Industries. He expressed remorse and asked for a non custodial sentence. He has one previous conviction on 22nd October 1996, for larceny.

In his sentence remarks the learned Magistrate said the maximum sentence for Attempted Rape was 7 years imprisonment and that the starting point should therefore be 5 years imprisonment. The Appellant was given one-third discount for the guilty plea and the sentence passed was therefore three years and four months imprisonment.

At the hearing of this appeal, Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the starting point of five years imprisonment was wrong in principle. He said that the tariff for attempted rape in Fiji was considerable less than five years and suggested that the correct starting point should have been twenty-one months as it was in Vereniki Marawa –v- The State Criminal Appeal No. 018 of 1998.

State Counsel opposed the appeal saying that Vereniki Marawa (supra) was distinguishable, and that because this was a serious case of Attempted Rape, the starting point of five years imprisonment was right in principle.

A tariff sentence is usually passed where the court recognises the need to deterrent sentence. The range of sentences that make up the tariff for a particular offence, is usually determined by the courts. The maximum statutory sentence is not always a good indication of what the tariff might be, because the legislature often sets a statutory maximum far in excess of an appropriate term, in order to give the court a wide discretion for sentencing. In most case, the statutory maximum sentence would only be appropriate for the worst type of offending.

The range of sentence which indicate the tariff is easily discernable from the reported cases for a particular type of offending. The decision for the sentence is then to decide on the appropriate starting point. D.A. Thomas ""Principles of Sentencing"" says (at page 38): 

""This process is governed primarily by concepts of proportion, the relative seriousness of the offence as an instance of its kind, and arguments based on deterrence are not permitted to override this factor. What may be considered the average offence of its kind is place near the middle of the range; as in the case of statutory maxima, room must be left within the effective range to deal with the most serious examples likely to be encountered.""

In the absence of guideline judgments which set out the tariff for particular types of offending, it is not always easy to recognize the tariff established by the courts. This is because, much of the sentencing, which is done in the Magistrate’s Courts, is not always available to the High Court or the Court of Appeal. In this case both counsel have submitted those authorities they were able to obtain and they are useful as an indication of a tariff for Attempted Rape.

In Vereniki Marawa –v- The State (supra) Surman J quashed a suspended sentence passed by a magistrate, on appeal by the State and substituted a term of twelve months imprisonment. He adopted a starting point of twenty-one months imprisonment, saying that the case was not the most serious of its kind. Indeed in outlining the facts, which were that the accused had accosted and 18 year old girl, pressed her neck, pulled down his pants said he wanted to have sex with her, his Lordship said that the case was really a ""borderline case"" of Attempted Rape. He said it was arguable that the accused should really have been charged with indecent Assault.

In Latchman Prasad Sharma –v- The State Criminal Appeal No. 0027 of 1997, Pain J considered a sentence of 4 years imprisonment for Attempted Rape, after a defending hearing. The evidence was that the victim was 12 years old, the Appellant had tried to penetrate her vagina but could not, and he performed other degrading acts on her. There was an element of breach of trust and some subterfuge employed by the Appellant. He had previous convictions for similar offences. Pain J refused to reduce the sentence, saying, at page 6:

""Substantial prison sentences are common for this offence. Sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment have been confirmed in this court in Epeli Ratabacaca –v- The State (Crim. App. No. 106 of 1991) and Watisoni Davui –v- The State (Crim. App. No. 10 of 1997)"".

In Watisoni Davui –v- The State (supra) the Appellant had punched the victim, taken her to a cassava patch, thrown her to the ground, assaulted her again and pulled down her pants before getting on top of her. He was sentenced, after a defended hearing to 3 ½ years imprisonment. Pain J upheld the sentence saying there was only a fine line between the attempt and the completed offence. He said that 3 ½ years imprisonment was within the acceptable range.

In Epeli Ratabacaca –v- The State (supra) a sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment for Attempted Rape was upheld by Jayaratne J on appeal from a defended hearing. The facts of the case are not set out in the judgment, but the charge was originally one of Rape, and the Appellant was a first offender.

Counsel also referred to English authorities on sentences for Attempted Rape. However, the tariff in England is not strictly comparable because the statutory maximum sentence for Attempted Rape is life imprisonment under section 3 (Schedule 2, para 1(a)) of the Sexual Offences Act 1985.

However, the guidelines issued by the Court of Appeal in R -v- Billam 82 Cr. App. R. 347 are helpful as to what factors may constitute aggravating or mitigation factors. Aggravating factors are:

1. Violence used over and above the force necessary to commit the offence;
2. The use of weapons;
3. Repeated rapes
4. Planning
5. Previous convictions for sexual offences;
6. The victim was subjected to further sexual indignities;
7. The victim was very old or very young;
8. The trauma suffered and the effect on the victim was especially serious.

Mitigation features include:

1. Previous good character;
2. Guilty plea.

It was held in Billam that the starting point for Attempted Rape should normally be less that for the completed offence, especially if the offender was stopped at an early stage. However in some cases, the sentence for Attempted Rape could be heavier that some examples of the completed offence.

Thus in R –v- Behich (1986) 8 Cr. App. R(s) 387 a sentence of seven years imprisonment for Attempted Rape was upheld where there was a serious degree of violence. In R –v- Williams (1987) 9 Cr. App. R(s) 491, on facts similar to this case before me, a sentence of five years imprisonment was reduced to four years.

Applying all these principles, I find that the accepted tariff for Attempted Rape in the Fiji Courts ranges from 12 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. A starting point should then be chosen according to the seriousness of the offending.

In the case before me, a starting point of 5 years imprisonment was not appropriate. This was not the most serious offence of its kind. There was no evidence of injuries, extreme youth or age of the victim, or of the use of weapons or gratuitous violence. However, it was clearly not the least serious of its kind, which might have justified the lowest starting point. The Appellant used subterfuge to lure the victim to a vacant house, he deliberately referred to a pastor to gain her confidence, he would have completed the offence if he had not been disturbed, and he used force to get the victim to lei down pulling her panties down to her knees. This was not a ""borderline"" indecent assault.

As such I consider a starting point of 4 years imprisonment to be appropriate. The Appellant was entitled to a reduction for his guilty plea of one year, but was not entitled to any further reduction for good character. In all the circumstances, I consider a sentence of 3 years imprisonment to be appropriate.

The sentence of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment is quashed and substituted with a term of 3 years imprisonment.

The appeal is successful to that extent.

	1.	SERU SAUKURU, you were charged for the offence of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Crime Decree No 44 of 2009. Since the victim is a Juvenile the Court has suppressed his name. 

	2.	You waived right to counsel and pleaded guilty to the above offence on 07 March 2013. You also admitted the summary of facts tendered to the Court. 

	3.	According to the summary of facts between 01-02-2013 to 28-02-2013 the victim was playing rugby at Batinikia when you approached him and removed his trousers. Then you started sucking his penis. 

	4.	I am satisfied you fully understand the legal effects of your plea. You informed to this Court that there was no inducement, promise or threat for pleading guilty. I am satisfied also it was made voluntarily. Therefore I convict you for Indecent Assault. 

LAW AND TARIFF 

	1.	Maximum penalty for this offence is 05 years imprisonment. In RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S Shameem J held that ""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type""

	2.	Upon considering the summary of facts in this case I select 20 months imprisonment as the starting point for your sentence. 

Aggravating factors

	1.	The victim was 13 years old at that time of the offence. He was vulnerable. For these I increase your sentence by 10 months. Now your sentence would be 30 months imprisonment. 

Mitigating factors

	1.	I consider following mitigating factors which were brought before me in your mitigation submission.
	I.	20 years old 
	II.	Single 
	III.	Seeking forgiveness from court
	IV.	First offender

	2.	Since you have pleaded guilty in the first available instance you are entitled for a reduction of 1/3 of the total period of imprisonment. (Akili Vilimone v State). There by your sentence stands for 20 months. 

	3.	I deduct further 06 months for other mitigating factors to reach the period of 14 months. 

	4.	I am mindful that under s. 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I can suspend a sentence which is below two years. 

	5.	Even though you are a first young offender considering the nature of the crime I do not want to suspend your sentence. There is increase of sexual violence against women and children in this country and the Court should give sentences to deter people from doing these offences. Your sentence will be a message to future offenders too that they can't expect mercy for these kinds of offences. 

	6.	Accordingly, I sentence you to 14 months imprisonment period for the offence of Indecent Assault contrary to section 291 of the Crime Decree No 44 of 2009 to be served concurrently with C.F. 100/2013.

28 days to appeal.

74472,"JUDGMENT
 
The Appellant was convicted on one count of doing Grievous Harm to his six year old son, by the Nausori Magistrates Court on 30th November 2000. The charge read as follows:
 
Statement of Offence
 
GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 227 of the Penal Code, Cap 17.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
Ratu Waisea Bulaikalou, on the 12th day of June 1996 at Naqelewai village, Wainimala, Naitasiri, in the Central Division, unlawfully and maliciously does grievous harm to Ratu Isireli Naboro.
 
He originally pleaded not guilty, and the trial proceeded on the 15th of November 1996. The Appellant’s son, Ratu Isireli Naboro gave evidence, followed by Dr Nelle Van Beuren, a paediatrician at the CWM Hospital. The evidence was that on the 12th day of June 1996, the Appellant’s son, who was six years old at the time, came home late from school. The Appellant assaulted him, and threw him inside the house where he hit the wall. He became unconscious and regained consciousness at Vunidawa Hospital.
 
Dr Van Beuren said that she examined the child on the 13th of June 1996. He was suffering from convulsions and vomiting. An examination showed a hemiplegia on the right side and a right eye which deviated towards the right.
 
A fundoscopy showed a right rational haemorrhage and a cat scan showed a left cerebella haemorrhage and a right frontal haemorrhage. She said that her opinion was that the child had been physically abused.
 
The trial then adjourned due to the absence of witnesses and the accused. He was arrested on Bench Warrant on 25th July 1997, but he absconded again until 25th August 2000 when he was arrested by the military. The hearing finally proceeded on 15th November 2000, when the Appellant changed his plea to one of Guilty.
 
The record of previous convictions was disputed by the Appellant and he was sentenced on the basis that he was a first offender. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment. A Social Welfare Report, requested by the court shows that the victim was a child of the Appellant’s first marriage. It shows that the Appellant paid no maintenance for the child, who was brought up by his grandparents. The child visited his father for Christmas in 1995, and remained there until the offence was committed. The Appellant was by then in a de facto relationship with another partner with whom he had three children.
 
The Social Welfare Report states that the child Isireli, claimed that he did not wish to stay with his father, who was rough “and beat him most of the time.”
 
The Appellant appeals on the ground that the sentence was harsh and excessive, that he was not given a chance to mitigate, and that he should have been given a suspended sentence. In court, he said he wished to return to his family to support his wife and children.
 
The State opposes the appeal saying that the sentence was not lenient given the aggravating circumstances of the case.
 
There is nothing in the court record, and the circumstances of the offender, which would justify a reduction of this sentence. The victim, who was 6 years old, was the Appellant’s son. The victim should have been able to trust the Appellant not to abuse him. The child received serious head injuries which resulted in hospitalisation. Furthermore, the Social Welfare Report suggests a history of abuse.
 
Offences against children have become prevalent. It is not known whether they have always been common in Fiji and under-reported, or whether offences against children have become more common in recent times.
 
Whatever the case, this court has a responsibility to ensure that deterrent sentences are passed to express the disapproval of society towards offences against children. Children are vulnerable to a number of social evils. They are particularly vulnerable to assaults of all kinds from the very people whom they should be able to love, trust and respect - their own families. As was said at the World Summit for Children, in 1990:
 
“The children of the world are innocent, vulnerable and dependent. They are also curious, active and full of hope. Their time should be one of joy and peace, of playing, learning and growing. Their future should be shaped in harmony and co-operation ... But for many children, the reality of childhood is altogether different.”
 
In all the circumstances, the sentence of 2 years imprisonment to the Appellant is not excessive, nor is it wrong in principle.
 
This appeal is dismissed.

Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA073/04S stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence...Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld (Amasai Korovata v. The State [2006] HAA 115/06S.

	9.	In addition the court also orders that you pay a fine of 3 penalty units ($300.00) as fine which is to be paid within 21 days. In default 30 days in prison.

78942,"RULING

The appellant in this matter was convicted and sentenced at the Nadi Magistrates Court on the 17th February 2004 with respect to a charge of Indecent Assault and a further charge of Wrongful Confinement.

Particulars of the offences are: 

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

AFZAL KHAN s/o Shamsher Khan on the 29th day of November 2002 at Nadi, in the Western Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely SELAI SINUKULA.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

WRONGFUL CONFINEMENT: Contrary to section 256 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

AFZAL KHAN s/o Shamsher Khan on the 29th day of November 2002 at Nadi, in the Western Division, wrongfully confined a girl namely SELAI SINUKULA.

The facts as they appear from the record of the Magistrates Court were that the appellant was employed at the complainant’s school. That the complainant got into the appellant’s motor vehicle and that he took her ultimately to Wailoaloa Beach without her permission instead of taking her to her home. That at the beach the appellant kissed her on the lips once and touched her thighs. That he put her dress up and stated that she looked beautiful. At the time of the commission of the offences, the complainant was a class 3 student and 10 years of age.

There is no suggestion in the facts as found by the Learned Magistrate that there was any touching on the genitals or any penetration. The medical report tendered before the Learned Magistrate confirms that there was in fact no apparent penetration or physical injury to the complainant.

The Learned Magistrate sentenced the appellant to a period of 2 years imprisonment with respect to the indecent assault and 12 months imprisonment with respect to the wrongful confinement and then ordered that the sentences be served consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

The appellant appeals to this court against the sentences imposed upon him. The tariff for the offence of indecent assault was considered by Madam Justice Shameem in Josateki Seru v The State – Criminal Appeal No. HAA0050 of 2003S. Her Ladyship reiterated what she said to Penioni Ratoto v The State in Criminal Appeal No. HAA0068 of 2002S, the principles there set out are:

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was use, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty, which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.

These are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate.

A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guideline than these.”

As I have already indicated the facts as found by the Learned Magistrate made it clear that there was indeed no penetration in the assault affected by the appellant nor was there any violence or weapons of any type used. The victim however is a child of 10 years of age and this in itself is an aggravation.

The appellant was entitled to no discount before the Learned Magistrate for entering a plea of guilty as the matter proceeded by way of defended hearing and of course he is not to be the subject of any additional penalty because he chose to defend the matter.

It would appear that the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years is within the range and certainly is not manifestly excessive or wrong at law, such as to warrant this court interfering with it. Similarly, the sentence of 12 months imposed with respect with the wrongful confinement is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle such as with warrant this court interfering with it.

The Learned Magistrate did however order that the sentences be served consecutively.

The facts as found by the Learned Magistrate clearly indicate that both offences were committed at the same time and that it was all part of the one event. In these circumstances, the sentencing guidelines are clear that sentences for offences, which are all part of the one incident, should be served concurrently and accordingly, the Order of the Court will be:

1. Appeal is allowed.

2. Sentence of the Learned Magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years imprisonment is confirmed.

3. Sentence of the Learned Magistrate with respect to wrongful confinement of 12 months is confirmed.

4. Both sentences to be served concurrently.

SEVENTH COUNT 
Statement of Offence

SEXUAL ASSAULT: contrary to section 210(1)(a) and (2) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

POATE RAINIMA on the 16th day of January 2011, at Nadawa in the Southern Division, had unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely SV by bringing his mouth into contact with the vagina of SV.

2. You told the court that your application for legal aid was denied by the Legal Aid Commission. You waived your right to legal counsel, and said that, you would represent yourself. As a result, the charges were read and explained to you. You said, you understood them, and you pleaded guilty to all of them. You told the court that, no one forced you to plead guilty to all the counts, and that you did so out of your own free will. 

3. The prosecutor then read her summary of facts in court. Briefly, they were as follows. The complainant female child was born on 10th October, 1996, and resided with her parents, at Nadawa in the Central Division. Her grandmother was also living with them. The grandmother's husband (ie. her grandfather) died. In 1998, the accused married the grandmother, and started living with the complainant's family. So the accused became the female complainant's step grandfather.

4. Between the 30th April to 31st August 2002, when the complainant was about 6 years old, the accused forcefully pulled her into his bedroom. The time was between 3 to 4pm, and her parents were asleep in their room. Her grandmother was away selling crabs at the market. The accused, who was 45 years old at the time, forcefully pulled her clothes down, got on top of her and thrust his penis into her vagina. He later ejaculated, and the complainant's vagina bled as a result. [Count No. 1].

5. The abuse continued between the 1st to 31st December 2006, when the complainant was now 10 years old. The accused was now 49 years old. The accused again forcefully pulled the complainant into his bedroom, took off her clothes, and began licking her whole body, including sucking her vagina and inserting his finger into her vagina. [Count No. 2]. Five months later, between 1st May and 31st August, 2007, the accused forcefully took the complainant to a nearby mangrove. There he forcefully told her to lie on the sand. He then sucked the whole of her body, including her vagina. Later, he penetrated her vagina, with his penis. [Counts No. 3 and 4].

6. Between the 1st January to 31st April 2008, the accused again forcefully pulled the complainant into his room. He closed the door. He forcefully took off her clothes, and sucked her vagina [Count No. 5]. This abuse was again repeated on 8th January, 2011. The complainant was now 15 years old, while the accused was 54 years old. The accused took the complainant to the mangroves on the pretext of getting a pole for their clothes line. At the mangrove, the accused forced the complainant to lie on the sand, forcefully took off her clothes, and then sucked her vagina [Count No. 6]. On 16th January 2011, the accused again forced the complainant to the mangrove, and repeated the above abuse to her ie. sucked her vagina [Count No. 7]. On 23rd January 2011, the above abuse were reported to police. An investigating was carried out. The accused was arrested on 25th January, 2011. He was caution interviewed on 27th January, 2011, wherein he admitted the above offences. He was later charged for the above offences.

7. Since the accused was unrepresented, the court checked with him to see that, all the ingredient of the offences, were admitted by him. On the two charges of rape [ie. Count Nos. 1 and 4], the complainant was allegedly raped when she was 6 years (2002) and 11 years old (2007). So, the rape involved a child. On the two rape counts, the accused admitted that he penetrated the complainant's vagina with his penis. This in itself is sufficient to ground a conviction for rape against a child, since a child under 13 years is incapable, as a matter of law, of giving her consent. And by penetrating the child's vagina with his penis, an accused is presumed to know that a child is incapable of giving her consent, at the time of sexual intercourse.

8. On the ""indecent assault"" charges [ie. Count Nos. 2,3 and 5], the accused admitted that, he sucked and licked the complainant's vagina, at the material times, and in the case of count No. 2, he also inserted a finger into the complainant's vagina. He agreed that the above acts were indecent, and that the complainant did not consent, and he knew she was not consenting at the time. 

9. On the ""sexual assault"" charges [ie. Count Nos. 6 and 7], the accused admitted he sucked the complainant's vagina at the material times, and that the complainant never consented, and he knew she was not consenting at the time. On the basis that the accused admitted to the court all the elements of count Nos. 1 to 7, the court found him guilty as charged on all counts, and convicted him accordingly, on all those counts.

10. I note that you haven't offended in the last 10 years, and you have no previous conviction for any sexual offence. I also note you have no objections against your antecedent report and the victim-impact report. I have also considered your verbal plea in mitigation.

11. We will first consider the ""rape"" counts, because they are the most serious of the offences, then the ""sexual assault"" offences, and last, the ""indecent assault"" matters.

12. Rape is a serious offence. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment. For adults, the tariff is a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal. 

13. Since the complainant in this case was a child, the tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 15 years: see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. HAC 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors. 

14. ""Indecent assault"" carries a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment. The tariff for ""indecent assault"" is a sentence between 1 to 4 years imprisonment. The more serious the indecent assault is, the higher the sentence will be: see Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0068 of 2002S, High Court, Suva; Sikeli Nayate v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 46 of 2008, High Court, Suva.

15. ""Sexual assaults"" carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. It is an aggravated form of indecent assault. The tariff for this offence has yet to be established.

16. The mitigating factors in your case were as follows:

(i) You are 55 years old, married with no children;
(ii) You reached Class 6 education;
(iii) You have committed no offence in the last 10 years, and this is your first sexual offending;
(iv) You pleaded guilty to the charges, although this was approximately 1 year 1 month, after the first call in the High Court. Consequently, you have saved the court's time, and avoided the need for the complainant to relive her ordeal in the courtroom, by giving evidence;
(v) It appears you are remorseful, and as a result you have voluntarily admitted your guilt, on all the offences;
(vi) You have been remanded in custody, since your first appearance in the Nasinu Magistrate Court ie. from 28th January 2011 to 15th March 2012 – approximately 1 year 1 month 15 days.

17. The aggravating factors were as follows:

(i) This was the worst type of sexual abuse that can ever happen to a family. You had no blood connection to the complainant. Your case involved a serious of breach of trust between a step grandfather and a granddaughter. The complainant was born on 10th October 1996. She stayed in her family's home, with her parents and grandmother. Her grandfather had passed on. In 1998, you moved into the complainant's family, by marrying her grandmother. The complainant's family accepted you. They trusted you. Little did they know that they were subjecting themselves to a conniving and deceitful person. When the complainant was 6 years old, you raped her in their very own house, while her parents were resting, and her grandmother away at the market. You secretly committed indecencies on her on various occasions, while pretending that everything was well in the family. You again raped her when she was 11 years old. Then you committed further indecencies on her until January 2011, when the matter was reported to police. You will certainly have to pay for what you have done to this child, and this family.

18. On the rape charge (Count No. 1), I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the sentence by 7 years to 18 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the sentence by 5 years to 13 years imprisonment. On count No. 1, I sentence you to 13 years imprisonment.

79539,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The appellant appeared before the Suva Magistrates’ Court on 1 February 2002 charged with five counts of rape. The particulars showed that the victim in each case was the same person and that the charges covered a period from December 1999 to February 2002. The appellant elected summary trial and pleaded guilty to all charges.

When the facts were presented to the court by the prosecution, it became apparent that the victim was the accused’s daughter, the rapes started when she was only 13 years old, the victim had been threatened and subjected to physical violence, on one occasion the appellant had taken her to a hotel to commit the offence and he had obtained her silence by a threat to kill her if she told anyone. The offences came to light when her mother noticed that she looked as if she may be pregnant and the victim disclosed the rapes and the identity of her attacker. A medical examination confirmed that she was a week over seven months pregnant.

The only indication in the original charges which might have alerted the court to the fact that the victim was the appellant’s daughter was that the victim had the same family name as the accused.

The appellant admitted the facts that had been outlined and also admitted two minor convictions both of which were more than 20 years old. Having passed in a copy of the appellant’s antecedent history, the prosecutor applied to the magistrate to commit the case to the High Court for sentencing under section 222 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

At that stage the magistrate indicated that he would hear the application after the appellant had mitigated. Once that was done and, following further submissions by the prosecutor, the magistrate’s notes recorded, inter alia:

”1. I will first rule on the prosecution application to refer this matter to the High Court for sentencing under section 222 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

2. I thank the prosecution for referring this court to the various authorities cited in the record. All those authorities are binding in this case. However, in my view, the Court of Appeal case of Timoci Momotu v State is crucial for the success or otherwise of the State’s application.
.......

4. Of importance is the requirement that this court must consider his character and antecedents of the accused supplied by the State. This is to be an added inquiry separate from his circumstances and gravity of the offences to which the accused has pleaded guilty to.
......

6. The antecedent of the accused supplied to the court by the prosecution does not entitle me to refer this matter to the High court for sentencing.

7. The antecedent of the accused appears to show that he is a first offender as far as sexual offences are concerned.

8. If the prosecution had wanted a penalty more than that allowed by the magistrates’ court, they should have used their powers under section 220 of the CPC at the outset.

9. It is not safe, given the legal difficulties presented by Timoci Momotu to rely on section 222 (1) of the CPC when the antecedent of the accused does not satisfy the test laid out in that case.
...

12. The facts of this case is very disturbing. The accused has seriously abused his right as a parent. He has seriously abused the trust his daughter placed in him. He has, in effect, ruined his family.”

He then sentenced the appellant 4 years imprisonment on count 1, 5 years consecutive on count 2 and 5 years concurrent on the remaining counts giving a total of 9 years.

The State appealed against conviction and sentence and the appeal was heard by Justice Shameem.

On conviction, the learned judge considered the The State v.Timoci Momotu, Crim App AAU18/94 and the authorities cited. She then concluded:

“Turning therefore to the case before me, the learned Magistrate held that the respondent was of good character and that the committal was not justified. I do not consider that he erred in ignoring the two previous convictions for the respondent. They are more than 20 years old and were rightly disregarded. However, I consider that he did err in disregarding the fact that respondent had raped his daughter (which was not alleged in the charge) and that the respondent had committed other offences of rape against his daughter which were not specified in the charges. According to the authorities I have cited, these factors were additional to the facts disclosed in the offences charged and were both relevant to the discretion to commit.

Given the starting point for rape, which is 7 years imprisonment, the gravity of the offence, including the resulting pregnancy of the complainant, would have justified a significant increase. Any reduction for the guilty plea could not have brought the sentence within the jurisdiction (on one count) of the magistrates’ court. Further the relationship between the respondent and the complainant and the on-going nature of the offending in relation to incidents not alleged in the charges, should have led to committal [for sentence].

I therefore find that the learned magistrate erred in failing to take into account factors relating to character and antecedents, and in refusing the State’s application to commit to the High Court for sentence.”

The learned judge then quashed the decision by the magistrate not to commit to the High Court for sentence and substituted such an order.

The appellant was unrepresented before this Court. He had put in written submissions which related to sentence only. We shall return to those when dealing with sentence. However, his grounds suggest he does not understand the procedure that was followed and so we have reviewed the decision of the learned High Court judge on appeal.

We are satisfied that the learned judge’s conclusions were correct. The effect of the requirement in section 222 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code that “... if on obtaining information as to [the accused’s] character and antecedents, the magistrate is of opinion that they are such that greater punishment should be inflicted in respect of the offence than the magistrate has power to inflict..” was extensively discussed in Momotu’s case. The Court cited the case of R v King’s Lynn Justices, ex parte Carter and others (1968) 3 All ER 858 in which Lord Parker CJ stated at 862:

“As I see it, ... the expression “character and antecedents” being as wide as it possibly can be, justices are entitled to take into consideration in deciding whether or not to commit, not merely previous convictions, not merely offences which they are asked to take into consideration, but matters revealed in the course of the case connected with the offence charged which reflects in any way on the accused’s character.”

The majority in Momotu considered that the sole reason for the magistrate’s decision to commit for sentence in that case was the gravity of the offence. Dillon JA, differed from the majority in finding that the gravity of the offence also provided information relating the character of the offender.

We agree that some facts may, in a particular case, point both to the gravity of the offence and to the character of the offender. In the present case the learned judge clearly formed that conclusion. The fact the rapes were committed on his own daughter, that she was a child at the time, that there were more instances than were actually charged, that they resulted in her becoming pregnant, that he was willing to use violence to facilitate the rapes and threats to procure her silence all supply information about the character of the appellant what was not apparent in the charges.

The decision of the learned judge to quash the magistrate's order and commit the case to the High Court for sentence was clearly correct.

When the case was brought up for sentence, the learned judge referred to the guidelines in Mohammed Kasim v The State Crim App 21/93 and sentenced the appellant in the following terms:

“Taking 7 years as the starting point, I increase that term by two years for the young age of the complainant and a further 3 years for the fact that she is your daughter. I add a further year for the resulting pregnancy. I reduce the term by one year for the guilty plea and other mitigation.”

She then sentenced the appellant to 12 years imprisonment on each court concurrent.

This court can only alter that sentence if it is manifestly excessive or wrong in law.

The appellant had placed a letter before the High Court from his family pleading for a non-custodial sentence. He submitted a further letter each from the complainant and from his wife. They repeat in strong terms their need for the appellant to be free to provide for his family and point out the suffering his incarceration will have on the family members. No court could fail to be moved by such letters but the duty of the court is to pass a sentence for the offence that is appropriate to its gravity. It must consider all matters that may mitigate the penalty but the consequences of the sentence on the accused man’s family cannot be properly taken into account. Clearly the learned judge would have been affected by that plea. It is impossible not to feel sympathy for the plight of the family as a result of a custodial sentence and to realise that the effect of the sentence will inevitably, in a case such as this, cause great hardship to the victim also.

We also bear that in mind but, in view of the guidelines in Mohammed Kasim, we cannot say that the sentence was manifestly excessive

In one aspect of the sentence however, we do consider the learned judge erred. It has long been the practice of the courts to reduce a sentence where the accused person has pleaded guilty. In most cases that is a recognition of his contrition as expressed by an early admission and the fact that it will save the witnesses and the court a great deal of time and expense. In offences of a sexual nature, the amount of reduction is generally more because the plea saves the victim from having to attend the trial and relive her experience in the witness box.

The learned trial judge, as had the magistrate, indicated that the sentence was reduced as a result of the plea of guilty by one year.

In this case, the learned judge was right to pass a sentence well above the starting point suggested in Mohammed Kasim and the total sentence arrived at was, as we have stated, unchallengeable. The facts of this case suggest that the appellant had little choice but to plead guilty and so the reduction such a plea would earn would not be as great as in many other cases. However, we feel that a reduction of one thirteenth does not adequately reflect the fact that his daughter was saved from having to give evidence. We feel that a reduction of approximately one sixth would reflect that more accurately and to that extent only do we feel the learned judge’s decision should be changed.

The appeal against sentence is allowed to the extent that the sentence is reduced to one of 11 years on each count to be served concurrently.

Before leaving this case we would make a further observation.

In a case where the accused has elected to be tried summarily, the court should always be careful, as the facts unfold, to bear in mind the possibility that the offences are too serious for him to be able to pass an adequate sentence. If he does he has the power at any stage to stop trying the case and to continue as a preliminary inquiry.

The prosecutor has the right to require the case to be tried in the High Court if he makes an application to that effect before the commencement of the trial. The prosecutor will know better than the magistrate the nature and seriousness of the offence and should always be prepared to make such an application in an appropriate case. If there is any doubt, the magistrate should be given the full facts before he makes a decision whether or not to proceed summarily. In this case, the prosecutor should have done so. Once he had let it proceed to trial, his ability to seek a committal for sentence under section 222 (1) could have been restricted by the terms of the section.

Quillam and Thompson JJA made this clear in Momotu’s case:

“In the present case, it must have become apparent to the Magistrate in the course of the trial, if not sooner, that this was the kind of case in which the maximum sentence of 5 years was unlikely to be sufficient, and particularly in view of the observations of this Court, made a few months earlier, that the starting point for sentencing for rape should now be 7 years (see Mohammed Kasim v. State FCA No. 21 of 1993, delivered 27 May 1994). No doubt there may still be cases in which a term of 5 years or less will be appropriate but they are likely to be increasingly rare.

We should also expect the prosecution to give closer attention to whether a rape trial should take place in the Magistrates Court or the High Court. While the charge must first be filed in the Magistrates Court it is open to the prosecution under s.220 to apply at once for a preliminary inquiry. The prosecution will be aware of the nature of the evidence to be offered and we consider that a deliberate decision should be made in each case to whether the case is one which is likely to attract a sentence of more than 5 years. In view of what we have already said we consider a decision to accept summary trial of a rape charge should rarely be made.”

We would suggest that all rape cases should be tried in the High Court. The reduction from the basic sentence needed to bring it within the magistrate’s jurisdiction is such that it will only be inappropriate in the most unusual case. Where the likelihood of committal to the High Court for sentence is so great, it is unfair to the accused to start to hear the case summarily and so, before embarking on such a trial, the magistrate should make careful inquiry of the prosecution as to the details of the case.

74535,"JUDGMENT

The Appellant was charged as follows:

First Count
Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED RAPE: Contrary to section 151 of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

RUSIATE BULIMAIWAI on the 24th day of February, 2003 at Suva in the Central Division, attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman namely FANIA SERU without her consent.

Second Count
Statement of Offence

COMMON ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 244 of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

RUSIATE BULIMAIWAI, on the 24th day of February, 2003 at Suva in the Central Division, unlawfully assaulted FANIA SERU.

He pleaded not guilty and was convicted on the 31st of March 2005. He was sentenced to a total of 2 years imprisonment. He now appeals against conviction and sentence.

The grounds of appeal are that there was no corroboration of the evidence of the complainant, the medical report on its own was inadequate to convict the Appellant, and the State failed to properly lead the evidence.

The case was first called on the 19th of June 2003. The Appellant pleaded not guilty on both counts. There were numerous adjournments to allow legal aid counsel to appear, and also for the non-appearance of witnesses. The trial commenced on the 17th of June 2004.

The evidence of the complainant was that on the 23rd and 24th of February 2003, she was working at the Dragon Night Club from 5pm to 3am. She went to the Birdland Nightclub for half an hour with her work mates and then went home to Nadera. She took a short cut from the Top Shop in Raiwaqa. As she walked past the Police Post, she saw the Appellant on the porch. He called out to her and asked her for cigarettes. She said she had known the Appellant for four years. He was wearing a police uniform because he was a Special Constable. She gave him cigarettes. The record then reads as follows:
“I gave him a roll of cigarettes when he held my hand. This happened inside the Police Post, when I went back to give him a roll of cigarette. When he held my hand, I told him, “Rusi cava manati iko”. He replied “tikolo madaga na gusumu lako mai ke.” He pulled me towards the porch, there is a door to the wash room, where he held me against the wall outside, pulled up my skirt. I called out “Rusi cava manati iko.” He replied “tikolo na gusumu, kua ni tovolea mo kaila, de’u na vacuki iko.” He then touched my private part. He put me on the floor bending down, and started to unbutton his trousers. I pushed him and warned him at the same time, that I shall report him to Michael, the father of my child, a daughter. When he heard of my warning he then released me.”

She said that to touch her private parts, the Appellant had lifted her underwear. She said she was distressed because she had always treated the Appellant like a brother. As she got up from the floor, the Appellant punched her.

She then complained about the incident to her brother, Apenisa Seru, who advised her to report the matter at the Raiwaqa Police Station. She did so. Two days later, the Appellant’s wife came to her home, seeking reconciliation. The complainant chased her away.

The Appellant was defended by counsel. She said she was not certain of the exact time of the incident. She said that before the incident, she had drunk four glasses of rum and coke.

The prosecution called Corporal Sakiusa Vunivesilevu of Raiwaqa Police Station. He said that on the 24th of February 2003, he received a report of attempted rape and indecent assault, by Fania Seru. He interviewed the Appellant under caution. The Appellant told him that the complainant came to the police post at 5.22am. She was drunk. He made an entry about her arrival in the Station Diary. He said that she spilt some water over the diary and that he asked her for a roll of cigarettes. She gave him a roll. She then started to fill an electric kettle with water, apparently with the intention of throwing water over him. He punched her on the mouth. The kettle fell down. He told her to leave the Post. She left, but she came back to say that she would report him. He denied trying to rape her or indecently assault her.

The trial continued on the 5th of November 2004. The complainant’s brother was the next witness. He said that on the 24th of February 2003, at 5.30am the complainant woke him up crying and told him that the Appellant had tried to rape her at the Police Post that morning. He told her to report the matter. Under cross-examination he said he could see bruises on his sister’s mouth and that she did not smell of alcohol.

Police Support Officer Jitendra Singh gave evidence that he was on duty at the Police Post from 6.45am to 4pm on the 24th of February. He said that when he took over from the Appellant, the Appellant told him that he had slapped the complainant when she tried to put on the kettle and when she spilt water on the station diary.

The trial was then adjourned again, and continued on the 1st of March 2005. The prosecution closed its case. The Appellant gave sworn evidence which was similar to his caution statement. Under cross-examination he denied attempting to have sexual intercourse with the complainant. However he also said that he did not assault her, but that the kettle accidentally hit her mouth when he tried to slap her from throwing water on him.

Judgment was delivered on the 31st of March 2005. After reviewing the evidence he said that an attempted rape is complete even if the perpetrator voluntarily desisted, as long as there has been a proximate act. He found that in this case the Appellant’s acts were sufficiently proximate on the basis of the evidence of the complainant and convicted him accordingly on both counts.

Mitigation was heard on the 4th of April 2005. The Appellant himself mitigated, saying that he did not commit the offence and that he was a 29 year old married man with a child. The learned Magistrate sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment on Count 1, and 9 months (concurrent) on Count 2.

The appeal

The Appellant says that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the complainant’s evidence and that the convictions were therefore unsafe. The Court of Appeal decision in Seremaia Balelala Crim. App. AAU0003 of 2004S has recently removed the necessity for giving a corroboration warning in cases of sexual assault. This is because the law of corroboration was based on the discriminatory premise, that the evidence of women in sexual cases, is inherently unreliable. Thus, there was no need to look for corroboration of the complainant’s evidence.

Clearly, the learned Magistrate accepted the complainant’s evidence. It is unfortunate that he did not explain why he preferred her evidence over the Appellant’s, but the way in which he set it out in full, and the contradictions apparent in the record when the Appellant was giving evidence, make the reasons for his decision self-apparent. The complainant’s evidence was given logically. She did not contradict herself. The bruise on her mouth was consistent with both her evidence, and the Appellant’s. However, the Appellant had given two different explanations for it. There is evidence that the complainant was distressed immediately after the incident and there is evidence of recent complaint which is consistent with her account of the incident. It is therefore unsurprising that the court preferred her evidence.

In relation to the medical report, I note that although the prosecution tried to tender it from the bar table, the defence objected and asked for the doctor to be called. The court agreed and thereafter, although the doctor did not give evidence, the court placed no weight at all on the medical report. Nor did counsel seek to call the doctor for the defence.

The last ground of appeal is that this was not a case of attempted rape but one of indecent assault, even on the evidence of the complainant. Although this ground was not specifically raised in the letter of appeal, I am considering it because the Appellant is not represented by counsel. Further, this ground raises important issues of law which warrant determination.

Section 380 of the Penal Code provides as follows:
“When a person, intending to commit an offence, begins to put his intention into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment, and manifests his intention by some overt act, but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence, he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence.

It is immaterial, except so far as regards punishment, whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence, or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will, or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention.

It is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to the offender it is impossible in fact to commit the offence.”

The elements of the offence of attempted rape are first that the accused intended to have carnal knowledge without consent, and second that he did some overt act to put his intention into execution. Often the intent to rape is implied from the nature of the overt act. A touching of the breasts may only constitute an indecent assault. An attempt to take off underclothes together with a touching of the breasts may constitute a sufficient overt act. A great deal depends on the circumstances of each case.

The “overt acts” in this case were the holding of the complainant’s hand, the pulling of the complainant towards the porch, the holding of the complainant against the wall, the pulling up of her skirt, the touching of her private parts, the pushing of the complainant to the floor, and the Appellant’s act of bending down and unbuttoning of his trousers. Together with these acts, he told her to keep her mouth shut and “to come here” and to shut her mouth or he would punch her. He only desisted when she threatened to tell the father of her daughter, a fellow police officer. All that was left for the Appellant to do, was to attempt a penetration. His aggressive conduct makes it clear that he was doing what he was doing despite her lack of consent to that conduct.

In Hari Chand v. State Crim. App. 03 of 2005LAB, I found that where the Appellant pushed the victim onto a bed, lifted up her dress, pulled down his own trousers and put his hand over her mouth when she struggled, accompanied by a request for sexual intercourse, there was sufficient evidence to prove both the overt acts and the intention to rape. It is essentially a question of fact whether the offender’s acts are sufficiently overt or proximate (R v. Patnaik [2000] 3 Archbold News 2).

On the basis of the complainant’s evidence, there was ample proof of an intention to rape and of overt acts which manifested that intention. It is irrelevant that he desisted of his own motion. He had already committed the overt acts with the necessary mens rea. The offence was complete. This was not a case of indecent assault.

The learned Magistrate’s judgment makes it apparent that he considered the necessary elements of the offence of attempted rape, and correctly directed himself on those elements.

The appeal against convictions is dismissed. The Appellant did not pursue his appeal against sentence. However the 2 year term of imprisonment is within the tariff for attempted rape and is not manifestly excessive. In Joji Aunima v. State Cr. App. 33/2000, I identified the tariff for attempted rape as being 12 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. Sentences at the upper end of the tariff should be imposed where gratuitous violence is inflicted, where a weapon is used, where there is a gross breach of trust or where there is a large age gap between complainant and offender. In Hari Chand v. State (supra) I upheld a 3 year term for the attempted rape of his daughter-in-law by the offender. There was no gratuitous violence but there was a gross breach of trust.

In this case, the 2 year term imposed is at the lower end of the tariff. Although the Appellant was of previous good character, the offence involved a gross breach of trust. He was a police officer in uniform. He was also well-known to the victim. I do not take into account the punch he delivered because he was charged separately for it on Count 2. The sentence was therefore correct in principle.

This appeal is wholly dismissed.

246642,"SENTENCE
  
• DAVENDRA SHARMA , you were charged with one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.
 
• You pleaded guilty for this charge and admitted on 06/02/2016 after an argument slapped your wife on her left eye. 
 
• The learned defence counsel in his comprehensive written mitigation is asking for a non-conviction based on your employment and your future. 
 
• It has been held that non-conviction would be given only for morally blameless people or technical breaches (State v Nayacalagilagi (2009) FJHC 73; HAC165.2007 (17th March 2009), Guidelines by his Lordship Chief Justice Gates in State v Batiratu [2012] FJHC 864; HAR001.2012 (13 February 2012). You do not fall in to any of these categories
 
• . Further the article 26 of the 2013 Constitution states that every person is equal before the law. Therefore there should not be special treatment for you when charged with a domestic violence offence that would not be applicable to ordinary person. Accordingly I convict you for this offence. 

The Law and the Tariff 
  
• The maximum penalty for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
• In State v Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78; HAC025S.2008S (29 April 2008) her Ladyship justice Shameem said :

“The tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment.”
  
• In Koroivuki v. State[2013] FJCA 15; AAU 0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Suresh Chandra said:

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.""
 
  
• As for the starting point the UK Sentencing Guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non-domestic context. Therefore the starting point should be same irrespective of whether the parties are known to each other. 
 
• Considering the gravity of offending I select 06 months as the starting point for your sentence. 
 

Aggravating Factors 
  
• In UK Guidelines following are considered as aggravating factors in domestic violence cases :  
• Abuse of trust and abuse of power ;
 
• Victim is particularly vulnerable ;
 
• Impact on children; 
 
• Using contact arrangements with a child to instigate an offence ;
 
• A proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting; 
 
•  history of disobedience to court orders; 
 
• Victim forced to leave home .

 
• When sentencing for a domestic violence a court in Fiji can consider the above aggravating factors and any other factors that would further aggravate the offence. 
 
• In this case I find abuse of trust as aggravating factor and add 03 months to reach 09 months imprisonment. 

Mitigating Factors 
  
• In UK Guidelines the positive good character and provocation are considered as mitigating factors. 
 
• In this case even though your counsel is saying you were provoked by your wife summary of facts states that she was inquiring about your extra marital affair which led to this assault. Therefore I do not find any provocation in this case . 
 
• But I consider your past good behavior and personal mitigating factors (married with a child, co-operated with the police and remorseful) as mitigating this offence and deduct 03 months to reach 06 months imprisonment. 

Guilty Plea 
  
• In Naikelekevesi v The State Criminal Appeal No AAU 0061 of 2007 it was observed :

“...where there is a guilty plea , this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factors in a case”. 
  
• In UK Guilty Plea guidelines of 2007 it has been held that when an accused pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity the reduction is 1/3 and after a trial date is set 1/4 recommended. But when an accused pleaded guilty at the door of the court or after the trial has started he maybe entitle for only 1/10 discount. 
 
• Having obtained the proper legal advice you pleaded guilty and for that I deduct 1/3 to reach 04 months imprisonment. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend this sentence. You have informed that you have reconciled with the victim and she has written a letter trying to withdraw this complaint. Further you saved the time and resources of this court by pleading guilty and you have unblemished character apart from this incident. 
 
• Therefore allowing you a chance to reform I suspend this 04 months to 02 years. 
 
• If you commit any offence during next 02 years you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
• For the safety of the complainant I also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

On 27th January 2014 in the afternoon at about 1pm, Talat Mahamood (hereinafter referred to as the ""accused""); 35 years visited, Hamida, (hereinafter referred to as the ""deceased""), 53 years, domestic duties, at the deceased house at Nakavu settlement in Nadi. The accused is the nephew and neighbor of the deceased. The accused visited the deceased to inform the deceased of his relationship with the deceased daughter. The deceased was in her sitting room cutting vegetables when the accused approached her.

The accused informed the deceased that her daughter is out of control and a heated argument arose between the accused and the deceased. During the argument, the accused slapped the deceased twice on the face and he got hold of the deceased mouth which led to the falling of the false teeth of the deceased on the floor. The deceased then stabbed the accused on his right palm from the knife she was using in cutting the vegetables. The accused got wild and then he forcefully got hold of the kitchen knife from the deceased and started stabbing the deceased on the neck, stomach and hands for several times. While the accused was stabbing the deceased, the knife broke and the knife blade was stuck in the deceased's neck.

The accused got hold of another kitchen knife which was on the floor and stabbed the deceased again on the stomach for several times. The deceased was bleeding heavily in the sitting room and after he noticed that the deceased was motionless he then dragged the deceased in to the kitchen and hides the deceased's body under the table and placed some tyres on top of the body. The accused then started cleaning the sitting room by mopping the blood stains and re-arrange everything in the sitting room in order.

At about 5.30 pm, the deceased son, Riaz Ali, 20 years, was about to enter their house when he noticed the accused was sitting on the sofa in the sitting room. As Mr Riaz Ali was about to enter the sitting room, the accused stopped him from entering and he gave Mr Riaz Ali $15 to go and buy some beer. Mr Riaz Ali refused to go and he forced himself inside their house and then he went to the kitchen and saw his mother, the deceased, lying under the table with three tyres were placed on top of her. Mr Riaz Ali returned to the sitting room and saw the accused ran away from the house towards the main road.

The accused went to Imam Taxis and tours and then he hired a taxi to take him to Wailoaloa. The accused got off at Wailoaloa beach where he was hiding until he was arrested by Police on 29th January 2014. The matter was then reported to the Police and the deceased body was later conveyed to Nadi Hospital. A post-mortem was conducted on the deceased on 29th January 2014 by Dr Ponnu Swamy Goundar. The post mortem report revealed that there was excessive loss of blood from several minor blood vessels of the neck due to stab injuries.

The accused was then taken to Nadi Police Station on 29th January 2014 and was interviewed under caution whereby he admitted that he stabbed the deceased on the neck and stomach several times. At the time of the offence the accused was reckless as to causing the death of the deceased by stabbing the deceased several times on the deceased neck and stomach.

	1.	After carefully considering the Plea of you to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for one count of Murder contrary to Section 237 (1) of the Crimes Decree.

	2.	Accused Talat Mahamood you stand convicted for one count of Murder.

	3.	The mandatory sentence fixed by law for Murder is that the convicted person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. There is no discretion allowed to the Court in a murder case to sentence to a lesser term.

	4.	It is well known that convicted persons sentenced to life imprisonment usually do not serve the full term, that is serve imprisonment for the rest of their lives

	5.	In State v Momo [2012] FJHC 1093; HAC 086.2011 (18 May 2012) Hon. Mr. Justice Temo had discussed this issue in detail. 

""Murder"" is a serious offence, and it is often said, to be at the top of the criminal calendar. It carries a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment. (Section 237, Crime Decree 2009). The court has the power to fix a non-parole period to be served, before a prisoner is eligible for parole. Case precedents show that the non-parole period for murder varies widely, depending on the peculiar facts of the case. In Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji, on 5 counts of murder and 1 of attempted murder, the accused was given 19 years non-parole period on each murder count, and 10 years consecutive on a pending prison sentence, total non-parole period was 26 years. In State v Niume & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 010 of 2010, High Court, Suva, on 2 counts of murder, Accused No. 1 was given 25 years non-parole period for the murder counts. In State v Ashwin Chand, Criminal Case No. HAC 032 of 2005, High Court, Lautoka, on a count of murder, the accused was given a non-parole period of 22 years. In State v Navau Lebobo, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2002, High Court, Suva, the non-parole period was 20 years. Twenty years non-parole period were also imposed in the following three cases: State v Anesh Ram, Criminal Case No. HAC 124 of 2008S, High Court, Suva; The State v Bharat Lal & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 061 of 2009S, High Court, Suva; The State v Balekivuya, Criminal Case No. 095 of 2010S, High Court, Suva. In State v Tukana, Criminal Case No. HAC 021 of 2009, High Court, Lautoka, the non-parole period was 11 years. The non-parole period imposed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

	1.	Aggravating factors;
		(i) Use of a weapon
		(ii) Nature of injuries on the deceased
		(iii) The age and the vulnerable nature of the deceased

	2.	Mitigating circumstances:
		(i) You are first offender 
		(ii) You pleaded guilty to the offence
		(iii) You are remorseful 
		(iv) You were in remand from 29th January 2014 

	3.	After weighing the aggravating factors against the mitigating circumstances of this case, I fix a non-parole period of 15 years acting under Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

	4.	Therefore you are sentenced for life imprisonment and not eligible for parole till completing 15 years imprisonment.

	5.	30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal with leave from that Court.

	1.	JIUTA QESA BALEKANA, you were charged with three counts of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Crime Decree No 44 of 2009. Since the victim is a minor her name is suppressed and identified as XY.

	2.	You waived right to counsel and pleaded guilty for the three counts before my sister magistrate Ms. George. When this came before me the learned counsel from the Legal Aid and you had no objection for me to give the sentence.

	3.	Therefore your plea was taken again on 02/09/2013 and you pleaded guilty again for all the counts. You also admitted the summary of facts.

	4.	According to the summary of facts on 18, 19 and 20 March you pulled down the pants of XY and touched her vagina.

	5.	I am satisfied you fully understand the legal effects of your plea. Therefore I convict you for these three counts. 

LAW AND TARIFF

	1.	Maximum penalty for this offence is 05 years imprisonment. In RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S Shameem J held that ""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type""

	2.	Upon considering the summary of facts in this case I select 12 months imprisonment as the starting point for each count. 

Aggravating factors

	1.	The victim is your first cousin's daughter. You breached the trust. She was 03 years old and vulnerable person. For these I add 10 months to reach 22 months for each count. 
Mitigating factors

	1.	I consider following mitigating factors which were brought before me in the mitigation submission filed by the learned counsel.
	I.	41 years old 
	II.	Single 
	III.	Seeking forgiveness from court
	IV.	First offender
	V.	Supports family. 

	2.	I deduct 06 months for the above mitigating factors to reach the period of 16 months.

	3.	Since you have pleaded guilty in the first available instance you are entitled for a reduction of 1/3 of the total period of imprisonment. (Akili Vilimone v State). There by your sentence stands for 10 months. 

	4.	I am mindful that under section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I can suspend a sentence which is below two years.

	5.	The learned counsel from the Legal Aid asked for a non custodial sentence. You have committed these on her three occasions . At that time she was 03 years old and was vulnerable. From your mitigating factors also I do not see any reason to suspend the sentence. Also the sentence would be a message to others who try to commit offences like these against the children in this country. 

	6.	Accordingly I decline to suspend your sentence. You are sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for each count to be served concurrently. 

	7.	Also this Court grants a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non molestation conditions in favor of the victim.

	8.	28 days to appeal

80351,"SENTENCE

[1] Sant Kumar, you freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty to act with intent to cause grievous harm after the charge was reduced from attempted murder and to escaping from lawful custody. I convict you of both charges.

[2] The facts are that you were in a de facto relationship with the victim. On 10 August 2010, the victim left your home in Lautoka and returned to her mother's home in Bulileka, Labasa after an argument. The following day, you followed her to Labasa with the intention to persuade her to return home with you. On the morning of 13 August 2010, you had an argument with the victim when she refused to return with you to Lautoka. You grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed the victim once just below her left shoulder. She screamed. You ran away.

[3] The victim was taken to the hospital by her family. She sustained a wound on her left shoulder. The wound was 1.5 cm in length and less than 2 cm in depth. The wound was not life threatening but the victim was kept under observation in the hospital for five days. 

[4] On 14 August 2010, you attempted to commit a suicide by hanging yourself at a schoolbus shelter. You were rescued by some members of the public, who alerted the police afterwards. The police transported you to the hospital. You sustained abrasions and swells around your neck. After medical examination, you were kept in the hospital under police guard. 

[5] On 15 August 2010, you sneaked out of the hospital without the police guard's knowledge. You were apprehended on the same day at Bulileka and returned to the hospital. You remained in the hospital until 19 August 2010 when the police took you for questioning. In your interview, you admitted stabbing the victim.

[6] On 21 August 2010, you were charged with stabbing the victim with a knife. You made a statement to the police that you felt sorry for the victim after stabbing her. You thought she would die and that is why you tried to commit a suicide. 

[7] You are 42 years old and married with children. You are a bus driver by profession and you are the sole breadwinner for your family. Your three children are attending school. 

[8] The victim's mother gave evidence of the financial assistance you gave to her family before the stabbing incident. In mitigation, your counsel informs the court that the victim visited you several times while you were in custody on remand. You say that the victim has forgiven you. However, there is no confirmation of this from the victim. 

[9] A more compelling mitigating factor in your favour is that you are a first time offender. In the last 42 years you have lived a blameless life. 

[10] The offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is punishable by life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for escaping from lawful custody is two years imprisonment. Both offences arise from the same facts, and therefore deserving concurrent sentences. 

[11] Your counsel has referred to numerous cases, to persuade the court to impose a suspended sentence. I bear in mind that sentences are imposed based on the facts of each case. 

[12] The most helpful guideline case for the offence of intent to cause grievous harm is the decision of Shameem J in State v Mokubula [2003] FJHC 164. In that case, Shameem J held that the tariff for act with intent to cause grievous harm is between 6 months to 5 years imprisonment, and that in case of an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years, depending on the nature of the weapon.

[13] By assaulting your de facto partner, you clearly breached her trust. The fact that the stabbing arose from a domestic dispute aggravates the offence. Your subsequent attempt to commit a suicide demonstrates to me that you have fatal obsession towards the victim.

[14] The mitigating factors are your guilty pleas, confession to the police, remorse, previous good character and family circumstances.

[15] For the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm, I pick 2 years imprisonment as my starting point. I increase the sentence to 3 years to reflect the aggravating factors. I reduce the sentence to 12 months to reflect the mitigating factors and the remand period of 37 days. 

[16] I sentence you to 12 months imprisonment for act with intent to cause grievous harm and to 1 month imprisonment for escaping from lawful custody, to be served concurrently.

[17] I now consider whether to suspend your sentence. Suspension of sentence is generally reserved for a first time and a young offender. Although you are a first time offender, you are not a young offender.

[18] The offences arose from a domestic relationship where the vulnerable partner was stabbed with a knife. The court has a duty to denounce your conduct and to deter you and others from committing this kind of offences. Domestic arguments are inevitable in relationships. Men must restrain themselves from using violence on their partners during domestic arguments. Despite your previous good character and other compelling mitigating factors, I give priority to the principle of deterrence and have decided not to suspend your terms of imprisonment.

[19] Since you are now convicted of a domestic violence offence, I am bound by the Domestic Violence Decree to issue a restraining order against you to protect the victim from any form of violence in future by you. I order you to stay away from the victim in future and you must not commit any form of assault or threat on her in future. The victim may apply to the High Court to have this restraining order discharged or varied.

1. You, Shankaran Gounder, are here, to be sentenced on admission of guilt on your own accord for the following offence namely:

Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm: Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

I am satisfied with your plea is unequivocal and that you understand the repercussion of your plea. 

2. According to the facts, (which you have admitted), on 21-02-2011, Victim (PW 1) is your wife was at home after work at about 1830 hrs. You were drinking at home at that time. You asked your wife to drink but she refused to join. She had a bath and she went to bed. Then at about 2000 hrs you approached her, sat on her stomach and then you started punching her on face. Thereby she was sustained left and right eye's injuries. PW1 managed to escape and ran to her neighbours place. This matter was reported to the Police and Victim was hospitalised for treatments. 

3. Maximum penalty could be imposed for this offence is five years imprisonment.

4. It was held in State v Tugalala [[2008] FJHC 78; HAC025S.2008S (29 April 2008), the tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. As cited in earlier case, in Elizabeth Joseph v. The State [2004] HAA 030/04S and State v. Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA073/04S, that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence. The use of a pen knife for instance, justifies a higher starting point. Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld (in Amasai Korovata v. The State [2006] HAA 115/06S.

Aggravating Factors of the offence

5. Following facts were revealed by the summary of facts placed before the court and will be considered as aggravating factors.

- deliberate assault
-cause injuries to the victim
-domestic violence 

6. Medical Examination form reveals that the complainant of this case has sustained three injuries. 

7- In my view, you have committed this crime with anger and under the influence of liquor. Anger does not produce anything apart from the violence and peril of your life and others' lives. In general it may cause your and other peoples' life miserable. But fortunately this case has not led up to that much. 

8. You pleaded guilty for the charge at the first instance. Therefore, you are entitled for reduction of your sentence. You have reconciled with your wife that is the complainant of this case and she confirmed before this court but with conditions. Domestic violence is a serious offence and pervades all over the world. Thousands of innocent victims have been battered daily and lamentably most of incidences are not reported to legal authorities. Offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is a reconcilable offence. But this court notes the offence that you have committed comes within the purview of section 3 (1) and (2) of Domestic Violence Decree 33 of 2009. In that event it cannot be reconciled under section 154(6) of Criminal Procedure Decree No 43 of 2009. Hence, your reconciliation of the victim, with your wife has no legal effect and it should be turned down. 

Mitigating Factors

9. In mitigation, you said that you are 50 years old, married with 4 children. You are self employed. You earn $100 per week. You reconciled with the complainant. . You are asking forgiveness and leniency of this court. You are a first offender.

10. Victim is your wife and you treated her in bad manner. Though she is your wife you have no legal right to beat her. The innocent wife came before court and consented to reconciliation subject to condition namely you should be in sober every day. Your drunkenness has caused their life in misery. Did you get any sort of relief from drinking alcohols? I do not think, you are addicted to alcohols and it deteriorated your health conditions and others safety of their lives. They do not have peace of mind because of your incorrigible habit. As I mentioned in Paragraph 3 you could have sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and that is the intention of Parliament to punish this kind of offenders. If I sentence you will lose family atmosphere. Since you have reconciled considering all factors, I select to adopt an alternate sentence. Thus I think it is inappropriate to consider custodial sentence in this matter. Therefore I am not setting a starting point for this offence. This court hopes this order enables you to contribute a peaceful homely atmosphere within your family life. This is the final chance that you are given and you are severely warned not to re-offend. 

11. Therefore, I proceed to adjourn the proceedings of this case for 03 years in accordance with the guidelines set out in sec. 44(2) and (3) of the Sentencing and Penalty Decree 2009. You are bound over for sum of $ 2000 for next 03 years to maintain good behaviour and peace. I impose following conditions on you. 

01. You should not harass mentally or physically to your wife, children or any other family member.

02. You should not come home after liquor. You should be in sober habits. 

03. You should not commit any offence whatsoever

04. You are ordered to report to Nasinu Police station last Sunday of every month between 6am to 6pm during this three years period.

You are further warned that if you commit any offence during this three years period you are liable to pay the above-mentioned bond to the court. You are hereby released, upon your undertaking to maintain good behaviour and peace for three years subjected to following further conditions.

12. At the expiry of three years, you are ordered to furnish an ""all clearance report"" to the court from the nearest police station to prove that you were in good behaviour and peace for last three years. At the time of expiry of three years, that report should be produced to the Senior Court Officer at Nasinu Magistrate Court to file of record and proceedings to be terminated and you will be discharged under the section 44(6) of the Sentencing and Penalty decree 2009 accordingly. 

13. Senior Court officer is directed to give a copy of this order to accused wife and if the accused breach one or more of these conditions, she could report it to the court through Senior Court Officer or officer in charge of the nearest police station and accused will be punished accordingly. 

14. 28 days to appeal.

Particulars of Offence
 
IANE RUPETI between the 1st January 2015 and 15th May 2015 at Rotuma in the Eastern Division had carnal knowledge of ES, without her consent.
 
  
• You and your wife were the guardians of the victim since she was 6 years old. In June 2011, your wife came to Fiji for the delivery of the second child leaving the victim under your care and protection. Thereafter, you approached the 13-year-old victim one night while she was asleep and then you raped her after you told her not to make a noise. You threatened her that the family bond will be over if she complains to anyone. After that first incident, you had raped her on several occasions in 2011 and then in 2015.
 
 
• The age difference between you and the victim is 45 years. You were her father figure during the time you raped her. The victim looked up to you for her care and protection. You were in a position of authority and trust and you have abused that position. As the victim said in her evidence, you have ruined her life.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (“Crimes Decree”) read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of a child victim is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), reads thus;

“If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.”
 
  
• The three offences you are convicted of forms a series of offences of the same character. Therefore, I consider it appropriate to apply the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree to impose an aggregate sentence for the three rape counts.
 
 
• I select 12 years imprisonment as the starting point of your aggregate sentence in respect of the three rape counts.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• you abused your position of authority and trust;
 
• the age gap between you and the victim which is 45 years; and
 
• you exploited the victim’s vulnerability.
 

 
• You have no previous convictions. Your previous good character will be considered as a mitigating factor.
 
 
• Your counsel highlighted the following as your personal circumstances; 
• you are 64 years old and a farmer by profession; and
 
• you have 9 children.

 
• Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, your sentence is increased by 4 years and I deduct 2 years of your sentence considering your mitigating factor.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to an aggregate sentence of 14 years imprisonment for the three counts of rape. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 11 years of your sentence in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• I note that you have spent around 2 months and 2 weeks in remand in connection with this case. I order that the time you spent in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you in terms of the provisions of section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 3 months.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 14 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. Considering the time spent in custody, the time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 13 years and 09 months
 
Non-parole period – 10 years and 09 months
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

 (ii) You have then taken her to two night clubs. Later in the night you have taken her into a dead end of a road. You have parked your car in a bush. You have threatened the complainant with death and also of assault with clenched fist;
 
 (iii) Thereafter, you have forcibly inserted your finger into her vagina. You also have had vaginal intercourse with her forcibly. You continued with your act, ignoring her pleas.
 

[5] According to Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, the maximum punishment for rape is imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence.
 
 
[6] The tariff for rape of an adult is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates (as he was then) in State v Marawa  [2004] FJHC 338. The starting point of imprisonment for rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is between 7 years to 15 years.
 
 
[7] In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; of 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed thus:
 
 
""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
 
[8] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, Suresh Chandra J, in Laisiasa Koroivuki v State (Criminal Appeal AAU 0018 of 2010) has formulated the following guiding principles; 
 
 
""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range"".
 
 
[9] Considering the nature of offending, and in the light of the above guiding principles, I commence your sentence at 8 years and 6 months of imprisonment each for the two counts of Rape.
 
 
[10] The aggravating factors are:
 
 
(i) Breach of trust the victim had towards you;
 
(ii) Significant degree of opportunistic planning;
 
(iii) Taking advantage of the victim's vulnerability;
 
(iv) Display of total disregard to the victim's wellbeing.
 
 
[11] I add 2 years 6 months for each count on the above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 11 years.
 
 
[12] The mitigating factors are:
 
 
 (i) You are a first offender; 
 (ii) You are a 33 year old taxi driver;
 (iii) You are married and supports your wife and child;
 (iv) No significant injury on victim;
 (v) No weapon was used on the victim;
 (vi) You co-operated with the Police investigations.
 

[13] I deduct 3 years for the above mitigating factors. Now the sentence is 8 years. 
 
 
[14] You were in remand for this case for almost a month.
 
 
[15] I deduct your month long remand period from the sentence and now the sentence is 7 years and 11 months for each count.
 
 
[16] In applying totality principle to your sentence, I direct that both these sentences to run concurrently.
 
 
[17] Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 6 years of non-parole period in view of the unreported judgement of Court of Appeal in Paula Tora v The State Crim App. No. AAU 0063/2011.
 
 
[18] Your final sentence is as follows:
 
 
 (i) For each count of Rape – 7 years and 11 months of imprisonment, to run concurrently.
 

Summary
 
 
[19] You are sentenced to 7 years and 11 months of imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 6 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[20] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

247240,"SENTENCE
 
  
• ROHIT RAJ , you were convicted after a trial to one count of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Penal Code. 
 
 
• The Prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that on 02nd August 2011 you indecently assaulted the complainant by touching her breast. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for this offence under the Crimes Decree is 05 years imprisonment. In the Penal Code the identical offence under the section 154(1) carried similar penalty and therefore the tariff applied under the Penal Code is still valid for this offence. 
 
 
• In RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S madam Justice Shameem held that 
 

""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type""
 
  
• Considering gravity of offending I select 02 years as the starting point. 
 
 
• There are no aggravating factors and therefore I would not enhance your sentence. 
 
 
• Mitigating factors as submitted by the learned defence counsel are 31 years old, single, sole bread winner and first offender and for these I deduct 06 months to reach 18 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• Now I would consider whether to suspend this sentence as urged by the defence . You are a first offender and promised not to reoffend. Also the age of the parties are similar and this can be considered as non-penetrative assault. 
 
 
• Therefore for the purpose of reform I suspend this 18 months imprisonment to 03 years. If you commit any offences during next 03 years you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

Introduction
 
 
 (3) The appellant had been charged in the High Court of Suva for one count of rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act. Consequent to the plea of not guilty entered by the appellant, the matter proceeded to hearing. The prosecution proposed to adduce the record of the caution interview in evidence, for which the appellant objected. Hence the voir dire hearing was conducted on the 7th of October 2013. The learned trial judge on the same day ruled that the caution interview of the appellant is admissible in evidence. The hearing of the substantive charge also commenced on the same day of 7th of October 2013 and concluded on the 9th of October 2013. The prosecution adduced the evidence of five witnesses, including the complainant. Subsequently, the appellant and one witness gave evidence for the defence. The learned counsel for the prosecution and the defence then made their respective closing addresses on the 9th of October 2013. The learned trial judge delivered his summing up on the 11th of October 2013. The three assessors returned with mixed opinions, where two of them found in their respective opinions that the appellant was not guilty for this offence and one assessor found him guilty. The learned trial judge in his judgment dated 11th of October 2013, dissenting with the majority opinion of the assessors, found the appellant guilty for the offence as charged and convicted him accordingly. The appellant was then sentenced to seven (7) years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five (5) years on the 8th of November 2013. 
 
 (4) Aggrieved with the said conviction, the appellant has filed a timely leave to appeal application to the Fiji Court of Appeal on the following grounds, which I reproduce verbatim as follows:
  
• The learned Judge erred in law when he shifts the burden of proof to the appellant by requiring the appellant to prove his innocent in the Judgment through his credibility and forthrightness in responding to questions in cross examination,
 
 
• The learned judge erred in law when he failed to include in his summing up and also properly consider the evidence under cross examination of PW2 namely Mereani who was the aunty of the complainant and are as follows; 
  
• She agreed that the complainant was shocked to see her, 
 
• She agreed that when the complainant came down to the foot of the hill near the cave to where she stood, the complainant had a guilty look, 
 
• She agreed that she only beat the complainant after she was asking the complainant and the complainant was not saying anything, 
 

 
• The learned trial judge erred in law and in fact when he did not direct the assessors on the complainant’s evidence which was given on oath where she agreed that only after she was sacked by the aunty, she then begun to talk a bit.
 

 (5) The respondent also filed notice of appeal and advanced the following grounds against the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge, that:
  
• The sentence is manifestly lenient having regards to the Sentencing guidelines and applicable tariff for the rape of a child, 

 
• The period spent in remand is not a mitigating factor, 
 

 (6) The single judge of the Court of Appeal in his ruling dated 15th of January 2015, refused to grant leave to the appeal against the conviction as sought by the appellant and also refused to grant leave to the appeal against sentence as advanced by the respondent. 
 
 (7) The appellant then renewed his appeal against the conviction on the same grounds pursuant to Section 35 (3) of the Court of Appeal Act. Accordingly, this court heard the respective oral submissions on the 24th of August 2017 and considered the written submissions of the appellant and the respondent. The learned counsel for the respondent informed the court on the date of the hearing that the respondent also renews his appeal against the sentence.
 

Factual Background 
 
 
 (8) The respondent alleged that the appellant on the 5th of May 2011, met the complainant at the Bilo gun site as she came to return the keys of his house. He then offered to take her on a site seeing visit around the gun site. The appellant then pulled her into a cave and forcefully removed her clothes. Subsequently, he undressed himself and forcefully had sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent. 
 
 (9) The appellant denied this allegation, though he admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant on the 5th of May 2011 at the gun site. He claimed that it was a consensual sexual intercourse. 
 

Ground One
 
 
 (10) Having briefly discussed the factual and procedural background of this appeal, I now turn to the first ground of appeal that is founded on the contention that the learned judge has shifted the burden of proof to the appellant in his judgment. 
 
 (11) The submissions of the appellant pertaining to this ground of appeal is mainly focused on the paragraph twelve of the judgment, where his Lordship has stated that:
 

 “Coupled with the above, the way the accused re-acted to being cross-examined by the prosecutor after giving sworn evidence, did not put him in a good light. I observed him to be a very evasive witness. He evaded most of the questions thrown by the prosecution. He was not forthright, leading me to the conclusion that he was not a credible witness. Had he been forthright with his answers, I would possibly have reached a different conclusion.”
 
 
 (12) According to Section 237 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Act, the Judgment of the court encompasses the summing up, the decision of the court, together with the reasons for differing with the majority opinion of the assessor. 
 (13) The Supreme Court of Fiji in Ram v State [2012] FJSC 12; CAV0001.2011 (9 May 2012) has expounded the scope of Section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Act, emphasizing the duty of the judge to provide reasons, if he disagrees with the majority opinion of the assessors in an inclusive manner. Justice Marsoof held ( at para 79) that:
 

 “After the Criminal Procedure Ordinance No. 23 of 1875 introduced a system of a trail by a judge sitting with assessors as an alternative to trial by jury with respect to certain selected categories of cases involving the native population, trial by jury was abolished altogether by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Ordinance No. 35 of 1961. The system of trial by a judge and assessors differs in one important aspect from trial by jury, as unlike under the jury system, even the unanimous opinion of the assessors does not bind the trial judge, who is free in appropriate cases, to differ and pronounce his own verdict. Section 84 of the Ordinance of 1875 simply provided that "".......the opinion of each assessor shall be given orally.........but the decision shall be vested exclusively in the judge"" but section 299(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 21, which was in force at the time of the High Court trial in 2008, expressly provided that the trial judge ""shall not be bound to conform to the opinions of the assessors"". According to the proviso to the said sub-section, when the trial judge disagrees with the majority opinion of the assessors, ""he shall give his reasons, which shall be written down and be pronounced in open court, for differing with such majority opinion, and in every such case the judge's summing up and the decision of the court together with, where appropriate, the judge's reasons for differing with the majority opinion of the assessors, shall collectively be deemed to be the judgment of the court"". Although the Criminal Procedure Code has since been repealed, section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Decree of 2009, which replaced the above quoted provision of the Code, follows the same principle and provides that the trial judge ""shall not be bound to conform to the opinions of the assessors"" and goes on to re-enact that the trial judge shall give his reasons for differing from the opinion of the assessors.”
 
 (14) In view of the above observation, this court needs to examine the summing up and the judgment as a whole in order to determine whether the learned judge has misdirected the assessors and himself by shifting the burden of proof on the appellant.
 
 (15) In paragraph two of the summing up, the learned judge has directed the assessors that they have to decide what happened in this case and which version of the evidence is reliable. 
 
 (16) The learned judge in paragraphs four and thirty of the summing up has specifically explained that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution and it never shifts to the accused, as he is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. 
 
 (17) In spite of his direction given in paragraphs four and thirty, the learned judge has directed the assessors in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six of the summing up, that the decision of accepting which of the conflicting version of events given by the prosecution and the defence mainly depends on their assessment of credibility between the appellant and the complainant. Who is more credible between the appellant and the complainant? The learned judge in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six has stated that: 
  
• (22) The state’s case against the accused stands or falls on whether or not you accept the complainant or the accused’s version of events on the second and third element of rape, as discussed in paragraphs 9 (i) and 9 (ii) hereof. If you accept the complainant’s version of events, then you must find the accused is guilty as charged. if you accept the accused’s version of events, then you must find him not guilty as charged. I will not bore you with the details, but I will summaries to you the parties’ competing versions of events. 
 
 
• (26) So, you will see that the complainant’s and accused’s version of events on the alleged rape incident are completely at odds with each other. Your decision, on which version of events to accept and/or reject, will depend largely on your assessment on which of the two witnesses is the credible one. In other words, the state’s case against the accused stands or falls, on whether or not, you find the complainant or the accused to be a credible witness. You have watched them give evidence in the court room. Who was the more credible of the two? Who was the more forthright of the two? Who was the evasive witness of the two? Who was hiding something from you? Who, from your point of view, was telling the truth? Your answers to the above questions will determine your answers to whether or not the accused is guilty as charged. If you find the complainant to be a credible witness, then you will find the accused guilty as charged. If you find the accused a credible witness, then you will find him not guilty as charged. It is entirely a matter for you”
 

 (18) In view of the above two paragraphs, the learned judge has given the direction to the assessors to evaluate the evidence given by the appellant and the complainant, in order to determine who is more credible and telling the truth. If they found that the evidence given by the complainant is credible and truthful, they can find the appellant is guilty. Likewise, if they found the evidence given by the appellant is credible and truthful, the assessors can determine the appellant is not guilty. 
 
 (19) In paragraph thirteen of the Judgment, the learned judge has found the complainant as a more credible witness than the appellant. Accordingly, the learned judge has accepted the evidence given by the complainant. In paragraph thirteen, the learned judge states that:
 

 “As a result of the above, I found the complainant a more credible witness than the accused, leading me to accept her as a credible witness. I accept her evidence that she did not consent to sex with the accused, at the material time, and that the accused knew, she was not consenting to sex, at the material time. If the complainant consented to sex at the material time, why the need to throw her on the floor, resulting in abrasions to the back of her left shoulder.”
 
 
 (20) Accordingly, the learned judge has accepted the evidence given by the complainant on the ground that she is a more credible witness than the appellant. By doing that, the learned judge has placed a burden on the appellant to satisfy the court that the evidence given by him in the hearing is more credible than of the complainant’s in order to defeat the case of the prosecution, which he failed to satisfy. 
 
 (21) In the minority decision of Brennan J in Liberato and Others v The Queen ((1985) [1985] HCA 66; 159 CLR 507 at 515) has succinctly discussed the appropriate approach for directing the jury in a case, where there is conflicting versions of evidence given by the prosecution witnesses and the evidence given by the defence witnesses. Brennan J held that:
 

 “When a case turns on a conflict between the evidence of a prosecution witness and the evidence of a defence witness, it is commonplace for a judge to invite a jury to consider the question; who is to be believed? But it is essential to ensure, by suitable direction, that the answer to that question ( which the jury would doubtless ask themselves in any event) if adverse to the defence, is not taken as concluding the issue whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issue which it bears the onus of proving. The jury must be told that; even if they prefer the evidence for the prosecution, they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. The jury must be told that, even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue. His Honour did not make clear to the jury, and the omission was hardly remedied by acknowledging that the question whom to believe is “a gross simplification.”
 
 
 (22) Dunford J in R v Li (2003) 140 A Crim R 288, at 301, adopting the principle enunciated by Brennan J in the minority decision in Liberato (supra) held that:
 

 ""Not only was it there in his last passage a reference to “a doubt based on reason” but in two instances, the judge has proposed to the jury the question which of the two cases is correct, what the complainant says or what the appellant says. This was also a material misdirection. The issue can never be which of the cases is correct or who of the complainant and the accused is telling the truth; Liberato v The Queen [1985] HCA 66; (1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515. They should have been directed the test was whether taking into account the whole of the evidence, including what had been said by the appellant in his recorded interview, and the witnesses called in his case, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant’s evidence.” 
 
 
 (23) Basnayake JA in Goundar v State [2015] FJCA 1; AAU0077.2011 (2 January 2015), while accepting the principle as expounded in Liberato (supra) and R v Li (supra) held that:
 

 “The learned judge directed the Assessors to find the appellant guilty or not guilty by considering whose evidence they believe. By so doing the Assessors have been misdirected with regard to the burden of proof, and thereby caused a miscarriage of justice. The Assessors may believe the evidence of Emma and disbelieve the evidence of the appellant. It does not mean that the case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If, after considering the evidence of the whole case, a reasonable doubt is created in the minds of the Assessors with regard to the guilt of the appellant, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and entitled to an acquittal. The courts have held in a series of cases that it is not correct to find the guilt of the accused by allowing the Assessors to believe either party” (empasis added)
 
 
 (24) The appellant is not obliged to give evidence. He does not have to prove his innocence as his innocence is presumed by law. However, in this case, the appellant has decided to give evidence. Therefore, such evidence given by the appellant has to be taken into consideration, when determining the issues of facts of this case. 
 
 (25) Lord Reading CJ in Abramovitch (1914) 84 L.J.K.B 397) held that:
 

 ""If an explanation has been given by the accused, then it is for the jury to say whether on the whole of the evidence they are satisfied that the accused is guilty. If the jury think that the explanation given may reasonably be true, although they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitle to be acquitted, inasmuch as the crown would then have failed to discharge the burden impose upon it by our law of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The onus of proof is never shifted in these cases; it always remains on the prosecution.”
 
 
 (26) Accordingly, the learned judge is required to direct the assessors that if they believe the evidence given by the appellant is true, then the appellant must be acquitted. If the assessors neither believe nor disbelieve the version of the appellant, yet, it creates a reasonable doubt in their mind about the prosecution’s case, they must find the appellant is not guilty. 
 
 (27) Even if the assessors and/or the judge reject the version of the appellant, that does not mean that the prosecution has established that the appellant is guilty for the offence. Still they have to satisfy that the prosecution has established, on its own evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant has committed this offence as charged in the information. 
 
 (28) According to the above discussed reasons, it is clear that the directions given by the learned judge in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six of the summing up are actually founded on misguided principles on the burden of proof in a criminal proceedings. However, I am mindful about the directions given by the learned judge in paragraphs four and thirty of the summing up, where his Lordship has specifically stated that the burden of proof that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution and it will never shift to the accused at any stage of the trial. Irrespective of the above directions given in paragraphs four and thirty, the directions given in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six in order to evaluate the evidence given by the complainant against the evidence of the appellant, has created a confusion, thus making a material misdirection on the burden of proof. 
 
 (29) In spite of the above misdirection on the burden of prove, the assessors in their majority opinion found the appellant is not guilty for the offence as charged. The learned judge in his judgment, dissenting with the majority opinions of the assessors, found the appellant guilty for the offence and convicted him accordingly. The learned judge is the final adjudicator of facts and law of the matter. The assessors only provide him their opinion, which he could take into consideration in his judgment. (vide Noa Maya v State 2015, FJSC 30; CAV009.2015 (23 October 2015). Hence, I now proceed to determine whether the learned judge in his judgment has misdirected himself on the issue of burden of prove. 
 
 (30) In paragraph twelve of his Judgment, the learned judge has found the appellant is not a credible witness on the grounds of his evasiveness and the demeanour in giving evidence during the cross examination by the learned counsel for the prosecution. The learned judge then in paragraph thirteen found the complainant as a more credible witness than the appellant and accepted the evidence given by the complainant. 
 
 (31) It is clear that the learned judge has found the appellant guilty by considering whose evidence is more credible. By doing that, the learned judge has misdirected himself with regard to the burden of proof, causing a miscarriage of justice. 
 

Grounds Two and Three
 
 
 (32) The second and third grounds of appeal are founded on the contention that the learned judge has not properly directed the assessors in the summing up about the evidence given by the second witness for the prosecution, specially regarding the events that have taken place after she met and encountered the complainant and the appellant near the gun site. Moreover, the appellant contends that the learned judge has failed to properly direct the assessors in the summing up about the evidence given by the complainant during the cross examination, where she has stated that she told her aunty about this incident after she was beaten up by the aunty with a stick. Therefore, for the convenience, I proceed to deal with the second and third grounds of appeal together. 
 
 (33) The prosecution presented the evidence of five witnesses. They are the complainant, the aunty of the complainant, father of the complainant, the doctor who conducted the medical examination of the complainant and the police officer who conducted the caution interview of the appellant. The medical report of the complainant and the caution interview of the appellant were tendered as the exhibits of the prosecution. The defence presented the evidence of the appellant and one Rusiate who is the son of the second witness of the prosecution and cousin of the complainant.
 
 (34) The complainant in her evidence explained about this incident. She has gone to the gun site to return the key to the appellant. He was in the ‘bure’. He has offered to take her around the gun site. The appellant has then pulled her inside a cave. He has then pushed her down, injuring her left shoulder. The appellant has not said anything. She was scared and ashamed. He has pulled her wrap-around ‘sulu’. The appellant then undressed himself and put his penis into her vagina. The appellant has had sexual intercourse with her for about five minutes. When he finished, she has heard that her aunty was calling her from outside of the cave. She came out from the cave. Her aunty was angry and hit her, asking what happened. She cried and only after she was hit by her aunt with a stick, she told her aunty about this incident. 
 
 (35) The aunty of the complainant, in her evidence stated that the complainant looked shocked and guilty when she came out of the tunnel. She was crying and had scratches on her shoulder. When she asked what happened, the complainant did not answer initially. Hence, she had to beat the victim with a stick, then she told her about this incident. 
 
 (36) The doctor in his evidence specifically stated that, according to his opinion, a penetration had most likely occurred, but not beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, the doctor has stated in his evidence that he cannot be certain of what happened. If the examination was done a day after the incident, he would be certain of his medical conclusion. 
 
 (37) Detective Sergeant Mikaele Koro, who is the interviewing officer of the caution interview of the appellant, explained in his evidence the manner and the way he recorded the interview of the appellant. 
 
 (38) The main contention of the appellant is that the learned judge has not directed the assessors the following evidence, that were given by the first and second witnesses for the prosecution, inter alia; 
  
• The complainant was shocked and looked guilty when she came out of the tunnel,
 
• When the aunty asked her what happened, she did not answer initially, 
 
• The complainant told her aunty about this incident, only after she was beaten up by the aunty with a stick. 
 

 (39) Archibold 2017 Paragraph 4-438 pg. 555 states that:
 

 “Brevity in summing up is a virtue, not a vice; there is no obligation to rehearse all the evidence or all the arguments; generally speaking, however, the longer a trial has lasted, the greater will be the jury's need for assistance in relation to the evidence; in a trial lasting several days or more it will generally be of assistance if the judge summarizes those factual matters that are not in dispute and, where there is a significant dispute as to material facts, identifies succinctly those pieces of evidence that are in conflict; but the summing up should never be a mere rehearsal of the evidence and appeals based merely on the failure of the judge to refer to a particular piece of evidence or a particular argument will find little favor in the Court of Appeal; R v Farr, 163 J.P.193, CA. Nevertheless, a judge cannot abandon his responsibility to marshal and arrange the facts, issues by issue, to counsel and their speeches, or to the jury and their notes; R v Amado-Taylor (2000) 2 Cr. App. r. 189, CA” 
 
 
 (40) According to page ninety eight of the record of the proceedings in the High Court, it appears that the learned counsel for the appellant has raised these issues before the learned judge as re-directions. The record of the proceedings in the High Court states that the learned judge has accordingly re-directed the assessors. Therefore, it is clear that the learned judge has re-directed the assessors regarding the above discussed evidence. 

Determination of Appeals by the Court of Appeal Pursuant to Section 23 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act
 
 
 (41) Section 23 (1) (a) of the Court of Appeal Act stipulates that: 
 

 “On any such appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
 
 
 (42) The proviso of Section 23 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act states that:
 

 “Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal against conviction or against acquittal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.”
 
 
 (43) According to Section 23 (1) (a), it is clear that the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if the court thinks that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that there had been a wrong decision of any question of law or on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice. It is clear from the proviso to section 23 (1) the duty of the Court of Appeal is to satisfy itself that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice at the trial. 
 
 (44) Having considered Section 23 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act, I now proceed to evaluate the evidence adduced in the hearing, in order to determine whether the conviction entered by the learned judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the totality of the evidence adduced in the hearing or there has been a miscarriage of justice.
 
 (45) In this case, the main disputed issue is whether the complainant gave her consent to the appellant to have sexual intercourse, which took place in private, inside the gun site cave. On this issue, the consent depends on the evidence given by the complainant against the evidence given by the appellant. Under such circumstances, it is necessary for the assessors and the trial judge to scrutinize the evidence given by the complainant with great care. (vide R v Li ( supra), Goundar v State (supra)). 
 
 (46) While dissenting with the majority opinion of the assessors, the learned judge in paragraph eleven of his judgment has found that the healed abrasions that were found on the left shoulder of the complainant support the claim of the complainant that she did not consent to the appellant to have sexual intercourse with her. 
 
 (47) The complainant in her evidence said that her left shoulder got injured when the appellant pushed her down inside the cave. The appellant and the complainant had no disagreement regarding the position that they had this sexual intercourse. The appellant came on top of her while she was lying on the ground of the cave. There is no evidence adduced by the prosecution that the complainant was lying on a cloth or any other material. Accordingly, it is clear that the complainant had this alleged sexual intercourse with the appellant while she was lying on the open ground inside the cave. According to the evidence given by the complainant, the appellant had this sexual intercourse with her for about five minutes. 
 
 (48) The learned judge neither in the summing up directed the assessors nor in the judgment has directed himself about this evidence regarding the circumstances in which this alleged sexual intercourse took place. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to deny the possibility that such abrasions could have been sustained on the shoulder of the complainant, if she engaged in a consensual sexual intercourse with the appellant, in the same position on the ground of the tunnel. Hence, I find that the healed abrasions found on the left shoulder of the victim could neither support the version of the prosecution nor of the defence.
 
 (49) During the evidence-in-chief, the complainant had said that the appellant pulled her inside the cave. However, during the cross examination, she had stated that the appellant did not ask her to follow him. He went into the cave and she followed him. This inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant could undoubtedly create a reasonable doubt, whether the appellant pulled her inside the cave or she just followed him into the cave on her own volition, unless the complainant provides an explanation for this contradiction in her own evidence. The learned judge has neither directed the assessor in the summing up nor himself in the judgment regarding this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant. 
 
 (50) The complainant in her evidence has stated that she did not like what happened to her. According to her evidence, the appellant had not said anything to her nor she has said anything to the appellant during this alleged incident. However, changing her earlier position, the complainant has then said that she told the appellant that she did not want the appellant to do what he was going to do. Again she has said that neither she nor the appellant said anything. Consequent to this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant, there is a reasonable doubt whether she told the appellant that she did not like what he was doing or not. The learned judge has neither directed the assessor in the summing up nor himself in the judgment regarding this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant. 
 
 (51) Moreover, during the cross examination, the complainant has stated that she did not know that Rusiate was following her from behind, when she was going to the gun site. She has then said that she did not try to run and escape from the cave, as Rusiate was at the door. She has not sought assistance from him, as she suspected that he also wanted to have sex with her. According to the evidence given by the second witness for the prosecution, she had asked Rusiate about the complainant, when she was looking for the complainant around the area. Rusiate had then told her that the complainant is down there. The second witness for the prosecution has not specifically stated about the place or the location where she met Rusiate. Meanwhile, Rusiate, who was called to give evidence for the defence, has stated that he saw the complainant and the appellant walking into the cave. The appellant was walking in front of the complainant and she was following him. His version of events supports the evidence given by the complainant in cross examination, where she has stated that she just followed the appellant into the cave. Furthermore, Rusiate in his evidence has stated that he stayed in the office which is about five metres away from the tunnel after the appellant and the complainant walked into the cave. Rusiate has then heard that the second witness for the prosecution was calling the complainant. He has then run towards the tunnel. Would it create a reasonable doubt whether Rusiate was standing at the door of the cave, preventing the complainant from escaping and also waiting to have sex with her, if all of this evidence was properly taken into consideration? The learned judge has neither directed the assessors in the summing up nor himself in the judgment about this evidence. 
 
 (52) I now draw my attention to the admissions made by the appellant in his caution interview, which had been tendered in evidence as an exhibit by the prosecution. 
 
 (53) The learned judge in paragraph twenty nine of the summing up has directed the assessors as follows:
 

 “If you accept that PW5 was a credible witness, then you will accept that the accused gives his alleged confession voluntarily, and use the same against him. In other words, by accepting the accused’s alleged confession, it will have the effect of strengthening the complainant’s evidence and the complainant’s credibility as a witness, and thereby find the accused guilty as charged. If you find the accused’s explanation was credible, then you will reject his alleged confession. You will have to work on the other evidence to make a decision in this case. It is a matter entirely for you”. 
 
 
 (54) According to the above passage in the summing up, I find that the learned judge has directed the assessors to consider only the voluntariness in making this alleged confession by the appellant. The issue of the voluntariness in making the caution interview by the appellant, is a matter relevant to the admissibility of the caution interview in evidence, which is an issue for the learned judge to decide upon a voir dire inquiry. The truthfulness and probative value of the contents of the caution interview is a matter for the assessors and the trial judge to decide in the substantive hearing. 
 
 (55) The learned Judge in his judgment has not discussed about the truthfulness or the probative value of the contents of the caution interview made by the appellant. Furthermore, his Lordship has not stated in the judgment, that the evidence adduced in the hearing led him to change his earlier position, which he took in the voir dire ruling, regarding the voluntariness in making the caution interview. 
 
 (56) Hon Chief Justice Gates in Lulu v State [2017] FJSC 19; CAV0035.2016 (21 July 2017) found that the direction suggested by Justice Keith in Maya v State [2015] FJSC 30; CAV009.2015 (23 October 2015) has no relevancy, if the trial judge remains of the conclusion that he reached in voir dire that the confession was made voluntarily. Where his Lordship Chief Justice held that:
 

 “In his judgment after receiving the unanimous opinions of the assessors of guilt, the trial judge came to the same conclusion. The judge had not changed his mind during the trial on the voluntariness of the petitioner in giving the caution interview. The direction as suggested in Noa Maya (supra) Keith J at para 23 following Mushtaq [2005] UKHC 25 is therefore not so relevant”.
 
 
 (57) In this case, the learned judge has not changed his mind regarding his earlier conclusion on the issue of voluntariness in making the caution interview. Hence, the direction on voluntaries in the summing up has no relevance. 
 
 (58) Prematilaka JA in Volau v State [2017] FJCA 51; AAU0011.2013 (26 May 2017) has discussed the appropriate direction to the assessors in respect of the confession made in the caution interview in an elaborative manner, where his Lordship found that:
 

 “How a trial Judge should direct the assessors as to a confessional statement or a caution interview has been discussed in a number of cases over the years. In Chand  v  State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0015 of 2012: 27 May 2016 [2016 FJCA 61] the Court of Appeal discussed in great detail most of the issues pertaining to voluntariness, admissibility, weight or probative value and truthfulness of a confession or a caution interview and the nature of directions to the assessors. The Court in Chand  had considered inter alia the decisions in Khan v State Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No. CAV009 of 2013: 17 April 2014 [2014 FJSC 6], Burns v The Queen [1975] HCA 21;  [1975] 132 CLR 258, Kean v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU 95 of 2008:13 November 2013 [2013 FJCA 117], Kean v State Criminal Appeal No. CAV0015/2010: 12 August 2011 [2011 FJSC 11], Basto v R [1954] HCA 78; [1954] [1954] HCA 78; 91 CLR 628 at 640 and 641, Chan Wei Keung v The Queen  [1967] 2 WLR 552, Wendo v The Queen [1963] A.J.L.R. 77 (Aust.), Prasad v The Queen [1981] 1 A. E. R 319, R. v Murray [1951] 1 Q. B. 391, R. v Cleary [1963] 48 Cr. A. R. 116, R. v Priestly [1966] 50 Cr. A. R. 183, R. v Bass [1953] 1 Q.B. 680, R. v. Sutherland and Johnstone [1959] Crim. L. Rev. 440, R. v Parkinson [1964] Crim. L. Rev. 398, R.v Fudge [1964] 108 S. J. 900, R. v Ward, The Times 18/11/1964, Sparks v The Queen [1964] A. C. 964 and Regina v. Mushtaq (Appellant) [2005] UKHL 25.
 
 
 The following principles could be deduced from the said decisions. (i)The matter of admissibility of a confessional statement is a matter solely for the judge to decide upon a voir dire inquiry upon being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of its voluntariness. (ii) Failing in the matter of the voir dire, the defence is entitled to canvass again the question of voluntariness and to call evidence relating to that issue at the trial ('second bite at the cherry') but such evidence goes to the weight and value that the jury would attach to the confession (Chan Wei Keung, Prasad and Murray) inter alia on the premise that there might be cases in which the jury would conclude that a statement is involuntary according to the rule relating to inducement, but nonetheless it is manifestly true (Wendo)(iii) Once a confession is ruled as being voluntary by the trial Judge, whether the accused made it, it is true and sufficient for the conviction (i.e. the weight or probative value) are matters that should be left to the assessors to decide as questions of fact at the trial. In that assessment the jury should be directed to take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the making of the confession including allegations of force, if those allegations were thought to be true to decide whether they should place any weight or value on it or what weight or value they would place on it. It is the duty of the trial judge to make this plain to them”
 
 
 (59) The learned judge in his summing up has not directed the assessors to decide following issues; whether the appellant made this confession, the truthfulness, and what is the probative value of the contents of the confession.
 
 (60) In order to determine the truthfulness and the probative value of the contents of the caution interview, it is necessary to take into consideration all the evidence adduced in the hearing. 
 
 (61) According to the answers given by the appellant pertaining to questions fifteen and eighteen of the caution interview, the appellant has called the complainant to come with him inside the gun tunnel site. While they were inside the gun tunnel, he has pulled the complainant in to one corner. However, the complainant in her evidence-in-chief has stated that she was pulled inside the cave by the appellant. During the cross examination, contradicting her earlier version given in evidence-in-chief, the complainant has stated that the appellant went into the cave and she followed him. Thereafter the appellant pushed her down to the floor. Accordingly it is clear that there are inconsistencies between the evidence given by the complainant with the confession made by the appellant in the caution interview, creating a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness of the contents of the confession.
 
 (62) Having considered the reasons discussed above, it is my considered opinion that if all these issues discussed above, pertaining to the evidence given by the complainant, were taken into proper consideration, together with all other evidence adduced during the course of the hearing, the verdict would have been favorable to the appellant. I accordingly find that the conviction entered against the appellant cannot be supported, having regarded the totality of evidence adduced in the hearing. Hence, I am satisfied that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. I accordingly set aside the conviction and the sentence entered against the appellant for the offence of Rape.
 (63) In view of the above conclusion I find no reason to proceed and determine the grounds of appeal advanced by the respondent against the sentence. I accordingly dismiss the same.
 

Alternative Count of Defilement of young person between 13 and 16 years of age
 
 
 (64) Section 162 (1) (f) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act allows the court to convict an accused for a lessor or alternative offence, where it states that:
  
• Where a person is charged with an offence but the court is satisfied that the evidence adduced in the trial supports a conviction only for a lesser or alternative offence, the court may record a conviction made after due process for —
  
• any sexual offence where the charge has been for rape;
 

 
• The court may record convictions for certain offences in accordance with sub-section (1) notwithstanding that no charge has been laid for the lesser or alternative offence in accordance with the provisions of this Decree.
 

 (65) According to the evidence adduced during this hearing, the appellant and the complainant did not dispute about this alleged sexual intercourse. The complainant was thirteen years old at the time this sexual encounter took place. According to the evidence given by the appellant, he knew the complainant as she is related to him as a cousin. 
 
 (66) Section 215 of the Crimes Act states that:
  
• A person commits a summary offence if he or she unlawfully and carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any person being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of 16 years, 
 


 Penalty — Imprisonment for 10 years.
 
  
• It shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under sub-section (1) if it shall be made to appear to the court that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the person was of or above the age of 16 years.
 
 
• It is no defence to any charge under sub-section (1)(a) to prove that the person consented to the act.
 

 (67) In view of the evidence adduced in the hearing, I am satisfied that the appellant is guilty for the offence of defilement of young person between 13 and 16 years age. I accordingly find appellant guilty for the said offence of defilement of young person between 13 to 16 years age, contrary to Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act and convict for the same. 
 
 (68) Taking into account the age of the victim, the age of appellant, and the fact that the appellant had been in prison for nearly three years and ten months, I am of the view that justice will be served by imposing a sentence of three (3) years. I accordingly sentence the appellant to three (3) years imprisonment for the offence of defilement of young person between 13 to 16 years age, contrary to Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act, to be effective from 8th of November 2013. 
 

The Orders of the Court are: 
  
• The Appeal is allowed, 
 
• Conviction for the offence of Rape is quashed and sentence is set aside, 
 
• The Appellant is convicted for the offence of defilement of young person between 13 to 16 years age, contrary to Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act,
 
• The Appellant is sentenced to three (3) years imprisonment, with effect from 8th of November 2013.

246502,"JUDGMENT
  
• The appellant was convicted by the magistrate court upon pleading guilty to one count of assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009 (now Crimes Act). The Learned Magistrate sentenced the appellant for a term of 12 months imprisonment.
 
 
• The appellant assails the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate on the following grounds of appeal; 
• The learned magistrates sentencing is harsh and excessive in the circumstances of the case; and
 
• The petitioner was just a first offender and had a previous clean record in his whole life of 42 years and therefore a suspended sentence or a partially suspended sentence would have been appropriate in this circumstance.
 

 
• The summary of facts filed before the Learned Magistrate reads as follows; 
• On Friday 18.12.15 between 6pm to 6.30pm Anaiasa Naqialawa (B-1) 43 years, Painter at Cool Tech Refrigeration, Samabula, punched his wife namely Seruwaia Vuki (A-1) 32 years, domestic duties of Lomolomo, Vuda, Lautoka.
 
• On the above date and time (A-1) informed (B-1) that she will have to go back to Lautoka that afternoon as agreed.
 
• The agreement was for (A-1) to visit (B-1) on 12.12.15 and return to Lautoka on 18.12.15.
 
• Unfortunately (B-1) told (A-1) not to go back but (A-1) replied that she would like to spend Christmas with her mother.
 
• (B-1) then got angry, took a stick and hit (A-1) with it on her back. (B-1) after hitting (A-1) with a stick, took the electricity wire and also hit her back with it. (A-1) received injuries on her back, hand and left arm. (B-1) also punched (A-1) on her left ear and head.
 
• The matter was reported at Nadi Police station whereby (A-1) was sent to the hospital to be medically examined.
 
• (B-1) was arrested and interviewed under caution in which he admitted committing the offence. [Refer to Q & A No. 14-18].
 
• Later accused was charged for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
• Accused was bailed to appear in court on 03.02.16.
 

 
• In the case of Kim Nam Bae v The State [AAU0015 of 1998S (26 February 1999)] the court of appeal said thus;

“It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial Judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499).”
 
  
• Therefore, in order for this court to interfere with the impugned sentence, the appellant should satisfy that the Learned Magistrate; 
• acted upon a wrong principle;
 
• allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
• mistook the facts; or
 
• did not take into account some relevant consideration.
 


Ground one
  
• The Learned Magistrate has selected 12 months as the starting point of the sentence, added 12 months in view of the aggravating factors that were identified and deducted 6 months in view of the mitigating factors. Further 6 months was deducted as the discount for the early guilty plea to arrive at the final sentence of 12 months imprisonment.
 
 
• On the first ground of appeal, the appellant argues that the Learned Magistrate erred by selecting a high starting point and that led to a harsh and excessive sentence being imposed on the appellant given the circumstances of the case.
 
 
• In fact the appellant submits that the starting point selected by the Learned Magistrate is outside the higher end of the established tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm relying on the case of Jonetani Sereka v State [2008] FJHC 88; HAA027.2008 (25 April 2008).
 
 
• In Sereka (supra) referring to the case State v Anjula Devi [Criminal Case No. 04 of 1998 Lab.], the court noted that the tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm is ‘a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault’.
 
 
• The Learned Magistrate has identified ‘an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment’ as the applicable tariff in this case relying on the judgment in State v Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78. The court held in Tugalala (supra) as follows;
 

“The tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. The High Court said in Elizabeth Joseph v. The State [2004] HAA 030/04S and State v. TevitaAlafi [2004] HAA073/04S, that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence.”
 
  
• The starting point of 12 months selected by the Learned Magistrate is in fact the higher end of the tariff the Learned Magistrate decided to apply. According to paragraph 9 of the impugned decision, I note that the Learned Magistrate had considered the gravity of the offending and the appellant’s culpability when the starting point was selected. Therefore, it is clear that in selecting this starting point of 12 months imprisonment, the Learned Magistrate had overlooked the following principles discussed in the case of Koroivuki v State [AAU 0018 of 2010] which the Learned Magistrate had in fact alluded to in the impugned decision;
 

“In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff”.
 
  
• In order to arrive at a just and a proportionate sentence using the two-tier method of sentencing, the sentencer should not consider the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case at hand in selecting the starting point, but consider the question ‘what should be the minimum sentence the offence committed by the accused would attract’ as I have discussed in the case of Gaunavinaka v State [2017] FJHC 425; HAA 07 of 2017 (13 June 2017). A sentencer who considers the gravity of the actual offending and/or the culpability of the accused to select the starting point will in all probability arrive at an excessive final sentence for the reason that the same aggravating factors are taken into account twice in the sentencing process, unless the sentencer is extremely careful.
 
 
• In the event a sentencer opts to determine the starting point considering certain circumstances of the actual offending, those circumstances that were considered to select the starting point should be clearly indicated in the ruling. This will prevent appeal grounds being raised on the sentence being harsh and excessive due to double counting. But more importantly, such practice would also assist the sentencer to arrive at a just and an appropriate sentence using the two-tier approach of sentencing by reducing the chances of taking into account the same factors to select a high starting point and then again to further increase the sentence.
 
 
• In the case at hand, the language used in the impugned decision suggests that the same aggravating factors that were taken into account to enhance the sentence by 12 months have been considered by the Learned Magistrate to select the higher end of the tariff as the starting point of the sentence. I am inclined to agree with the appellant that this decision to select a manifestly high starting point had resulted in arriving at a sentence that is harsh and excessive given the circumstances of the case.
 
 
• However, I am unable to agree with the appellant’s submission that the starting point selected by the Learned Magistrate is outside the established tariff. This court in several previous decisions including Kumar v State [2014] FJHC 592; HAA18.2014 (14 August 2014), State v Naicker [2015] FJHC 537; HAC279.2013 (15 July 2015), State v Jone [2016] FJHC 517; HAC159.2015 (7 June 2016), and State v Salayavi [2017] FJHC 198; HAC203.2016 (17 March 2017) has recognised ‘an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment’ as the tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm.
 
 
• It is pertinent to note that 12 months is only a one fifth of a 5 year imprisonment which is the maximum sentence for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the Crimes Act. All in all, I am of the view that it is appropriate to have 12 months imprisonment as the higher end of the tariff for the said offence.
 
 
• Needless to say, the selecting of a starting point is not that difficult where the relevant sentencing tariff indicates the lower end of the imprisonment term applicable to a particular offence as opposed to other sentencing options that may be considered.
 
 
• If the sentencer decides that an imprisonment term is the appropriate punishment for an offender who is convicted of the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the Crimes Act and not to opt for an absolute or conditional discharge, it is important for the sentencer to have a clear opinion on the minimum imprisonment term the offence should attract considering its objective seriousness. In my view, an imprisonment term of 3 months would appropriately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the Crimes Act.
 
 
• Though the appellant has not raised any issue concerning the aggravating factors considered by the Learned Magistrate, I wish to make the following observations regarding same. The aggravating factors mentioned in the impugned decision are as follows;
  
• Abuse of trust and power;
 
• The victim did not provoke you at all;
 
• This is a domestic violence offence.
 

 
• The first factor above is indeed an aggravating factor.
 
 
• With regard to the second factor, firstly, I am not satisfied that the relevant summary of facts leads to the conclusion that there was no provocation in this case. Secondly and more importantly, in my view, though the fact that there was provocation may be considered as a mitigating factor, the fact that there was no provocation cannot be considered as an aggravating factor to enhance the sentence in a case of assault.
 
 
• On the face of it, the third aggravating factor alluded to above, that is the fact that the offence was a domestic violence offence seems to overlap with the first. In my view, the domestic relationship between the accused and the victim was the reason to conclude that there was an abuse of trust and power. Moreover, it is pertinent to note that section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act provides certain factors a sentencer must have regard to when sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence. Therefore, I am of the view that a sentence cannot be enhanced for the simple reason that the relevant offence falls under the category of domestic violence offences. However, certain factors listed under section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act among others may be considered as aggravating factors when it comes to a domestic violence offence.
 
 
• As highlighted in the case of Tugalala (supra), when it comes to the offence of assault casing actual bodily harm, it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence. If the injuries caused to the victim are serious, that is undoubtedly one of the main aggravating factors.
 
 
• The summary of facts filed in this case indicates that the victim was first assaulted with a stick, then with an electricity wire and thereafter she was punched on the left ear and the head. I note that the Learned Magistrate had taken this factor into account only when the issue of suspending the sentence was considered. The manner in which the victim was attacked in this case as revealed in the summary of facts was a factor the Learned Magistrate should have considered as an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence.
 
 
• I had the opportunity to peruse four judgments of this court where the offence involved assaulting the spouse. In all four cases, the offenders had pleaded guilty to the charge.
 
 
• In Raisoqoni v State [2011] FJHC 32; HAA 004.2011(7 February 2011) this court held that a sentence of 6 months was appropriate where the injuries sustained by the victim included lumps, bruises, laceration and swellings over her head and face.
 
 
• In State v Kumar [2011] FJHC 341; HAA 020.2010 (9 June 2011) a suspended sentence of 6 months imprisonment was considered as the appropriate sentence where the victim had sustained injuries that included a swollen face, bruises around both eyes, swollen lips, superficial cuts on the head and a broken tooth.
 
 
• In Chand v State [2011] FJHC 593; HAA 024.2011 (23 September 2011) a sentence of 4 months was held appropriate where the appellant had pushed and punched his wife causing her to fall and hit her head on the stud of the house.
 
 
• In Kumar v State [2014] FJHC 592; HAA18.2014 (14 August 2014) this court concluded that an imprisonment term of 7 months is the appropriate sentence where the appellant had slapped his wife and cut her on the left arm with a cane knife. This offence had been committed while another case was pending against the appellant for assaulting his wife.
 
 
• All in all, I find merit in the first ground of appeal. The error made by the Learned Magistrate as pointed out on behalf of the appellant on ground one justifies this court’s intervention to disturb the sentence imposed on the appellant.
 
 
• Having considered the relevant aggravating factors and the mitigating factors including the fact that the appellant was a first offender and the early guilty plea, I hold that a sentence of 6 months imprisonment is appropriate in this case.
 

Ground two
  
• On the second ground of appeal the appellant submits that a suspended sentence or a partially suspended sentence would have been appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
• Since I have decided to substitute the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate with an imprisonment term of 6 months based on the findings on the first ground of appeal, the determination of the above issue raised on the second ground of appeal would now become an academic exercise. The appellant had served almost 5 months in prison as of today which is more than two third of a term of 6 months imprisonment.

Conclusion
  
• In the result, I would substitute the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate in MC Suva, Crim. Case No. 104 of 2016 with an imprisonment term of 6 months. The order made by the Learned Magistrate granting a permanent domestic violence restraining order shall remain. Any application for variation, suspension or discharge of this restraining order is to be filed and heard in the Magistrate Court at Suva.

Orders of this court;
  
• The appeal against the sentence is allowed;
 
• The sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate on 31/01/2017 in Magistrate Court Suva Criminal Case No. 104 of 2016 is set aside; and
 
• The said sentence is substituted with an imprisonment term of 06 months.

81790,"SENTENCE

Prakash, J

The accused Prabha Wati has been found Guilty of the offence of Manslaughter. She went on trial for the offence of Murder. The 3 assessors' unanimous opinion was that she was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Court has concurred with their opinion. Whatever analysis one undertakes of the assessors opinion - whether not guilty to murder due to lack of malice aforethought or guilty of manslaughter due to provocation, it is clear that the issue of domestic violence was central to the verdict in this case. This is apparently the first case in Fiji in which the phenomenon of Battered Woman's Syndrome was raised as the central plank of the Defense case. 

In mitigation learned Defense Counsel urged the Court to give a chance to the accused to have some life for the rest of her days. As he stated she did not have much of a life during her marriage due to the history of domestic violence. It is evident that the accused began living with her deceased husband when she was about 16 years old. Her parents subsequently married her to him when she came of age. According to the evidence her problems began when her first child was born. Her husband was apparently unhappy that she had given birth to a girl. The situation compounded when she gave birth to 3 other daughters. Her husband's heavy drinking and womanising did not help matters. She was subjected to sexual, mental and physical abuse for much of her 35 or so years of marriage. It is clear from the evidence that she suffered from Battered Woman's Syndrome. Whatever conceptualisation one has of this phenomenon or theory it is essentially about the consequence of domestic violence on the mental state, emotional and physical well being of the battered spouse. 

The accused arrived at the Courtroom door through circumstances she appeared to have minimum control, and after long years of suffering and brutalisation to face the most serious criminal charge in our Penal Code. The genesis of this crime has to be seen in the abuse meted out to her by her most intimate partner. It is a sad reflection of our male oriented society that domestic violence is not seen as the terror it is in many homes in Fiji. We in Fiji, together with the rest of the world, are currently focused on another kind of terror. This deals with guns, bombs, hijacking and high finance. But the terror inflicted on the lives of the many women and children by excessive use of alcohol, by fists and boots, and weapons readily available around the house are as much insidious as that which gets prime time on TV. Domestic violence is terror in our backyards. Imagine the effects on our young and the most vulnerable members of society. 

It is true the dead cannot defend themselves. The living have to deal with the consequences of what their loved ones do. The poignance of this case is reflected in the daughter Dodo who gave evidence and is now burdened with putting her and her mother's life back to some semblance of normalcy. She had to come to Court to witness her mother stand trial, recount the intimate details of her parents' relationship and pick up the pieces from here. She was the one who tried to reconcile her parents after almost a year of separation. She witnessed the death which, maybe, she could have avoided. If only she knew what her mother was suffering from. 

It is also telling that the deceased was seen as a good man, who liked his drink, shared jokes (dirty and otherwise) with his male friends. Those who visited his house to drink grog or alcohol saw his family life as normal However, at is now becoming evident from studies by the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre, academics and other civil society organisations that spousal abuse is a major social problem in Fiji. It also has economic consequences. Due to the importance and sanctity of the family in the socio-cultural milieu in Fiji there is still considerable under reporting of spousal abuse. People do not want to intervene in the domestic lives of others. This concern for privacy and stigma attached to spousal abuse means that a considerable number of our women and children are deprived of support. Men themselves remain without counselling and the vicious cycle continues.

The range of sentencing options for manslaughter in Fiji have varied depending on the infinite variety of circumstances. Learned Defense counsel has asked for a suspended sentence. Learned State counsel has submitted that this case merits the upper scale of the sentencing for manslaughter. He did not specify what factors merited such an exercise of discretion by the Court. 

It is rare for the Courts in Fiji to deal with women who commit homicide against their husbands. According to a USP study, between 1982 to 1992 there were 25 episodes of husbands killing wives In the same period there were only 4 cases where the wife killed her husband (Adinkrah M (1996) Violent Encounters a study of Homicide Patterns in Society) Since 1992 there as no readily available data However, it is evident that it remains rare. In the above study only one case has similarities to the present case. In the case of State v Alumita Lewatsevu (Cr Case 1 of 1990L) the accused wife was also the victim of domestic violence. On the day of the killing the deceased husband came home drunk. He had an argument with his wife. He then beat his wife for roughly 3 hours stopping only after he was exhausted. He then got cane knife and threatened to kill the accused when he woke up. He left the cane knife beside his bed. The accused who had fled the house returned after about 30 minutes and saw her husband still in drunken slumber. The Court accepted that ""she could no longer stand his ill treatment of her and she lost control"" She grabbed the knife and chopped her husband's neck three times. She was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment suspended for 3 years.

In the latest case available and quoted by Defense counsel the accused was also sentenced to 2 years, suspended for 3 years. (State v Koleta Rote HAC 005 of 2001S.) In this case the accused wife was armed with a knife. 

This Court had reviewed the authorities and applicable principles of sentencing manslaughter cases in its sentencing in State v Ramendra Chandra (Cr Case HAC 0008 of 1999L) and State v Samuela Nemila & Josaia Nacika (Cr Case HAC 0011 of 1998L). In the case of Samuela Nemila & Josaia Nacika the Court had also considered the case of Kim Nam Bae v State (FCA Cr. App AAU (0015 of 1998). This was the only case referred to by learned State counsel in seeking a sentence on the upper scale for manslaughter. It is quite clear that the case Kim Nam Bae, apart from being a spousal killing, has almost no relevance to the present case. In that case it was the accused husband who killed his wife arising out of a domestic dispute, and where the degree of provocation by the deceased wife was minimal. 

In this case there was extreme provocation. No weapons were used. The wife apparently snapped due to years of domestic violence and the consequent effect of Battered Woman's Syndrome. There was minimal time for premeditation. After the event she was in ""deep shock"" and ""tatters"", as Prosecution witnesses described her. She cooperated with the Police and fire authorities. At the time of the offence she was diagnosed as suffering from Acute Stress Reaction, according to the Consultant Psychiatrist. She had been exposed to an exceptional mental and physical stress. This situation was particularly stressful because she was physically sick and disabled with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and right sided weakness as a result of stroke. She was further provoked into an uncontrollable emotional reaction, according to the psychiatrist. 

The Court has considered all the relevant authorities available to it on sentencing for manslaughter by the High Court. It has also considered the sentence appeals from the High Court by the Court of Appeal. As the Court of Appeal has stated: ""The cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and the provocation is minimal (Kim Nam Bae (supra) p.4). The case of State v Shakuntla Devi (Cr Case HAC001 of 2001S) is also relevant. In this case the accused killed her elder sister who had provoked her. The accused was given a suspended sentence. 

The Court takes note of the age of the accused, her clean record until this offence, and her medical condition. The Court also takes into consideration the fact that she was in remand from 1/1/99 to 06107/01, a period of about 2½ years. This period of detention would amount to a sentence of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months (before remission). 

In view of all that has been said above the Court sentences the Accused to 2 years imprisonment, suspended for 2 years. (The effect of the suspended sentence is explained to the accused.) 

Suspended 2 year sentence imposed.

79123,"JUDGMENT

1. On the 8th of February 2012, in the Magistrates Court at Savusavu the appellant entered a plea of guilty to one count of indecent assault, contrary to Section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. He was sentenced on the same day to a term of imprisonment of three years, with a minimum to be served of two years and six months.

2. The appellant appeals that sentence on the basis that it is harsh and excessive and that the Magistrate did not take his family circumstances into account and consider alternative sentencing options.
3. The facts agreed were that the victim of the assault was his 15 year old niece who at the time was staying at his home looking after his children. The appellant went into a room where the victim was ironing his working clothes and he touched her on her breasts and also on her vagina. The victim complained immediately to her parents and the matter was reported.

4. The maximum penalty for indecent assault is five years and the range of sentences is between one year to four years (Penioni Rakoto HAA 68/02). The upper band of this range should be for assaults which are in breach of trust and/or on children.

5. The appellant is 35 years old and married with 6 children. He works as a barman earning $150 per week. He expressed remorse below and before this Court. In a written submission he provides details of similar cases where the sentence has been considerably less.

6. The Magistrate in sentencing the appellant and taking into account the gravity of the offence, the victim being a child, took a starting point of four years imprisonment. He added one year for aggravating features and deducted one year for mitigating features. He deducted one year for the plea of guilty arriving at the final sentence of three year's imprisonment.

7. The Magistrate quite properly took a high starting point of four years considering the circumstances of the indecent assault. He fell into error however by then adding a year for the same aggravating features which led him to take a high starting point. He has punished the appellant twice for those features which is not fair. It is proper to reduce the starting point to reflect the appellant's clear record and his remorse and a meaningful deduction for the plea of guilty is also in order.

8. The appellant's family circumstances are not relevant to mitigation of his sentence. He should have thought of his family, and in particular of his two daughters, when committing the offence.

9. It is never helpful to look at sentences for similar offending. Each case turns on its own facts and a lesser sentence in another case does not disclose the mitigation available in that case.

10. To recast the sentence pursuant to Section 256(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree, this Court would take the same starting point of four years to reflect the seriousness of assaulting a child in breach of trust. Nothing should then be added to that starting point for aggravating features. To reflect his clean record and his remorse a deduction of one year should be given and then finally for his plea of guilty a further one year is to be deducted. The final sentence should be one of two years' imprisonment.

11. The appeal succeeds to the extent that the sentence is reduced to one of two years, with a minimum term to be served of eighteen months.

79923,"SENTENCE

1. Mahendra Kumar, you have been found guilty, after a 4 days trial, of raping Nitasha Singh, at Labasa in the Northern Division, contrary to section 207(1) and section 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree 2009. Three assessors unanimously found you guilty as charged, and the Court concurred with them. As a result, you were convicted as charged.

2. The facts of your case were quite disturbing. In September 2010, Nitasha was doing Form 7 studies at Labasa College. She resided at Kawakawavesi, Seaqaqa, with her parents. At the time, Nitasha was a sickly girl, and she regularly suffered from severe headaches. Her parents sought divine intervention, through a ""pundit"" or priest, to pray over her and heal her.

3. You fraudulently held yourself out to be a ""pundit"" or priest, to Nitasha's family. They brought you to their home to pray for and heal Nitasha. She was 18 years old at the time, and you were 29 years old. You saw an opportunity to exploit this family, by enticing Nitasha to your home in Tabia, in the midst of canefields, and far away from everyone. You intended to make Nitasha your wife, and you intended to force yourself on her sexually.

4. Unbeknown to Nitasha's unsuspecting parents, you with the aid of your mother, took Nitasha to your home in Tabia. Nitasha wrongly believed that you were a genuine ""pundit"" and priest, and you were going to pray for her and heal her. As a result, she willingly came to your home on 23rd September 2010. She didn't know, she was walking into your trap.

5. Once in the comfort of your home, and knowing that Nitasha was far away from her family, you revealed your true self to her. You said, you were no ""pundit"" or priest. You then put into action your real intention of having unlawful sexual intercourse with her. You asked her for sex, but she refused. You then raped her on 24th September 2010. You then repeatedly raped her on 25th, 26th, and 27th September 2010. You continued to rape her until 11th October 2010, when her parents came and took her to the police station.

6. Rape is a serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The tariff for rape is a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal. The actual sentence passed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors. 

7. The mitigating factors in your case were as follows:

(i) At the age of 29 years, this is your 1st offence;
(ii) You are the sole breadwinner in your family, looking after your sickly parents, and a brother and sister.

8. The aggravating factors in your case were as follows:

(i) Your intrusion into Nitasha's family was extremely devious and calculating. You unashamingly used religion as the perfect cover to invade and disrupt the peace and harmony of this unsuspecting family. Nitasha was a sickly 18 year old girl, at the time, and badly needed help to cure her sickness. It is not unusual in Fiji for families to seek divine intervention, to cure their sick. You well knew this, and you fraudulently pretended to be a ""pundit"" or priest, to win the confidence of this family. You succeeded in fraudulently winning Nitasha's family's confidence, and you cunningly put your evil intentions into action. At the age of 29 years old, you secretly planned to make Nitasha your wife, with or without her consent. You secretly planned to force yourself onto her sexually. You deviously used your mother to persuade Nitasha and her family for you to take her to your home, to be prayed over and healed. You well knew your home was in the midst of canefields, and far away from everyone – a perfect environment in which to subdue Nitasha's will to resist. You then set about to take away her virginity. Despite her continued protest, you raped her on 24th September 2010. Then you repeatedly raped her from then until 11th October 2010. You showed utter disregard for Nitasha's rights as a human being, and in fact, you treated her as a sex slave. For these misdeeds, you must pay with the loss of your freedom.

9. I start with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the
7 years by 1 year, leaving a balance of 6 years. For the aggravating factors, I increase the 
6 years by 7 years, leaving a total sentence of 13 years. I sentence you, Mahendra
Kumar to 13 years imprisonment. Your sentence is a warning to others, who wish to
follow your footsteps.

10. In summary, Mahendra Kumar, you are sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, and pursuant to section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, you are to serve a non-parole period of 9 years.

249149,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] On the 7th August, 2015, the Accused was found guilty after trial and was convicted by this Court of one representative count of penile Rape of a 17 year girl. The Accused now comes before this Court for sentence on conviction.
 
 
[2] The facts of the case were that:
 
 
The victim of this case was 17 years of age at the time of the incident. After a dispute with her mother she decides to leave home. Having contacted a friend, she leaves for Tavua on the 20th of October. She could not find Meli in Tavua. She meets Seruwaia who was known to her. In search of Meli she goes to a church in Yasiyasi with Seruwaia but never meets Meli. Seruwaia introduces the victim to the Accused and they get acquainted with each other. 
 
 
She goes to Seruwaia's friend, Alumita's place. Accused comes there in night and attempts to talk to her. She smells liquor on him and is reluctant to talk. Accused forcibly gets hold of her, grabs her hands and takes her to a nearby house. In the kitchen of the house, Accused puts her down, undresses her and inserts his penis into her vagina. He does it twice without her consent. He leaves her thereafter. Police comes and takes her to a hospital where she is medically examined in a distressed condition. Doctor finds fresh lacerations on upper vaginal wall, multiple bruises around the neck, extra ordinarily pulling of large amount of blood in vagina.
 
 
[3] The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment. It is now well settled, and confirmed by the Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj CAV003.2014 that the tariff for rape of a juvenile is 10-15 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[4] The accused at the time of the rape was 18 years, an adult in law and the victim was only 17, a juvenile. 
 
 
Mitigating Factors 
 
 
[5] In a comprehensive written submission, Counsel for the Accused submits that the Accused is married and he is a father of three year old son. He is presently working as a security officer and supports his siblings and his parents on his salary. He was in New Zealand on a rugby scholarship and has returned to Fiji upon completion of the scholarship. He has plans to migrate to New Zealand to provide his family a better future. 
 
 
[6] In the sentencing hearing, Deacon of the Methodist Church at Tavua, Mr. Ratuovini Bokini was called by the Accused to substantiate facts his Counsel had submitted already to this Court. The Deacon said that the Accused was closely associated with the church and looking after not only his family but the extended family and neighbours as well. He further said he had noticed a change in Accused's way of life for better after his marriage and becoming a father. 
 
 
[7] According to the Accused's marriage certificate and his child's birth certificate tendered to Court, Accused has committed this offence after his marriage and when his child was only three months old. He has engaged himself in an extra marital sexual conduct for which he is now convicted as a husband and a father, against the teachings of the church. I am unable to agree with the Deacon. 
 
 
[8] Three year old son will now be looked after by his domestic worker wife. Long prison sentence of his father will undoubtedly be detrimental to child's upbringing.
 
 
[9] The Accused is the first offender and has a clear record hitherto and is young. He has co-operated during Police investigations.
 
 
Aggravating Factors 
 
 
[10] The Accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge and maintained that position right throughout the trial. By doing so, he has not saved the young girl from giving evidence and reliving the ordeal. He has thereby not shown remorse and repentance.
 
 
[11] The Accused knew of victim's vulnerability as a running away girl from home and also her vulnerability as a stranger in Tavua. Victim was a juvenile at the time of the rape. He exploited her vulnerability to satisfy his lustful desires even though he was a married man with a baby at the time of the incident. 
 
 
[12] In view of Accused's personal circumstances and his prospects of bright future as a young rugger player and also his three year old son's wellbeing, I considered, before proceeding to sentence, the following authorities cited by the Defence Counsel in mitigation. 
 
 
[13] In Moses Nariva v the State (2006) FJHC;HAA 0148J 2005, the accused was a young offender of 17 years old, juvenile. He was a first offender who pleaded guilty without wasting time of court and was remorseful. Madam Justice Shameem stated; 
 
 
""the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment''
 
 
 [14] In State v Nayate Vatu (2015) FJHC 263; HAC 231.2011 (23 April 2015) Justice Madigan sentenced a 21 year old for seven years of imprisonment for two counts of juvenile rape with non-parole period of five years. In rationalizing his finding Justice Madigan stated;
 
 
"".....It appears to be extremely important in this case that a balance be struck between expectations of the community that such activity be punished and retribution be afforded the victim with the need to recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood. Whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him (her) when faced with a serious crime or crimes, a Court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to follow the same course of action....""
 
 
[15] In his concluding remarks Justice Madigan said; 
 
 
""... I am aware that this final sentence of seven years is below the tariff for rape of a child and it is in no way meant to distort the tariff already recognized by the Supreme Court. It is a lenient sentence in recognition of the youth of the accused and his remorseful plea of guilty saving the child from giving evidence.
 
 
[16] In State v Seniqai (2011) FJHC 375; HAC 010.2011 (8th July 2011) Justice Gounder sentenced a 18 year old rape accused for 5 years of imprisonment, below tariff. Justice Gounder imposing imprisonment without fixing a non- parole said;
 
 
""...You are 18 years old. Unfortunately, you are unemployed without any meaningful purpose in life. You left school after completing Form 4. The International Convention on the Rights of a Child applies to you because of your age. I bear in mind that a prison sentence should be the last resort for a child.
 
 
 ....I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment. The purpose of your sentence is to denounce your offence and to deter you and others from committing this type of offence. Due to your youth I do not fix a non-parole period...""
 
 
[17] There have been instances where Judges of the High Court have deviated from existing tariff when they find that the sentencing within tariff either disproportionately excessive or unjust in all the circumstances of the case. 
 
 
[18] There is no victim impact assessment report before me filed by the State. Victim is now married.
 
 
Sentence
 
 
[19] Having considered all the aspects, now I proceed to sentence the Accused as follows;
 
 
[20] To reflect the gravity of offending, not the offender, I take a starting point of 10 years at the bottom of the tariff for this offence. To reflect the aggravating features of lack of remorse and exploitation of vulnerability of a young juvenile, I add three years to that starting point. In recognition of his strong mitigation of clean record, time he spent in remand, his personal circumstances and his duty to family, I deduct those three years bringing the interim sentence back to ten years. For his youth and his prospects as a rugger player trained in New Zealand on a Scholarship I deduct a further two years, bringing his sentence down to one of eight years. 
 
 
[21] Having considered the Accused's future prospects and desire for rehabilitation, I order that he serve only five years before he is eligible for parole. 
 
 
[22] I concur with the reasoning given by Justice Madigan in State v Nayate Vatu in my selecting a sentence under Tariff. I also considered the age of the victim in sentencing the Accused under tariff. 
 
 
Summary
 
 
Accused is convicted for eight years imprisonment. He will serve a minimum of five (5) years before being eligible for parole.

76869,"SENTENCE

1. You, Jagdish Padiyachi are to be sentenced upon pleading guilty to the charge of act with intent to cause grievous harm contrary to section 224 of the Penal Code.

2. The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life.

3. You admitted the summary of facts and were convicted accordingly. As per the summary of facts the Complainant is your father. On the 22nd September 2008 you had an argument with your elder brother in regards to the paying for the house labourers. The argument heated up and you tried to fight with the elder brother. The Complainant intervened and he pushed you away. Then you got hold of a glass dish and hit on the nose of the Complainant. The complainant received injuries and the matter was reported to the Police.

4. According to the medical report the Complainant had received a laceration on his nasal bridge and the doctor had commented that “the patient may have permanently deformed Nasal Bridge”. The Complainant had been treated in the hospital for two days.

5. In State v. Mokubula [2003]FJHC 164 Justice Shameem stated that;

“On the basis of these authorities, the tariff for sentences under section 224 of the Penal Code, is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. In a case of an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years, depending on the nature of the weapon. 

Aggravating factors would be:

1. Seriousness of the injuries;
2. Evidence of premeditation or planning;
3. Length and nature of the attack;
4. Special vulnerability of the victim;
Mitigating factors would be:
1. Previous good character;
2. Guilty plea;
3. Provocation by the victim;
4. Apology, reparation or compensation.”

6. In this case you attacked 67 year old your own father who was trying to settle the dispute between you and your elder brother. I consider that as an aggravating feature.

7. In mitigation you said that you are 42 years, single and a priest. You said that you seek forgiveness. You promised that you will not re offend. You further informed Court that you have reconciled with the Complainant and now live in the same house. 

8. Although you claimed to be a priest your conduct does not seem to fall in line with the conduct of a priest. In any event, the Complainant was present in Court and he confirmed reconciliation. However it should be noted that this is not an offence which can be reconciled. Besides you waited for five years until the date of the trial to inform that you have reconciled with your father. I do not see any remorse on your part. Furthermore domestic violence acts of this nature have been repeatedly denounced by Courts. In State V David Batiratu HAR 01/2012 Chief Justice Gates stated;

“There may have been association here with reconciliation. Reconciliation is maintained in the Criminal Procedure Decree [section 154]; it was originally provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code at section 163. The promotion of reconciliation applies only to charges for offences of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, criminal trespass or damaging property. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree provides a much more detailed section than its predecessor, taking into account appropriate forms of apology, respect for the victim, mandatory counselling, rehabilitation, promises and undertakings to alter habits or conduct, such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs. Most especially the court must be satisfied that reconciliation is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner. This approach gives proper protection to children, women, or vulnerable persons. It also indicates the need for awareness of improper pressures which might be exerted to force through reconciliation. I respectfully suggest the old cases, approving discounts in sentence for cases where the complainant wished to withdraw are no longer the correct approach’: See Rt Peni Baleidraiba Kevetibau v State (1992) 38 FLR 110.”

9. You have 4 previous convictions. However I disregard two of them as they are more than ten years ago. The incident happened in September 2008 and you pleaded guilty only when the case was taken up for trial on the 17th April 2012. I cannot consider your plea as a timely plea of guilt. 

10. In this case I pick my starting point as 2 years. For the aggravating feature I enhance the sentence by 6 months. For the mitigatory factors I reduce the sentence by 12 months. Accordingly I impose 18 months imprisonment on you.

11. In State v. Mokubula [2003]FJHC 164 Justice Shameem further stated that;

“As a matter of principle, a suspended sentence is not appropriate for a case of act with intent to cause grievous harm not only because it is contrary to the accepted tariff, but also because section 29(3)(a) of the Penal Code contains a legislative fetter to the section 29 powers to impose a suspended sentence for crimes of violence"".

12. However as at now sentencing of persons is regulated by the Sentencing and penalties Decree No 42 of 2009. Although the offence in this case is committed prior to the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, as per the transitional provisions set out in section 61 of the Sentencing and penalties Decree I decide that section 29(3) of the Penal Code has no relevancy anymore.

13. Yet I do not think that the circumstances of this case and the guidelines set out by previous Court decisions warrant a non custodial sentence to be imposed on you. The Courts have time and again shown disinclination to impose non custodial sentences for grievous harm charges.

14. In the circumstances I impose 18 months imprisonment on you.

28 days to appeal.

	1.	On 15th March, 2013, the prosecution read the Summary of Facts in court. It was as follows. The accused, on 28th January, 2012, was 41 years, not married but with two children aged 18 years and 10 years. He ran a small canteen at Delaitokatoka, Suva. He reached class 3 level education. The complainant was a 6 years old child, living in the neighbourhood with her family. On 28th January, 2012, after 5 pm, her mother sent her to the accused's canteen to buy some mango skin. When she reached the canteen, the accused was returning from his shopping. They went inside the canteen. The complainant told the accused she wanted to buy some mango skin. The accused took the money from her, and suddenly pulled her to his room.

3. He then forcefully took off her clothes. The accused then licked the child's vagina. He then lay on top of her and rubbed his penis on her vagina. In his police caution interview statement, he admitted he wanted to penetrate the complainant's vagina. [Questions and Answers 26, 27 and 28]. He later ejaculated. The complainant ran out of his room and informed her mother. The matter was reported to police. She was medically examined the same day at CWM Hospital. The accused was later charged for the current offences.

4. The court checked with defence counsel to see that all the elements of the offences were admitted by the accused. Defence counsel said, the accused admitted he attempted to rape the child complainant, at the material time. They were aware that she was incapable of giving her consent, as a matter of law. Defence counsel also admitted, on behalf of the accused that, he sexually assaulted the child complainant, by licking her vagina. As a result of the above admissions, the court found the accused guilty as charged on count no.1 and 2, and convicted him accordingly.

5. Section 208 of the Crimes Decree 2009 prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for ""attempted rape"". Yet, Section 44(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 reads as follows:

""...A person who attempts to commit the offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed...""

	1.	The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment [Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009]. The tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Mark Lawrence Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1990, Fiji Court of Appeal; The State v N. K, Criminal Case No. HAC 155 of 2010, High Court, Suva; State v Simione Talenasila, Criminal Case No. HAC 11 of 2010, High Court, Lautoka. In my view, to reconcile the above authorities, the dictates of Section 44(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 must be followed. It is arguable that, previous case authorities limiting the tariff for attempted rape to 1 to 5 years imprisonment, may be overtaken by the effect of Section 44(1) abovementioned.

	2.	Section 210 (1)(a) and (2) of the Crimes Decree 2009 prescribes a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for sexual assault that involved the licking of the complainant's vagina. I accept what His Lordship Mr. Justice Paul Madigan said in State v Abdul Khaiyum, Criminal Case No. HAC 160 of 2010, that the tariff should be a sentence between 2 to 8 years imprisonment, with the higher sentence reserved for the more serious sexual assaults, and the low sentence on the less serious assaults.

	3.	The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows:
		(i) This was an abuse of a 6 years old child. Children are always vulnerable, and the courts have repeatedly said, they will act to protect children in society, by passing severe sentence.

		(ii) This was also a breach of trust case. Canteen owners in a neighborhood always stand in a position of trust to children who are sent to buy items from their shop. The accused's offending violates that trust.

		(iii) The accused's offendings amounted to violating the rights of this child to live peacefully and happily in the neighbourhood.

	4.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) You pleaded guilty to the offence, although this was 12 months after the first call in court. You nevertheless saved the court's time, and the need for the complainant to re-live her ordeal in the courtroom, by giving evidence;

		(ii) At the age of 41 years, this is your first offence;

		(iii) You have been remanded in custody since your first appearance in the Nasinu Magistrate Court on 30th January, 2012, that is, 1 year 3 months ago.

	5.	On the ""attempted rape"" charge [count no. 1], I start with a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the same by 5 years to 5 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the same by 5 years to 10 years imprisonment. For attempting to rape the 6 years old female complainant, I sentence you, Taniela Ratunaqele to 10 years imprisonment.

	6.	On the ""sexual assault"" charge [count no. 2], I start with a sentence of 5 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 8 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the same by 3 years, leaving a balance of 5 years imprisonment. For sexual assaulting the 6 years old female complainant, I sentence you, Taniela Ratunaqele, to 5 years imprisonment.

	7.	I make the 5 years imprisonment on count no. 2 partly concurrent and partly consecutive to the sentence in count no. 1. Three years of the 5 years sentence is consecutive to the sentence in count no. 1, and 2 years is concurrent to the sentence in count no. 1.

	8.	In summary, your total sentence on both counts is 13 years imprisonment, effective forthwith. You are to serve a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment.

	9.	The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

250705,"SENTENCE
 
  
• MOSESE DAVETAWALU , you were charged in this Court for one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009 and one count of Breach of Suspending Sentence contrary to section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for both counts and also admitted the summary of facts. According to the facts on 01st July 2015, after questioning your wife of her late return, you assaulted her stomach and head causing injuries. At that time you were on a suspended sentence issued on 07/07/2014 for similar offence.
 
 
• I am satisfied that your plea was unequivocal and convict you for this charge.
 
 
• I am mindful that since this is a domestic violence offence and therefore I have considered the Section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree in addition to other provisions in the Decree . 
 

The Law and the Tariff 
  
• The maximum penalty for this offence is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In State v Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78; her Ladyship Justice Shameem held that tariff for this offence is from absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• In “State vs Anjula Devi” Criminal Case No. 4 of 1998 Lab, it was held that the tariff for “Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"" ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment or the more serious cases of assault.
 
 
• In domestic violence cases sentence of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld. (Amasi Korovata v The State [2006] HAA 115.2006S)
 
 
• For breach of suspended sentence the court may impose a fine of 100 penalty units and restore the sentence that was suspended. 
 

Aggravating Factors 
  
• There are number of aggravating factors in this case. You assaulted you wife, the mother of your 02 children and breached the trust placed on you by your wife. 
 
 
• This was committed against your wife and therefore this falls under a domestic violence offence . 
 

Mitigating factors 
  
• In her comprehensive mitigation the counsel has highlighted the following points:
  
• You are 34 years old;
 
• Married with 04 children;
 
• Reconciled;
 
• Co-operated with the police;
 
• Gone for counseling to control anger.
 

 
• Considering the gravity of offending, I select 06 months as the starting point for the 1st count and add 10 months for aggravating factors to reach 16 months. For the above mitigating factors deduct 04 months and for early guilty plea deduct 1/3 to reach 08 months imprisonment.
 
 
• Even though you are asking for a second chance I do not find any valid grounds to grant that. You have pleaded guilty and also gone for counseling which are good mitigating factors. But within a year you have reoffended. Unfortunate thing is your previous convictions were also against your wife. The purpose of a suspended sentence is for reform and in this case you have not learned. Therefore to denounce your behavior as well as to deter custodial sentence is needed. But considering the difficulties that would face by you as well as your family, I would not make any orders with regard to a fine or restoration of suspended sentence with regard to the second count.
 
 
• Accordingly I sentenced you to 08 months imprisonment for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.
 
 
• For the safety of the complainant as well as her children I also issue a permanent domestic violence order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal

2 When these cases were called on 30th August 2010, after waiving your right to counsel you plead guilty to the charge. When questioned by the Court, you informed that you are pleading guilty on your own free will. 

3. According to the summary of facts (which you have admitted) on 25th August 2010, after consuming alcohol with some youths, you have had confronted your de- facto wife for having affairs out side your relationship. Argument had later become aggressive and you have had hit your partner several times. When she ran out of the house, you have thrown a kitchen knife at her injuring her hand. You then have followed her and victim had used a piece of timber in self-defence. However, you have got hold of that timber and assaulter her again on her head. 

4. As a result of your assault victim had received one centimetre cut injury to her middle finger and three centimetre long laceration to her right side of the scalp. 

5. The offence you have been charged carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. According to the definition given in sec. 4 of the repealed Penal Code (Cap 21), ""Grievous Harm"" means any harm which amounts to a maim or dangerous harm, or seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely so to injure health, or which extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or serious injury to any extent or internal organ, member or sense"". Crimes Decree 2009, define ""Grievous Harm"" as follows:

""grievous harm"" means any harm which— 

(a) amounts to a maim or dangerous harm; or 

(b) seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely so to injure health; or 

(c) extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or serious injury to any external or internal organ, member or sense; 

6. According to Abhi Ram v. Reginam [1977] HAA 81/77L 15th August 1977, if an injury to be considered as a grievous injury ""it has to be an injury amounts to a main or dangerous harm under this definition. If the bodily hurt is permanent it will no doubt come within the description of ""grievous bodily harm"". If it is temporary and of short duration and not dangerous, as here, one cannot regard it as more than ""non-grievous"" bodily harm or hurt"".

7. Upon perusal of all the medical reports submitted on behalf of the victim I am satisfied that none of the injuries mentioned in the medical reports could be considered as ""grievous injuries"" according to the above-mentioned definitions. 

8. Therefore, exercising the powers vested upon me under Sec. 160 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009, I convict you for an offence of ""Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"" contrary to Sec. 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009 which carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.

9. According to Goundar J in State v Nayacalagilagi [2009] FJHC 73; HAC165.2007 (17 March 2009), ""The tariff for assault occasioning actual bodily harm ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assaults (State v Anjula Devi Criminal Case No.04/98Lab)"".

10. You are not a first offender and you have 15, previous convictions against your name. So you are not entitled for any discount for your previous good character. Considering all these facts, I set my starting point of sentencing for 09 months imprisonment. To reflect your guilty plea, I reduce 03 months from your sentence.

Aggravating facts

11. In commission of this crime, you have used a knife and a piece of timber against the victim and the victim had received injuries from both these weapons. Considering these facts as aggravating facts, I add 06 months to your sentence.

Mitigating facts

12. You are married with a child and works as a wheel barrow boy. You informed the Court that you are willing to seek forgiveness from your wife. You are the sole-breadwinner of the family and you asked for a lenient sentence. Considering your mitigation, I reduce 03 months from your sentence.

269275,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT
 
 
Gates P
 
[1] On 17th July 2012 in the Nasinu Magistrates Court the Petitioner was convicted of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code. The offence was committed against his biological sister aged 23. On 25th January 2013 he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. The Magistrate had purported partially to suspend the sentence ordering imprisonment at the Corrections Centre for the weekends only. This was clearly an incorrect sentence, for the Penal Code only permitted the suspension of sentences of imprisonment where the term is for not more than 2 years [section 29(1) Penal Code]. The governing provision at date of sentence was section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act which had similar restrictions on suspension.
 
[2] The grounds of appeal against sentence were contained in a letter to this court. The Petitioner complains of:
 
 
 (i) the declaration of the Magistrates Court sentence by the Court of Appeal as being unlawful;
 
 (ii) the failure to consider section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act before imposing the 7 year non-parole period, and that the sentence was harsh and excessive;
 
 (iii) that the non-parole period was a penalty not in force at the time of the offence and therefore a breach of sections 392 and 393 of the Crimes Act.
 

The Facts
 
[3] When the matter of sentence was taken on appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the High Court, the facts were related by the judge in his judgment as follows:
 
 
“[6] The facts of the case were that the accused, an ex-Police Officer, was celebrating with his friends a Police win in a Rugby match. The celebrations had been on-going for some time and it is not in dispute that the accused was heavily intoxicated. He was aged 32 at the time. He had heard rumours that his biological sister, who was the victim in this case then aged 22, was involved in a lesbian relationship and he summonsed her to his home. He questioned her about this relationship and she denied it. He told her that he would “do something to her to make her forget she was a lesbian.” She attempted to run away from him and ran onto the street outside. In the sight of neighbours and his drinking friends he chased her and caught her and put her in so much fear that she lost control of her bladder and bowels. He took her back into the house. His wife was there and she made the sister clean herself up after which the accused kept her in a locked bedroom over a period of three hours while he subjected her to sexual indignities and penile rape. His wife was at all times inside an adjacent room. The accused when giving evidence of the matter says that he was too drunk to remember the details but he did remember having sex with somebody but could not remember who with.”
 
 
Ground 1 – Sentence was Lawful
 
[4] The Magistrate’s order to make the 8 years term of imprisonment a suspended term to be served partially in the community with weekends in the prison was not a lawful sentence. It was not permitted by virtue of section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. That section reads:
 
 
 “26. (1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
 
 
 (2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence, -
 
 
 (a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or
 (b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrate’s Court.”
 

[5] I believe the Petitioner understands that the sentence was unlawful in that where a head sentence is as high as 8 years imprisonment it is not a sentence permitted by law to be suspended. Ground 1 is to be rejected.
 
 
Ground 2 – Failure of High Court and Court of Appeal to consider section 18(2) –
 
Harsh and Excessive
 
[6] The learned Resident Magistrate when considering sentence did not consider fixing a non-parole period [section 18 Sentencing and Penalties Act]. The section provides:
 
 
“18 (1) Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
 
 (2) If a court considers that the nature of the offence, or the past history of the offender, make the fixing of a non-parole period inappropriate, the court may decline to fix a non-parole period under sub-section (1).
 
 
 (3) If a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for a term of less than 2 years but not less than one year, the court may fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
 
 (4) Any non-parole period fixed under this section must be at least 6 months less than the term of the sentence.”
 
 
[7] He could have considered the issue, and declined to impose such a period by reason of “the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender” [section 18(2)]. He simply did not go into this issue.
 
 
[8] Upon appeal the learned High Court judge imposed a non-parole period (on the modified Head Sentence of 17 years) of 15 years. There was no past history of offending or of offending in this grave category of offences – serious sexual misconduct, specifically rape. We can be sure therefore it was the nature of the offence and the unsavoury and horrific circumstances of this crime that caused him to see the need for fixing a lengthy non-parole period.
 
 
[9] The Court of Appeal, recognising that the High Court upon an appeal was confined to a sentence within the limited powers of the Magistrates Court came back down to the original Head Sentence of 8 years imprisonment.
 
 
[10] The Court of Appeal in Livai Nawalu v. The State Cr. App. CAV0012/2012 28th August 2013 at para [4] had explained as follows:
 
 
 “[24] [v] The appeal court must, if it substitutes its own sentence on appeal or by way of revision of the Magistrates Court’s sentence, keep within the powers of the Magistrates Court. The High Court cannot substitute a Magistrates Court sentence with one which only the High Court can impose. The Magistrate is limited to a maximum term of imprisonment on each offence of 5 years [section 7 CPC] now 10 years [section 7(1)(a) CPD] and in total to 14 years where there are two or more distinct offences [section 12 CPC and section 7(2) CPD]. An exception would lie where legislation has specifically enhanced the power of the Magistrate to sentence beyond the usual limit.”
 
 
[11] Had this been an original sentence in the High Court for rape of an adult, the term to be imposed would have been within the tariff of between 7-15 years imprisonment. This point was clear to both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The learned Magistrate could have sent the case to the High Court for sentence. The circumstances of this crime were shocking and appalling. The offending should have been met with condign punishment and marked society’s firm rebuke.
 
 
[12] The suggestion therefore that the eventual sentence, settled by the Court of Appeal, at 8 years head sentence with a 7 year non-parole period was “harsh and excessive” is to be strongly rejected.
 
 
Ground 3 – Penalty of fixing non-parole period not in force at time of sentence. Sentence in breach of sections 392, 393 Crimes Act
 
[13] A similar issue came up in the case of Naitini v. The State [2016] FJSC 6; CAV0034.2015; 21st April 2016. In referring to the Sentencing and Penalties Act Keith J at para 11 said:
 
 
 “... it had been enacted by 16 October 2010 which was the date on which Naitini was sentenced, and the judge was, on the face of it, entitled to fix a non-parole period because of one of the transitional provisions in the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. That is section 61(1) which provides:
 
 
 “A court hearing any proceeding for an offence which was commenced prior to the commencement of this Decree shall apply the provisions of this Decree if no sentence has been imposed on the offender prior to the commencement of this Decree”.”
 
 
[14] Section 392(2) of the Crimes Act provides:
 
 
 “When imposing sentences for any offence under the Penal Code which was committed prior to the commencement of this Decree, the court shall apply the penalties prescribed for that offence by the Penal Code.”
 
 
[15] However the nature of an order fixing a non-parole period has been categorised by this court as not amounting to “additional punishment” Maya v. The State [2015] FJSC 30. At para [27] it was said:
 
 
 “... the fixing of a non-parole period did not amount to additional punishment of the kind which section 3(2) of the Crimes Decree outlawed. It was the court’s attempt to ensure that Maya would not be released from prison earlier than the court thought appropriate, whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission.”
 
 
[16] By way of elaboration of that reasoning Keith J said at para 17:
 
 
 “I do not think that the fixing of a non-parole period amounts to punishment. The punishment which Naitini got were the two head sentences. The fixing of the non-parole period did not increase those sentences. It only affected when he might be eligible for release by the operation of the current practice relating to remission prior to the expiry of the head sentences, but that did not make the fixing of the none-parole period punishment.”
 
 
[17] The section 392 argument was also laid to rest in Maya. Keith J added at para 19:
 
 
 “I turn to Naitini’s reliance on section 392(2) of the Crimes Decree. This was a case in which section 392(2) of the Crimes Decree required the court to apply “the penalties prescribed” for Naitini’s offences by the Penal Code. Those penalties were the head sentences he received. Assuming that section 392(2) required the court to apply only “the penalties prescribed” by the Penal Code, the question is whether the fixing of a non-parole period amounted to a penalty. I do not think that it did – for the same reason that it did not amount to punishment. The non-parole period did not increase the head sentences. It only affected the date when Naitini might otherwise have been released by the operation of the current practice relating to remission.”
 
 
[18] Fixing a non-parole period is not a novelty after the passing of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. Formerly there was section 33 to consider under the repealed Penal Code.
 
 
[19] Keith J saw no real distinction. His lordship concluded the discussion this way [at para 22]:
 
 
 “Secondly, Naitini’s arguments do not take into account the court’s power in section 33 of the Penal code to fix the minimum period an offender had to serve. It is true that the court only had the power under section 33 to fix the minimum period for offenders who commit certain offences, whereas it was obliged under section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree to fix a non-parole period for offenders sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a term of two years or more. But that is a distinction without a difference for present purposes. The fact is that even if it could be said that the fixing of a non-parole period amounted to a punishment or a penalty additional to the head sentence, the power to fix a minimum period which the offender had to serve was available to the court both before the repeal of the Penal Code and afterwards.” [emphasis added]
 
 
[20] That conclusion disposes of ground 3, and this Court must reject that ground.
 
 
[21] None of the grounds raise matters in which the criteria for leave to appeal are met. The petition must therefore be declined.
 
 
Marsoof J
 
[22] I have read the judgment of Gates P in draft and agree that for the reasons set out in the said judgment, leave to appeal has to be refused, the petition of the Petitioner has to be dismissed and the sentence substituted by the Court of Appeal must stand affirmed.
 
 
Aluwihare J
 
[23] I have read in draft the judgment of Gates P. I agree with the reasoning and with the orders.
 
 
Orders
 
[24] In the result the orders of the Court are:
 
 
 (i) Leave to appeal is refused.
 (ii) The petition is dismissed.
 (iii) The sentence substituted by the Court of Appeal of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years is affirmed.

BHUPENDRA KUMAR on the 5th day of October 2013 at Dreketi, Macuata in the Northern Division penetrated the mouth of A.N. a 12 year old boy with his penis.
 
 
2. The brief facts were as follows. Between 3 August 2013 and 5 October 2013, you were aged 44 years 4 months. The complainant was aged 11 years 10 months old. You are related to the complainant through your wife. The complainant lived with his parents. You lived with your wife and 3 children. On 3 August 2013, while the complainant was sleeping in your house, you inserted your penis into his mouth (count no. 1). On 5 September 2013, at your mother-in-law's house at Basoga, Labasa, you again inserted your penis into the complainant's mouth (count no. 2).
 
 
3. On 20 September 2013, you took the complainant to your house. In the house, you closed all the windows and doors. You took off your clothes and told the complainant to suck your penis. He refused and was insulted (count no. 3). On 5 October 2013 while walking to your house with the complainant, you forced him to suck your penis in the bush (count no. 4).
 
 
4. In State v Katokaiti Tutara, Criminal Case No. HAC 050 of 2014LAB. High Court, Labasa, I said the following, ""...""Rape"" as a sexual offence, is at the top of the criminal calendar, as far as sexual offences were concerned. It involved an attack on a person's dignity. It is also an attack on a person's right to privacy. It intrudes into a person's right to enjoy a quality life. Those who find themselves on the wrong side of the law must not expect leniency. The law makers of this country had prescribed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for those found guilty of rape (see section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009). The Honourable Chief Justice via the Supreme Court case of Anand Abay Raj vs The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. CAV 0003 of 2014, had set the tariff for the rape of juveniles a sentence between 10 to 16 years imprisonment. The actual sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors"".
 
 
5. ""Indecently insulting or annoying a person,"" contrary to section 231 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree 2009 carries a maximum sentence of 1 year imprisonment.
 
 
6. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows:
 
 
(i) Breach of Trust. You are related to the complainant through your wife. You are 44 years old, while the complainant was 11 years 10 months old. Your family and the complainant's family were on good terms with each other. You lived close to each other. Because of your age differences, you stand in a position of trust to the complainant. You were supposed to care for him and see he is not harmed. However, you did the unthinkable. You exploited the complainant's trust and raped him on three separate occasions;
 
 
(ii) Rape of a child. As I had said before, this offence is becoming prevalent in our community. Time and time again, the court had issued warnings and deterrent sentences against those who abuse children. A deterrent sentence will be given to you to re-inforce the court's hard stand on the offence.
 
 
(iii) By offending against the complainant, you showed no regard to his right to privacy, his dignity and his right to a quality life. You should not complain when you lose your liberty to atone for your crimes.
 
  
• The mitigating factors were as follows:
 

(i) At the age of 46 years, this is your first offence,
 
(ii) You had been remanded in custody for 3 days.
 
 
8. On count no. 1, I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 14 years imprisonment. I deduct 2 years for being a first offender, leaving a balance of 12 years imprisonment. I deduction another 1 year for his time in custody, leaving a balance of 11 years imprisonment. On count no. 1, I sentence you to 11 years imprisonment.
 
 
9. I repeat the above process and sentence for count no. 2 and 4.
 
 
10. For count no. 3, I sentence you to 6 months imprisonment.
 
  
• The summary of your sentences are as follows:
 

  
 
(i)
 
 
 
Count No. 1
 
 
 
- Rape 
 
 
 
- 11 years imprisonment
 
   
 
(ii)
 
 
 
Count No. 2
 
 
 
- Rape 
 
 
 
- 11 years imprisonment
 
   
 
(iii)
 
 
 
Count No. 3
 
 
 
- Indecent Insult 
 
 
 
- 6 months imprisonment
 
   
 
(iv)
 
 
 
Count No. 4
 
 
 
- Rape 
 
 
 
- 11 years imprisonment 
 
  
 
 
12. Because of the principle of totality of sentencing, I direct that all the above sentence be made concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 11 years imprisonment. 
 
 
13. Mr. Bhupendra Kumar, for raping and indecently insulting the complainant in 2013, at Labasa in the Northern Division, I sentence you to 11 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
14. The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect his privacy.

76655,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] Following a trial in the Magistrates’ Court, the appellant was convicted of insulting the modesty of a female contrary to section 154(4) of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years.

[2] At the trial, the victim gave evidence. She was 14 years old at the time of the offence. The appellant was her neighbour. On the day in question, the victim went to a corner shop where the appellant pulled her from behind and proposed to marry her and invited her to accompany him to a motel to have sex. He said to her that if she refused he would rape and throw her in a river. The victim was offended by what the appellant said to her. She immediately reported the incident to her mother and then to the police. 

[3] The appellant also gave evidence. He said it was the victim who made sexual gestures to him and wanted to marry him. He denied the allegations that he insulted the modesty of the victim.

[4] The learned trial Magistrate believed the evidence of the victim and convicted the appellant.

[5] The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence to the High Court. He founded his grounds of appeal against conviction by challenging the findings of fact of the learned trial Magistrate. Further, he contended that his sentence was excessive.

[6] The High Court did not find any merit in the appeal, and on 6 August 2007, dismissed it.

[7] The appellant then filed an appeal to this Court. On 23 May 2008, Byrne JA refused leave to appeal after concluding the grounds of appeal were without merit.

[8] The appellant now seeks leave to appeal from the full Court.

[9] In his written and oral submissions, the appellant challenges the findings of fact made by the learned trial Magistrate to convict him. He made no submission on sentence.

[10] Section 22 of the Court of Appeal Act (Cap. 12) governs appeals from the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction to this Court. Sub-section (1) provides:

""Any party to an appeal from a Magistrates’ Court to the High Court may appeal, under this Part, against the decision of the High Court in such appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law only.""

[11] Sub-section (1A), added to the Act by the Court of Appeal (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998, provides:

""(1A) No appeal under subsection (1) lies in respect of a sentence imposed by the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction unless the appeal is on the ground –

(a) that the sentence was an unlawful one or was passed in consequence of an error of law; or

(b) that the High Court imposed an immediate custodial sentence in substitution for a non-custodial sentence.""

[12] We have considered the submissions of the appellant. We are satisfied that none of the grounds raised by him constitute an error of law only. It therefore follows that the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. Leave to appeal cannot be properly given in a case where the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. That is the situation here.

[13] For the reasons given, we conclude Byrne JA was correct to refuse leave to appeal.

ORDER

[14] Leave to appeal refused.

1. The accused has been convicted after trial in this Court of the following count. 
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
 RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
 ULIANO SAMUNAKA on 23 July 2017, at Navetau Village Saqani in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of (name suppressed) with his finger, without her consent. 
 
 
2. Kate (not her real name) is a married middle aged woman of the same village of the accused. In the early hours of the morning of the 23 July 2017, her husband was away and she was sleeping alone in her bed. She woke to intense pain, to find the accused on top of her sexually abusing her and invading her with his fingers. She could not shout out to relatives sleeping in the next room because he was forcing her mouth shut with his other hand. He tried to force her legs apart but she resisted, so he punched her twice on her thigh, then left the room and the house. She then managed to shout and alert a young relative sleeping in the next room, who went outside to look for the accused, unsuccessfully. The accused had been with his peers drinking grog and home brew from about 8pm the evening before.
 
 
3. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and sentences for rape of an adult range from 7 years to 25 years (Kasim Cr. App 14 of 1993 – C.A. and Marawa [2004) FJHC 338).
 
 
4. The accused has four previous convictions, one for indecent assault, one for theft and two for assault causing actual bodily harm.
 
 
5. In mitigation, his counsel submits:
  
• He is 27 years old, living in a de facto relationship
 
• He has a son aged 7
 
• He has worked as a farmer earning $100 per week
 
• He is a contract rugby player and is due to take up a contract in 2 months’ time
 
• He is the sole breadwinner for his family which includes his elderly parents, his 3 younger siblings

6. Counsel for the State reminds the Court of the aggravating features revealed at trial:

• It was a middle of the night invasion
 

 Sentence
 
 
7. I take a starting point of 7 years for this offence. To that starting point I add another three years for the aggravating features referred to above in paragraph 6, bringing the interim total to a term of ten years. 
 
 
8. The accused’s previous record reflects a history of violence and sexual assault and while he will not be penalized further for those convictions, he will not receive a discount for good character. 
 
 
9. His alleged prowess as a rugby player and his forthcoming contracts to play abroad are of no interest to the Court and play no part in mitigation in Fiji (see Batiratu HAR001.2012 per Gates C.J.)
 
 
10. I deduct 6 months from the sentence to reflect the two months he spent in remand and the arduous future for his dependents without him.
11. The sentence I pass on this accused is one of 9 years 6 months and he will serve 8 years before being eligible for parole.
 
 
12. He has 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal should he be aggrieved.

78940,"SENTENCE

1 Zihari Rafiq Khan d/o Mohammed Khan this is your sentence. You were charged with one count of Act with Intent to cause Grievous Bodily harm, contrary to section 244(a) of the Penal Code Cap 17 and one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, contrary to section 245 of the Penal Code Cap 17.

2 You pleaded guilty to both counts when the charges was read and explained to you and after you confirmed that you understood the charges.

3 A summary of facts was submitted by State Counsel, which was put to you and you admitted the facts set out therein. A copy was tendered as exhibit 1. A copy of the Medical Report of the victims was tendered as exhibit 2 by State Counsel with the consent of Defence Counsel.

4 I have reviewed the facts against the particulars of the offence charged in this case. I am satisfied that it supports the elements of the charges in the information laid against you by the state.

5 I therefore convict you as charged on both counts. 

Facts For Sentencing

6 With regard to the Act With Intent to Cause Grievous Harm, contrary to section 224(a) of the Penal Code Cap 17, the brief facts were that on 22 April 2008 at about 9pm, Iliyaz Ali, 25 years, businessman of Wainadoi and you (the accused) went to bed with your two young childten Aliana Shama Ali aged 3 years and Nahish Ali age 14 months old. In the middle of the night, Nahish Ali starting crying and was told by you to keep quite. Nahish kept crying because he wanted milk. You became frustrated, took the burning mosquito coil and burnt the palm of Nahish’s left hand. He screamed in pain and agony and his father took him to his grandmother Jaimul Nisha to comfort and soothe the victim.

7 With regard to the Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, contrary to section 245 of the Penal Code Cap 17, the brief facts were that on 28 April 2008 at about 11pm, you took your two children in your family car following a dispute with your husband. You did not have a licence to drive a motor vehicle. The police were asked to assist in stopping you from driving the car with the two young children in it. When the police and your husband tried to take Nahish from the car, you to release him and you attempted to choke his neck and threatened to kill him.

8 On 29 April 20008 Nahish was medically examined at Navua Hospital and it was established that he sustained serious injuries to the palm of his left hand from being burned with the mosquito coil and soft neck tissue around his neck, consistent with the choking attempt by you, his mother.

9 You admitted the above facts. 

Mitigation

10 Mr. Reddy, your counsel had submitted the following in mitigation on your behalf:

• You are a first offender;

• You pleaded guilty;

• You have reconciled with your husband;

• You have sought counseling with a Social Welfare Officer, who have provided a report and tabled as exhibit 3;

• You are undergoing anger management counseling through your religious institution;

• You have spent 2 months in custody before you were released on bail pending your trial;

• You are remorseful and your guilty plea shows you have accepted accountability on your part;

• The fact that there is an issue of bad relations with your husband and his family that is at the back of this incident.

11 From the above Mr. Reddy submits that the court considers a non-custodial sentence as there are special circumstances namely:

• The accused is nursing a 3 month old baby who is breastfed;

• Husband is reconciled with the accused;

• Nature of the offending is such that there no outside persons who had been victimised.

12 Ms Tabete for the State, was gracious, in conceding that from a holistic approach and given the family and domestic nature of the offending in this case coupled with you guilty plea, evidencing your willingness to accept responsibility, a non-custodial sentence may not be inappropriate. She further submitted that the State is concerned about the rights of the 3 month old baby to be with the mother at this very vulnerable stage, especially when she needs to be breast fed.

13 She also opined to the court that if the court was considering a non custodial sentence, that the court take appropriate steps to protects the interest of the victim child having to live in a home with parents, who may be violent towards him.

The sentence

14 I now turn to consider the sentence for each count of the offence charged against the accused. For count 1 with regard to Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm, contrary to section 224(a) of the Penal Code Cap 17, the liable penalty is life imprisonment.

15 In the State v Mokubula [2003] FJHC 164, Justice Shameem reviewed several Court of Appeal and High Court cases on sentencing with regard to offences under section 224 of the Penal Code cap 17. On that basis the learned Judge, concluded:

‘On the basis of these authorities, the tariff for sentences under section 224 of the Penal Code 17, is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. In a case of an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years, depending on the nature of the weapon.’

16 In this case the need to ensure that young children who at vulnerable age, need to be protected by the court, especially against violent parents and the seriousness with which Parliament considers offences of this kind in imposing life imprisonment as the maximum penalty, I would chose 2 years imprisonment as the starting point of the sentence in this case.

17 I have carefully considered the mitigating factors submitted by Mr. Reddy on behalf of the accused. I accept those factors, which I are referred to above. I would reduce the sentence by 6 months imprisonment, leaving a sentence of 18 months imprisonment.

18 I have taken the following aggravating factors into consideration:

• The fact that the victim is a vulnerable 14 month old boy;

• Use of a burning mosquito coil to inflict serious injury on the young boy;

• The fact that the young boy was an innocent victim of the accused problems/frustration with her husband.

For the above aggravating factors I would increase the sentence by 12 months imprisonment to 30 months.

19 For the guilty plea and its consequence in saving the Court’s time and resources, I would further discount the term of imprisonment by 10 months. The term of imprisonment in this case is 1 year 8 months.

20 With regard to the Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, contrary to section 245 of the Penal Code cap 17. I would take the starting point of the sentence as 9 months imprisonment. I would reduce it by 4 months for the mitigation and increase it by 6 months for the aggravating factors. For the guilty plea, I would further discount the sentence by 3 months to 8 months imprisonment.

21 Both sentences are to be served concurrently. This would mean a total sentence of 1 year 8 months imprisonment for both counts.

Suspend or not

22 Mr. Reddy for the accused have asked that the court consider, a non custodial sentence. Under section 29 (1) of the Penal Code Cap 17, a court may suspend a term of if imprisonment if there are special circumstances that warrant such a decision. In considering the issue of suspending or not of the term of imprisonment in this case, I noted the fact that the husband of the accused is reconciled with her and the best interest not only of the victim, but of all three children, especially the 3 month old baby, that their mother is not separate from them. I find support in this from the observation of Justice Pathik in Prem Chand v The State [1979] FCA 30; [1997] 43 FLR 217. I am satisfied that the following factors constitutes special circumstances sufficient for the court to suspend the term of imprisonment in this case:

• The accused has already served 2 months in prison custody while awaiting trial;

• The accused now has a 3 month old baby son, who is breast fed and needs her mother;

• The accused have demonstrated, through her own initiative, to address her own deficiency as a parent by seeking counseling for anger management and to be followed by marriage guidance counselling through their religious organization;

23 This court wish to make it clear to the accused that her behavior towards her own 16 month old son, who was the victim of her assault, was totally unacceptable and reprehensible. You should be ashamed of your conduct. You must continue with counseling especially for anger management. Both you and your husband should take up the opportunity offered by your religious organization to undergo marriage counseling. You should be in no illusion that you were only spare imprisonment on this occasion because of your young and vulnerable children, who stand to suffer the most and unfairly in my view, if you were to serve your term of imprisonment.

24 In conclusion, the sentence of the accused shall be 1 year 8 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years with effect from today.

25 The accused is advised that if she commits another offence during the 2 year operational period of his suspended sentence in this case, the court who deals with that later offence may activate part or all of the imprisonment term imposed by this court on this occasion in addition to that which it may impose on that later occasion.

ORDER

26 I make the following order:

(i) Zahiri Rafiq Khan d/o Mohammed Khan you are hereby sentenced to 1 year 8 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years with effect from today.

81393,"SENTENCE

[1] The Accused above named is charged with one count of Rape and one count of Indecently Annoying a Person punishable under Section 207(1), 2(b) and 213 (1) (b) of the Crimes Decree.

[2] When the case was mentioned to take plea for the first time the Accused pleaded guilty to the charges and admitted to the summary of facts.

[3] According to the Summary of Facts the Accused is 27 years old and the virtual Complainant is 15 years old and they are related. On the 12th November 2012 the victim was woken up by her grandfather to feed the baby. When she was preparing the milk the Accused who came there embraced her and inserted his two fingers into her vagina. On the 14th November 2012 he had dragged her to the bedroom and laid her down. When the mother of the Complainant entered she saw this and complained to the police.

[4] Considering the plea to be unequivocal this Court has found the Accused guilty and convicted as charged.

[5] Law

Section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree prescribes imprisonment for life as maximum sentence for the offence of Rape.

[6] Section 213(1) of the Crimes Decree prescribed maximum sentence for indecently insulting or annoying any person as one year imprisonment.

Tariff:

[7] In a case with some similarities to this case Shameem J in The State v 
Navauniani Koroi (unreported) Cr. App. Case No. HAA0050.2002S arrived at a sentence of 12 years and explained:

""Taking the 7 years as the starting point, I increase the term by two years for the young age of the complainant, and a further three years for the fact that she is your daughter. I add a further year for the resulting pregnancy. I reduce the term by one year for the guilty plea and other mitigation ....""

[8] In The State v Peniasi Senikarawa (unreported) High Court Suva Cr. Case HAC 0017.2008S; 20 May 2003 the accused was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. Shameem J started on the tariff at 7 years. The mitigation was that the accused had a good character, was hardworking and struggling to raise his son single handed. But for being in breach of his position of trust to his 14 year old step-daughter, for the beatings he gave her, and for the fact that she had to give evidence twice, the court imposed a further 4 years.

""The Courts made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.""

[9] In R v M [1988] VSCA 68 (7 October 1998) the Supreme Court of Victoria – Court of Appeal held for the count of oral rape that the accused be sentenced to 6 years. We wish to draw attention to the fact here that the complainant was an adult and also the accused had been charged for other offences in this case. But the seriousness of the count of oral rape still reflects the sentence given and in the case before the Court this involves a child.

[10] Considering the decided case the tariff varies from 2 years to 16 years imprisonment.

[11] Considering the facts of the case I commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment.

[12] Aggravating factors

	a.	The victim was 15 years old;
	b.	She was related to you;

Considering these factors I increase your sentence by one year now your sentence is 12 years imprisonment.

[13] Mitigating circumstances

	a.	You have pleaded guilty at the first given opportunity;
	b.	You are first offender;
	i.	Your elderly parents depends on you;
	a.	You are the sole breadwinner of your family;
	b.	You are remorseful;
	c.	Your period in remand (from November 2012)
	d.	You seek forgiveness

Considering all your mitigating circumstances I reduce your sentence by 5 years now your sentence is 7 years imprisonment.

[14] Section 4(1) & (2) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree states as follows:

""4. — (1) The only purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court are — 

(a) to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances;
(b) to protect the community from offenders;
(c) to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
(d) to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
(e) to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or
(f) any combination of these purposes. 

(2) In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to — 

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 
(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;
(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;
(e ) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 
(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 
(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;
(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;
(i) the offender's previous character;
(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 
(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option."" 

[15] You submit that in your statement to the police you have explained everything accordingly, you had done this act in the process of love making, further the virtual complainant who is 15 years old didn't complain to her mother but the mother had seen you in the bedroom on the second day hugging her. 

[16] You are seeking a suspended and lenient sentence. Considering the nature of the offence I do not wish to suspend the sentence anyhow, every case must be decided on its own merits. Considering the facts of the case and your submissions I find you are genuinely remorseful hence I act under Section 18(2) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree and decline to give a non parole period.

[17] You are sentenced to 7 years imprisonment.

[18] You have 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

82532,"SENTENCE

[1] Peniame Roligalevu, you stand convicted of rape and defilement of a 14-year old victim at Narocake village in Rewa.

[2] On the night of 3rd September 2010, the victim was grabbed and pulled behind a house when she was returning to her bedroom after visiting the washroom outside her home. You threw her on the ground and undressed her. You gagged her mouth with your hand to prevent her from screaming. You jabbed her down with your hand and thighs and raped her.

[3] Two months later, on the night of 25th November 2010, you entered the victim's bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her. This time she did not resist. You knew she was under the age of 16 years when you had sex with her. 

[4] You were an authority figure over the victim by relationship and age. She was your younger brother's stepdaughter who had come to live with her mother when she married your brother. Apart from her mother, she did not have any other relatives in Narocake village. The victim and her mother are originally from Macuata, Vanua Levu. When the incidents happened, the victim did not complain to anyone. But village gossips and rumors led her mother to confront her in December 2010. By that time, the victim had moved out of the village. The victim admitted the sexual assaults to her mother. Her mother immediately reported the matter to the police.

[5] The events that transpired afterwards are unfortunate. There was an existing conflict between you and the complainant's stepfather over your family home. The complainant's stepfather and her mother occupied the family home when the offences were committed. The allegations of sexual assaults against you by the stepdaughter of your brother further divided the family members. Your father held the traditional title of ""matanivanua"" in the village. He was the village spokesperson. By tradition, the title of ""matanivanua"" is considered important in the village context and is passed on to the brothers or sons. The allegations of sexual assaults against you must have been embarrassing for your family. 

[6] I have no doubt in my mind that the traditional status of your father, gave you the authority and influence in the village. By age, you were older than the complainant's stepfather. The court was told that eventually the complainant's mother and stepfather moved out of the family home and built their own home on a neighbouring land. For the victim's mother, her loyalty was divided between her husband's family and her daughter. She ended up presenting a ""bulubulu"" (presentation of yaqona) as a form of traditional apology to all members of your household including your father, for reporting the sexual assaults to the police. The victim attended the ""bulubulu"" ceremony but her participation was not voluntary. As would have been expected of any 14-year old daughter, she felt obliged to participate and she did attend the ceremony, to please her mother. 

[7] After the traditional apology, the victim's mother made her sign a statutory declaration withdrawing her complaint of sexual assaults against you. At trial, the victim's mother gave evidence for you. Your father and your sister-in-law also supported you. The Court accepted the victim's version of facts that she signed the declaration without knowing its contents. 

[8] The young victim stood alone to give evidence. She was extensively cross-examined and accused of fabricating the sexual assaults against you. But she stood her ground and said she was raped and defiled by you. It must have taken a lot of courage for her to stand her ground knowing the consequences of telling the truth might come at a cost for her and her mother. 

[9] In our country, we take pride in our customs and traditions. Customs and traditions should never be used to restrict access to justice. If anything, customs and traditions should be a medium to correct the harm done to the victim by making the offender accountable. Without accountability, relationships cannot be restored, no matter how much traditional apology is offered. This is an exceptional case where customs and traditions were exploited to suppress the truth. 

[10] Under the domestic and international law, the State has positive obligation to bring the perpetrators of sexual assaults against children to justice. Children are vulnerable members of our society. They must be protected from sexual abuse. For this reason, the Court cannot condone any form of sexual abuse against children. 

[11] The offences you committed are serious. Rape attracts maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Defilement is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. 
[12] The victim was a child. The Courts in Fiji have repeatedly said that sexual assaults against children will be met by severe punishment to denounce and deter such offences. 

[13] In Drotini v State [2006] FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005S (24 March 2006), the Court of Appeal provided sentencing guidelines for rape of a child by a family member. The Court said at p3:
""There are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust. The seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family. If the child then remains in the family home, the rapist often has the oportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family.

Cases of rape by fathers or stepfathers appear before the courts in Fiji far too frequently and, in such cases, the starting point should be increased to ten years. Where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances, such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature, threats of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police, there should be substantial increases above that starting point.""

[14] Sentencing for defilement is approached by determining whether there was a ""virtuous relationship"" between the offender and the victim, the age gap between the offender and the victim and any breach of trust (Rokowaqa CA 37/2004, Kabaura HAC 117/2010, Donumainasuva CA 32/2001 and Raibevu HAC 27/2011).

[15] Your relationship with the victim was of trust. That trust was violated when you sexually abused her on two occasions. The subsequent attempt to deflect your prosecution by using customs and traditions further aggravated your offending. Rather than you being remorse for your conduct, you further victimized her by making her offer a traditional apology to you. She was the victim, not you. If there should have been any apology, it should have come from you. 

[16] Your pastor gave evidence of your character. You are a Christian by faith. You have previous convictions but they are irrelevant for the purpose of sentencing in this case. I take into account your personal circumstances and your good character as mitigating factors. You are married with 7 children. You are 36 years old. You support your family by farming and fishing. Any prison sentence will cause financial hardship to your wife and children. But I am not satisfied that the hardship will be exceptional as to operate as a mitigating factor. 

[17] For the offence of rape, I use 10 years as my starting point. I increase the sentence to 15 years to reflect the aggravating factors and reduce it to 12 years to reflect the mitigating factors. I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment for rape and I fix a non-parole period for 10 years.

[18] For the offence of defilement, I use 5 years as my starting point. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, I sentence you to 4 years imprisonment for defilement, to be served concurrently with the sentence for rape.

[19] Your total sentence is 12 years imprisonment.

241479,"JUDGMENT
 
  
• The Appellant appeals against his sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate at Lautoka on 26th June 2018.
 
 
• The Appellant was convicted after trial on two counts of “Indecently Annoying A Person” contrary to Section 213 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009. The information upon which he was convicted is as follows:
 

First Count
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 INDECENTLY INSULTING OR ANNOYING ANY PERSON: Contrary to Section 213 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 Subarmani Mudaliar on the 7th day of October, 2014 at Lautoka in the Western Division, with intent to annoy the said Prashant Levaci Kumar uttered insulting words such as ‘Amar nuni pio’ meaning suck my penis intending that such words be heard by the said Prashant Levaci Kumar which offended his modesty.
 
 
Second Count
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 INDECENTLY INSULTING OR ANNOYING ANY PERSON: Contrary to Section 213 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 Subarmani Mudaliar on the 7th day of October, 2014 at Lautoka in the Western Division, with intent to annoy the said Prashant Levaci Kumar exhibited pornographic material using his mobile phone, intending that such exhibition be seen by the said Prashant Levaci Kumar which offended his modesty.
 
  
• The Appellant was sentenced on each count to 20 months’, 6 months to be served in prison and remaining 14 months suspended for 5 years. The sentences of imprisonment were to be served concurrently.
 
 
• The appellant appeals on following grounds:
 

THAT the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he selected the starting point at the higher end of the tariff which led the sentence being harsh and excessive.
 
 
THAT the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in a fact when he did not give cogent reasons as to the selection of the starting point.
 
 
THAT the Learned Magistrate failed to consider that the maximum penalty for the offence of indecently annoying a person is 12 months imprisonment and the final sentence being more than the maximum penalty prescribed in the Crimes Act No. 44.
 
 
THAT the Learned Magistrate failed to consider a suspended sentence, as the Petitioner was a first offender.
 
 
THAT the Learned Magistrate failed to consider Section 4 (1) and (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, thus the sentence to be harsh and excessive.
 
 
 Facts
 
  
• The victim was 10 year old student at the time of the offence. The Appellant who is a neighbour of the victim had invited the victim to accompany him to the shop. The victim had hesitantly agreed to go to the shop with the Appellant. On half way to the shop the Appellant had asked the victim to suck his ‘dick’ for money. The victim then went back home and when he was about to have a bath, the Appellant had come home and showed pornographic material stored in his phone. The victim reported the matter to a friend who eventually reported the matter to victim’s mother. The victim said it was ‘annoying and disgusting’.
 

 Law
 
  
• It is well established law that, before this Court can disturb the sentence, the Appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999; House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499).
 

Analysis
 
  
• All grounds can be considered together as they challenge the sentence on the basis that it was harsh and excessive. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for indecently annoying another is imprisonment for one year. There is no set tariff for this offence. In State v Yabakiono [2016] FJHC 383; HAC77.2014 (9 May 2016) Madigan J observed:
 

“The maximum penalty for indecently annoying another is imprisonment for one year without a tariff having been set; nor need there be one. There are a myriad ways in which a person can be sexually harassed and the sentence will be at the discretion of the court hearing the matter”
 
  
• The Appellant contends that the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he selected the starting point at the higher end of the tariff which led the sentence being harsh and excessive.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate took 16 months as the starting point. As Madigan J observed in Yabakiono (supra) there is no set tariff for this offence. The learned Magistrate had selected a starting point above the maximum penalty for the offence. Generally when a tariff is set it is set below the maximum penalty for the offence and, according to recommendation by the Court of Appeal in Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013), the starting point should be picked from the middle or lower range of the tariff. However the maximum penalty for this offence being imprisonment period of one year and no tariff being set I do not see a need to apply the ‘Koroivuki principle’ to this case. As Madigan J observed in Yabakiono (supra) ‘there are a myriad ways in which a person can be sexually harassed and the sentence will be at the discretion of the court hearing the matter’. 
 
 
• However selecting a starting point of 16 months, above the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislation, is illegal and wrong in principle. 
 
 
• Having selected a starting point as high as 16 months, the Learned Magistrate increased 4 months on account of aggravating factors. At paragraph 6 of the sentencing Ruling the Learned Magistrate stated “as aggravation factor I found that this is an insult on a young offender and therefore increase your sentence by 4 months in reflecting the same”. 
 
 
• The Counsel for Appellant argues that the charge itself has the word ‘insult’ in it or already incorporated in the offence and therefore the learned Magistrate had double counted the same aggravating factor to punish the Appellant twice for this aggravating feature. It is also contended that by selecting a higher starting point the Court had already considered this aggravating feature at tier one of the sentencing process. 
 
 
• The Learned Magistrate had increased the sentence by 4 months because of the said aggravating fact. It has to be accepted that the word ‘insult’ and ‘annoy’ carry slightly different meanings. ‘Insult’ is a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action. ‘Annoy’ is to irritate (someone) or to make someone a little angry. However both actions are intended to make someone angry. Therefor I concede that ‘insult’ is incorporated in the offence itself. I also accept that the said aggravating feature is deemed to have subsumed in the higher starting point selected. However, the Appellant has insulted a child who was only 10 years old at the time of the offence. Therefore taking into consideration the age of the victim as an aggravating factor is not wrong in principle although an increase of 4 months may not be justified given the higher starting point selected by the learned Magistrate. 
 
 
• It should however be noted that there are other aggravating feature in this offending which the learned Magistrate failed to appreciate. The learned magistrate has failed to consider the age gap between the offender and the victim and also the relationship between them. The Appellant is a neighbour of the child victim and the victim had placed much trust on the Appellant when he agreed to go to shop with him. The Appellant is also guilty in repeating this offence. The child victim was also vulnerable. However I take the view that the final sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment above the maximum penalty prescribed by the Crimes Act is illegal. 
 
 
• The learned Magistrate has not given any discount in mitigation only because the Appellant had failed to file his mitigation despite an opportunity to do so was given. However the Appellant was a first offender and therefore he deserved a discount on that account. 
 
 
• The learned State Counsel agrees that the sentence is excessive bearing in mind the maximum sentence prescribed by the legislation and the sentencing practice in the past. He feels that the sentence ought to be reduced. With learned State Counsel not opposing the appeal, in all the circumstances of this case I also consider that the sentence should be on the high side for this type of offending. 
 
 
• Therefore, having considered all aspects of the offence, Appellant and the victim, I would quash the sentence and impose a fresh sentence that is lawful and proportionate to the offences the Appellant had committed. 
 
 
• Although the maximum penalty prescribed by the statute is one year, when I read the record of proceedings in this case, I found the circumstances to be serious. When the Appellant committed the first offence he had attempted to have his penis sucked by a child for money. When he failed to satisfy his lustful demand, he had shown pornographic material to corrupt the innocent mind of a child so that he could meet his demand. 
 
 
• Having considered the seriousness of the offence and the harm caused to a child victim I select a starting point of 8 months. For aggravating circumstances discussed above, I add 3 months bringing the interim sentence to 11 months imprisonment. Appellant is a first offender. I deduct one month in mitigation. Now the final sentence is 10 months’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• I therefore set aside the sentence of 20 months' imprisonment and substitute it with a sentence of 10 months' imprisonment on each count. 
 
 
•  The learned Magistrate at paragraph 8 of his Ruling considered whether the sentence should be suspended as required by Section 26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act (SPA) because the final imprisonment period fell below 2 years. The Appellant argues that the whole sentence should have been suspended because the Appellant was a first offender and therefore the principle of rehabilitation should have been the primary purpose of the sentencing process. 
 
 
• I do not agree with this proposition. The learned Magistrate had suspended 14 months of the sentence and ordered an immediate custodial sentence of 6 months. I think the learned Magistrate was right when he imposed an immediate custodial sentence of six months given the circumstances of this case. The principle of rehabilitation should be rightly balanced with other purposes articulated in Section 4(1) of the SPA. The victim is a vulnerable child and a clear message has to be sent to the society and to the offender that this kind of offences will be dealt with severely by courts. Special and general deterrence should be the primary purpose of the sentence. The protection of community, specially the need to protect children who are highly vulnerable in our society has to be given special consideration by courts when it comes to sentencing an offender in a sex related cases. The breach of trust on the part of the Appellant as an adult neigbour is also a matter to be reckoned with. And also the Appellant has never been remorseful. 
 
 
• The learned Magistrate has cited State v Nadolo [2012] FJHC 1444; HAC143.10 (23 November 2012) where Nawana J observed; 
 

”Section 4 of the Decree on 'Sentencing Guidelines', has been founded on the jurisprudential principle of 'balancing competing interests' of the offender, the victim and the society at large. (State v Tilalevu [2010] FJHC 258 HAC 81 of 2010; 20.07.2010).
 
 
It is, therefore, of paramount importance for any sentence to reflect court's bounden duty of protecting the community and its unhesitant approach of denouncing the commission of the offence within the prescribed parameters under the law. This can be manifested only by deterring the offenders and others who tempt to commit crime”
 
  
• For all of the reasons stated above, I take the view that the immediate custodial sentence of six months is not disproportionate to the offence the Appellant has committed. 
 
 
• The Appellant was sentenced by the learned Magistrate on the 26th June 2018. Having considered the position took up by the State and the illegality of the sentence, the Appellant was released on bail by this court on 19th July, 2018. Therefore he had served nearly one month in prison prior to the bail determination. Therefore I deduct one month from the imprisonment period. 
 
 
• Following orders are made:
 

 (i). The Appeal against sentence is partly allowed. 
 
 (ii). The sentence imposed by the Magistrate at Lautoka is quashed. 
 
(iii). The Appellant is sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently.
 
(iv). 4 months’ of which is suspended for a period of two years. 
 
(v). The Appellant had already served nearly one month in prison. Therefore, one month is deducted from the imprisonment period to be served. The Appellant’s final imprisonment period is 5 months with effect from toady. 
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

70139,"SENTENCE

[Name of the victim is suppressed. She will be referred to as S.L.]

[01] The Director of Public Prosecution had preferred the following charges against the accused above named.

The First Count

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009. 

Particulars of Offence

Semi Moceituba between the 1st day of January 2013 and the 2nd day of June 2013, at Nadi in the Western Division, used his finger to penetrate the vagina of S.L, a 7 year old.

The Second Count
Statement of Offence
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
Semi Moceituba on the 3rd day of June 2013 at Nadi in the Western Division used his finger to penetrate the vagina of S.L, a 7 year old.

[02] After trial on the charges, the accused was found guilty on all the counts. Accordingly he was convicted on all the charges. 

[03] In this case the victim was 07 years old child and the accused is her step-grandfather. She was in class 01 when accused poked his finger in to her vagina. The accused committed the offence for some time after threatening the victim.

[04] The medical evidence revealed that the hymen of the victim is not intact. The doctor expressed an opinion that this is unusual considering the age of the victim.

[05] Accused took up the position that he never poked his finger into victim's vagina and therefore denied the charges. 

[06] As per section 207(1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009 the maximum sentence for an offence of Rape is imprisonment for life.

Tariff for Rape

[07] In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:

""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent. The sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

[08] In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008). The court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & others HAC 0008 of 1996, the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

[09] In the case of Drotini v The State [2006] FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005 (24 March 2006); the court noted following:

""There are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust. The seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family. If the child then remains in the family home, the rapist often had the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family

Cases of rape by fathers or step-fathers appear before the court in Fiji far too frequently and, in such cases, the starting point should be increased to ten years. Where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances, such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature, threat of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police, there should be substantial increases above that starting point. ""

[10] In State v AV [2009] FJHC24: HAC 192.2008 (2 February 2009) the court stated:-

""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children. Children are our future. The courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences."" 

[11] The accused is 63 years of age lived with his step-daughter's and son's family. He is a retired Public Works Department worker. He has been in remand since his arrest.

[12] In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person""

[13] I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

[14] Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

[15] The objectives of sentencing, as found in Section 4(1) of the Decree, are as follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;

	2.	To protect the community from offenders;

	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;

	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or 

	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

[16] Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a Court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;
(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;
(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;
(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

[17] Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The accused is the step-grandfather of the victim.
	2.	The accused seriously disregarded and breached the trust between 
him and the victim.
	1.	Accused was 62 years old and victim was 7 years old at the time of
first incident.
	1.	The accused took advantage of the trust that the victim had placed 
on him.
	1.	The lack of remorse demonstrated by the accused person for what the victim has suffered emotionally, physically as reflected in the medical findings.
	2.	The accused made the victim to re-live the ordeal again in court in its raw form.
	3.	The accused made the victim sexually active at very young and tender age.

[18] Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

	1.	The accused is a first offender.
	2.	He is 63 years of age and a retired government servant.
	3.	His wife is not living with him.
	4.	He is in remand since 08/06/2013.
	5.	He is suffering from constant spinal pain. 

[19] Considering all aggravating and mitigating circumstances I take 10 years as starting point. I add 05 years for the aggravating factors and I deduct 02 years for the mitigating circumstances. 

[20] Now your sentence is 13 years imprisonment. You have committed the offence on your step-granddaughter who was 07 years old. The act done to the victim by you took away the victim's dignity in the society. You have caused adverse psychological trauma the effect of which is difficult to foresee and assess even by psychologist or sociologist. You have instilled a sense of fear into the victim which may affect her whole life.

[21] Considering all and acting in terms of Section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I impose 10 years as non-parole period.

[22] You have 30 days to appeal.

75927,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] This is an appeal against conviction and sentence.

[2] The appellant was charged with one count of rape at Suva on 22 July 2004. He pleaded not guilty. At his trial in the High Court he appeared on his own behalf. He crossed-examined the state witnesses, unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of his caution and charge statements and gave evidence in his own defence. The three assessors unanimously found him guilty. The Judge accepted that opinion. Later on 15 August 2006 the appellant was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He now appeals.

The Prosecution Case

[3] The case for the State relied on the complainant’s evidence, the evidence of her husband of a recent complaint made to him in the early hours of the morning following the rape and the appellant’s confessional statements.

[4] The complainant is a married women living with her husband and children. On 21 July 2004 the appellant, whom she said that she had not seen before, came to her home at about 1 pm. He said that he was looking for a house girl, named Laota, who worked for a European couple. He told the complainant that the house girl had not turned up for work and that if he could not find her he needed a replacement. The appellant was to speak to his boss.

[5] The complainant said that she was interested in obtaining work. She told the appellant that she wanted to speak to her husband about the proposed wages which she would receive if she took the job. The complainant’s husband came home at about 5.30pm that day. She spoke to him about the matter. The appellant returned later to speak to the husband about the terms of the complainant’s proposed employment.

[6] On the following day, 22 July 2004, the complainant said that she went with the appellant by bus to Suva. They then took a taxi and stopped outside a white house which was closed. They then went to a public telephone where the appellant, so he told the complainant, called his boss who told him to ""wait until 8 pm"".

[7] Afterwards they went to a taxi stand near the hospital and from there to what the appellant described as his ""boss’ office."" They stopped at a house. The appellant told her to go under the house to avoid harm, as male voices had been heard. Later they moved out from under the house. And it was at that time, according to the complainant, that the appellant picked up a glass louvre blade and threatened her. In her evidence in chief she described what happened in this way:

""He told me not to speak. He pulled me and said go to another house. He said come closer to me. He said he would kill me. He showed louvre blade to me. I said I didn’t realize he would do this. I said ""I have got a family. I love my two children, don’t do that.""

Shut up not to speak.

He pulled me and tried to kiss me. He put his hand inside my blouse and started to fondle my breasts.

I could not do anything as I was afraid he might kill me with louvre blade. He told me to remove my underwear. I said I cannot. I am having my period. He then removed my panty. He took me to a smooth surface. He moved my thighs apart. He came on top of me. He put his penis into my vagina and he had sex with me.

He pulled up his long trousers. He told me to put on my panty. Told me to sit there a while then look for a taxi. I hid my disgust. I wanted to tell someone at home. I wanted something to be done to him. He told me he will come next day with wages.""

[8] The complainant also said that when she tried to call out the appellant closed her mouth, pulled her hair and put the louvre blade to her neck.

[9] The complainant ultimately arrived home at about 3 am having travelled part of the way in a taxi with the appellant. When she arrived home she woke her husband and told him what had happened to her. The appellant was to call on the following morning. The complainant and her husband then planned to trap him when he called.

[10] In the morning the appellant called. The complainant said that she told the appellant that her husband was at work. The appellant then went away but later came back. This time the complainant’s husband was waiting for him. There was a confrontation. The complainant’s husband punched the appellant and then they took him to the police station.

[11] Under cross-examination by the appellant the complainant denied knowing him for 3 months prior to these events. She denied saying to the appellant that her husband was cruel to her and that he was not working. Further she denied that she told the appellant to look for a house to rent so that they could live together. Several times she denied that she was lying to the Court.

[12] When the complainant was asked by the appellant did she scream she replied ""I could not shout out for help because you said that you will kill me with piece of glass."" She was asked why she had not complained to the security guards when a taxi was being obtained. She replied that she had not done so because the appellant ""would run away"". She gave the same reason for not complaining to the taxi driver and at a police check point during the taxi trip. She wanted to tell her husband first.

[13] The complainant was medically examined at the request of the police. The doctor who examined the complainant, had left Fiji by the time of the trial. The doctor’s report was introduced into evidence by another doctor at the request of the appellant and with his consent. The report stated that the examination did not disclose any sign of injury although the doctor producing the report, observed that the absence of injury did not exclude rape and that rape could occur without injury.

[14] The complainant’s husband deposed that he had not met the appellant before the day that he called to discuss a new job for his wife. He confirmed that there had been an evening conversation with the appellant on 21 July and that on the following day the appellant was to take the complainant to meet his (that is, the appellant’s) boss.

[15] The complainant’s husband described the complainant’s condition when she came home in the early hours of the morning. He said that she was crying unsteady and scared. She then complained to him that she had been raped by the appellant.

[16] The complainant’s husband confirmed that when the appellant visited the house in the morning there had been an altercation between the two of them.

[17] At the police station the appellant made caution and charge statements. As we have stated earlier the appellant challenged the admissibility of both statements, on the grounds that they had been unfairly and oppressively obtained. The Judge held a voir dire. In evidence on the voir dire the appellant claimed that he was assaulted by two police officers, that he was stripped naked, that he was forced to the floor and that he had a leg put to his stomach. These allegations of violence were denied by the police officers. The Judge preferred the evidence of the police officers and rejected the appellant’s allegations. He ruled that the statements were voluntarily obtained, that there was no element of unfairness and that there was no breach of the Constitution.

[18] The caution statement contained a full confession by the appellant. He admitted going to see the complainant to ascertain if she was interested in being a house girl. He said that he met her on the next day and that he was with her on that day. He admitted having sex with the complainant without her consent instead of arranging a job. He admitted threatening her with a broken glass louvre blade and blocking her mouth with his hands. He identified a piece of broken louvre glass recovered from the rape scene. His statement contained a description of going to the complainant’s house on the following day and being punched by the complainant’s husband. Towards the end of the caution statement he said:

""What I did with (the complainant) I feel sorry for that and next time I am not going to do with anybody."" 

[19] After the appellant was charged he made a charge statement in which he said:

""I want the Court to forgive me for what I did. I admit having sex with (the complainant) I am sorry for what I had done to her."" 

The Defence Case

[20] The appellants case at the trial was in complete conflict with the case for the State.

[21] The appellant, as we have said, gave evidence in his own defence. He claimed that the complaint was a false one. Rather, so the appellant asserted there had been an on-going secret relationship between the appellant and the complainant for sometime before 21/22 July 2004 (in contrast to the complainant who had said that she had only met the appellant for the first time on the day when he came to the house). He claimed in evidence that he was very close to the complainant in his friendship with her and that, indeed, he had started going to her house and sleeping there during the day when her husband was not there. He described going to the town with the complainant waiting for a woman called Loata to turn up, Loata failing to turn up, having a meal with the complainant, taking her in a taxi and dropping her at her place (when she asked him to call at 9 am on the following day).

[22] The appellant denied having sex with the complainant as alleged but he said that they had had sex on previous occasions. He denied being involved in a fight with the complainant’s husband although he admitted being in the complainant’s home on the morning after the visit to the town. Before the assessors he repeated his allegations of violence by the police.

Finding of Guilty

[23] Plainly both the assessors and later the Judge believed the complainant and disbelieved the appellant, hence the finding of guilty.

Appeal against Conviction 

[24] We deal, first, with the appeal against conviction. The appellant’s grounds of appeal, as distilled from his letter to the Court complain of the following errors in law and in fact:

(a) In accepting the complainants’ evidence when there were inconsistencies between her police statement and her evidence in Court.

(b) In accepting the complainants’ evidence when there was no sign of injury and lack of medical corroboration to indicate that sexual activity had occurred.

(c) In not allowing the appellant time to seek representation, and in proceeding with the trial without the appellant having legal representation when he had no knowledge of the law.

(d) In not giving the appellant the opportunity and facilities needed to prepare a defence. 

(e) In remanding the appellant for almost five months occasioning an unfair trial.

[25] We here, note that there was no complaint about the admission of the confessional statements.

[26] We shall now deal with each of these complaints in turn.

(a) Inconsistencies in the complainants Evidence

[27] The appellant does not identify the inconsistencies he refers to. In any event he did not during his cross-examination of the complainant seek to impeach her credit by reference to her police statement. Indeed there was no cross-examination as to her police statement. Prior to the trial there had been the usual pre-trial disclosure. We consider that the appellant cannot now, on appeal, refer to the complainant’s police statement in an endeavour to undermine her credibility. Even if he could demonstrate inconsistencies she was not cross-examined on them. 

[28] In our view, the assessors were properly directed by the Judge as to how they should deal with the facts. The complainant gave evidence which appeared to be credible. There was evidence of a recent complaint from the husband which was consistent with her account of the events of the night. The assessors and later the Judge were entitled to prefer her evidence to that of the appellant. As well there were the confessional statements of the appellant (now unchallenged) which were confirmatory of the complaint’s evidence This ground therefore fails.

(b) Lack of Injury 

[29] The appellant relied on the medical report of the doctor who examined the complainant. It will be recalled that report was admitted with the consent of the appellant as the examining doctor was no longer in Fiji. The examining doctor had recorded that there was no sign of injury on the complainant. The appellant contended that there was a lack of medical corroboration of any sexual activity, that that fatally undermined credibility of the complainant and that the complainant’s evidence ought not to have been accepted on that account.

[30] In this context it is to be remembered that the doctor who was called by the State to produce the report deposed that the absence of injury does not exclude rape as a woman could be frightened and in any event injury need not occur.

[31] Summing up the Judge directed the assessors:

""In the past Fiji has relied heavily on the need to corroborate the statement of a female victim that she was raped. It was said in the past that it was dangerous to convict on the female victim’s evidence alone. That’s because the law traditionally and for very old and unworthy reasons said that complaints of sexual assault by women may not always be reliable. 

Thankfully that position has now changed as a result of a recent Court of Appeal decision in Fiji. So, just in case you think in this case you need to have Lavenia’s statement that she was raped corroborated in any way I am telling you as a matter of law you don’t.

As a matter of law it will only be on the rarest of occasions that a female victim’s complaint of sexual violation will now require some form of corroboration.

So in short it is open for you to find this accused guilty on Lavenia’s evidence alone. However, in this case her evidence is supported by her husband’s testimony of recent complaint and Mr Chand’s own confession of guilt. That may be significant for you.""

[32] The reference to ""a recent Court of Appeal decision"", of course, was a reference to the judgment of this Court in Seremaia Balelala v. The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0003 of 2004S. In that case this Court held the rule requiring corroboration of the complainant’s evidence in sexual cases was counter productive and discriminatory. Thereafter it became discretionary for the trial Judge to give a warning or caution wherever there was some particular aspect of the evidence that gave rise to a question as to its reliability.

[33] Thus it was in the Judge’s discretion as to whether he gave a warning or caution. Here, the Judge did not do so. In our view it has not been demonstrated that he was wrong. There was evidence from the complainant that the appellant held a glass louvre blade against her neck and forced her to have sexual intercourse. The appellant was shown a louvre glass recovered from the scene by the police and he agreed that it was the glass he had used to threaten the complainant. This is strong evidence from which, if accepted that it could be reasonably be inferred that the complainant was in a state of submission. The medical evidence disclosed that a complainant of rape might not show any sign of injury where she was frightened.

[34] We do not see any substance in this complaint and it therefore fails.

(c),(d) Legal Representation and Preparation of Defence

[35] It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. They deal with the series of inter related complaints:

(i) not allowing time to seek representation;

(ii) proceeding with the trial without representation when the appellant had no knowledge of the law;

(iii) being in custody and unable to seek counsel;

(iv) being unrepresented due to financial constraints; and 

(v) not giving the appellant the opportunity and facilities necessary to prepare a defence. 
[36] For us to consider these complaints it is necessary to look at the history of the case from when the appellant was first charged until trial.

[37] The appellant first appeared in the Magistrate’s Court on 26 July 2004 when he indicated that he wished to seek legal advice. He was in custody from then until 24 January 2005. The appellant was committed to the High Court for trial on 10 September 2004. He sought legal aid. On 20 September 2004 he unsuccessfully sought bail so that he could prepare his case and obtain a lawyer. On 20 October 2004 he again applied for bail. By then he had applied for legal aid. He had been told that he could get aid if he pleaded guilty. This advice was not accepted and he indicated that he intended to deny the charge although he still sought the assistance of a legal aid lawyer. Bail was again refused.

[38] By 16 November 2004 disclosure had been completed and the appellant’s request for legal aid had been unsuccessful. A trial date was set for 17 January 2005. The appellant then indicated that he would be able to get financial assistance from a brother in the United States to pay for counsel. There were number of remands on account of this indication. Ultimately the Court was told on 12 January 2005, that the money had not materialized. By then the trial date of 17 January 2005 had been vacated.

[39] On 24 January 2005 the appellant was granted bail. On 11 March 2005, with the trial now scheduled for 11 April 2005, the appellant informed the Court that he would be instructing a lawyer. This was again confirmed on 15 March 2005. Then on 11 April 2005, the new trial date, the appellant failed to answer to his bail. A bench warrant was issued and this remained outstanding until 1 March 2006 when he appeared after he had been arrested on the bench warrant. Just over a month later on 3 April 2006 the appellant informed the court that he elected to appear on his own behalf. A new trial date was given for 1 August 2006, the case to follow another specified case. In fact the trial commenced on 7 August 2006.

[40] It is clear from this chronology that he was given every opportunity by the Court to seek legal aid, to seek funds for counsel and to seek counsel. It does not escape our attention that the appellant had nearly eleven months during the time he absconded from his bail during which he could have engaged counsel.

[41] And as to his lack knowledge of the law to conduct his defence and the absence of representation at the trial we are unable to accept these complaints. Ahead of trial he made a number of bail applications and at the trial he cross-examined State witnesses, he challenged the admissibility of his caution and charge statements and he addressed the Court in closing. We therefore infer from the record that he did have a good understanding of the trial process. In any event, at the trial he elected to represent himself. He did not seek an adjournment in order to brief counsel. For these reasons we conclude that there is no substance in these various complaints and these grounds are accordingly rejected.

(e) The Five Months Remand Complaint 

[42] The appellant separately complains that he was remanded in custody for five months after he was recaptured and that in itself occasioned an unfair trial. We see no substance in this complaint. We have already dealt with the issue of representation and the opportunity to obtain counsel. This grounds therefore fails.

Conclusions on Appeal against Conviction

[43] All the grounds of appeal against conviction have failed. We consider that, on the evidence, the appellant was properly convicted. There was ample evidence (including the appellant’s now unchallenged confessions) to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of rape as charged. The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.

Appeal against Sentence

[44] The appellant complaints that the sentence of 10 years imprisonment was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.

[45] At the time of sentencing, the appellant was aged 41 years. He had had a limited education to class 5 at primary school. He was a joiner by trade and self employed doing some private jobs. He was said to have a good work history. He had previous convictions going back to 1985 including assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, larceny and in 2003, a conviction and imprisonment for wrongful confinement for which he was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and a concurrent sentence of 3 months imprisonment for attempted rape. That was his only previous conviction from an offence of a sexual nature. The present offending was by the far the most serious to date.

[46] The Judge reminded himself of the appropriate tariff for this kind of offending. He referred to the decision of this Court in Mohammed Kasim v. The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where this Court observed:

""We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent... the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must ... reflect an understandable public outrage.""

[47] The Judge took a starting point of 8 years. He then identified the following aggravating factors:

(a) the abuse of trust by the appellant by tricking the complainant into believing that he, the appellant, could obtain employment for her when no such employment was available and this had been the means of luring her into his company.

(b) threats of violence by physically closing her mouth, pulling her hair and putting the glass louvre blade to her neck.

[48] As well, the Judge took into account the appellants’ previous convictions, including the conviction for attempted rape, to which we have referred. Ultimately he concluded that a sentence of 10 years was the proper sentence in all the circumstances of the case.

[49] In our opinion such a sentence was appropriate for the circumstances of this crime. A particularly serious feature of the case was the way that the appellant gained the confidence of the complainant by the deliberate deceit of the offer of a non existent job. He then reduced her to a state of submission with acts of violence and the use of the glass louvre blade as a weapon. As well, there was the previous conviction for a attempted rape. 

[50] The Judge, however, fell into one error. The appellant had been in custody on remand for a total period of just over 11 months. The Judge did not take this time into account. The appellant was entitled to a credit. We, therefore propose to correct this error by reducing the sentence by one year.

[51] The appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 9 years is substituted.

Result

[52]

(1) The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

(2) The appeal against sentence is allowed.

(3) The sentence of 10 years is set aside and in lieu thereof a sentence of 9 years is substituted.

79632,"JUDGMENT

Jese Hellyday Koroicule and Viliame Ravituba the appellants appeal against their conviction and sentence for the offence of rape for which they were convicted on 20 September 1999 by the Magistrate’s Court at Labasa contrary to section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap.17 and sentenced to five years imprisonment. On 7 April 1996 at Cawaira Labasa the appellants had unlawful carnal knowledge of the complainant Ilisapeci Vakasigaleka without her consent. The appellants seek a retrial.

Jese Hellyday Koroicule has filed the following grounds of appeal:

1) The complainant did not appear at the trial to give her testimony and I did not cross-examine her;

2) The injuries as per her medical report were inflicted by her parents which is why neither she nor her parents appeared at the trial to give evidence;

3) The evidence retried on for conviction was unsafe;

4) The learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in imposing a sentence that was harsh and unconscionable;

5) The five year sentence is not applicable as I still maintain my innocence;

Viliame Ravituba appeals against conviction and sentence on the following grounds:

1) The five year sentence is not applicable as I maintain my innocence;

2) The complainant did not appear at trial to testify and I did not cross-examine her;

3) The injuries as per the complainant’s medical report were inflicted by her parents which is why neither she nor her parents appeared at trial to give evidence;

4) The evidence relied on for conviction was unsafe;

5) The learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in imposing a sentence that was harsh and unconscionable;

The grounds of appeal as formulated by the court have been redrafted to avoid duplication and to make some sense of what the appellants were intending. If the court has not properly interpreted their wishes it seeks their indulgence.

The first appellant’s first ground of appeal and the second appellant’s second ground of appeal are identical and will be considered together. The complainant’s evidence is set out at pages 23 and 24 of the court record. She was cross-examined by both the appellants at pages 25 and 27 of the court record. Miriama Qelokai, the complainant’s mother gave evidence at page 27 of the court record. The first appellant cross-examined her at the same page while the second appellant chose not to do so. There is therefore no merit in this ground of appeal because the court record speaks for itself.

The second ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the second appellant’s third ground of appeal. It is to the effect that the injuries the complainant suffered as per the medical report were inflicted by her parents. The medical report is at pages 73 to 75 of the court record. She had a wound on the left side of lower lip consistent with being hit by one of the appellants prior to the rape as she stated in evidence. There was a moderate amount of milky fluid oozing out of her vagina consistent with sperm. And there were pinpoint lacerations on the left upper part of the complainant’s labia minorca and her hymen was not intact. All these findings were consistent with her claim of non-consensual sexual intercourse. There is no merit in this ground of appeal.

The third ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the second appellants fourth ground of appeal. They claim the evidence relied on was unsafe. In their sworn evidence, both admitted they had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However they claim it was consensual. Apart from the act of penetration by the penis of the vagina, there is also a mental element. The appellant must have actual knowledge of the fact the woman was not consenting or was determined to have intercourse with her whether she was consenting or not Ilaitia Korociri v R Criminal Appeal No. 43 of 1979. The complainant’s testimony that the appellants had forced themselves on her despite her lack of consent is borne out by the injuries she sustained as recorded in her medical report. Her hymen had been ruptured, she had injuries to her private parts and there was milky fluid seeping from her vagina. The learned Magistrate believed the complainant despite the lack of corroboration against which he warned himself. There was also evidence of recent complaint as disclosed by the complainant to her mother and aunt and they in turn testified to her distressed state. This ground must therefore fail.

The fourth ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the fifth ground of appeal of the second appellant. They submit their five year prison sentence is harsh and unconscionable. There is no merit in this ground of appeal. The five year prison term meted out by the learned Magistrate is the maximum sentence he can impose. Rape is a serious offence and carries a life imprisonment as a maximum sentence. In the High Court, the offence of rape is viewed with the utmost seriousness because it reflects a proprietorial and demeaning attitude of women. Their Lordships of the learned Court of Appeal have suggested a seven year term as a starting point for the offence of rape. Given those considerations, this ground is denied.

The first appellant’s fifth ground of appeal is identical to the second appellant’s first ground of appeal. They submit they are still innocent. The appellants are entitled to due process. They are innocent till proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They have had hey day in court and the court is of opinion that the learned Magistrate very properly convicted the appellants of the offence of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code on the evidence before him. This ground fails.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed and there is no basis for the appellants request for a retrial which is denied.

70164,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

Introduction

[1] The appellant was charged with defilement contrary to s 156 of the Penal Code in that he had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl then aged fourteen years and two months. Following a trial in the magistrates' court, he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment.

[2] He appealed to the High Court against conviction and sentence. In a judgment delivered by Prakash J on 4 October 2002, his appeal against conviction was dismissed. His appeal against sentence was allowed, the sentence of two and a half years being reduced to a sentence of eighteen months.

[3] The appellant has appealed against that judgment on the grounds that the Judge erred by upholding the conviction in the magistrates' court and by not reducing the sentence to a sentence less than eighteen months.

[4] This appeal is governed by s 22 of the Court of Appeal Act (Cap. 12):

22. (1) any party to an appeal from a magistrates' court to the Supreme Court may appeal, under this Part, against the decision of the Supreme Court in such appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law only (not including severity of sentence).

[5] Mr Shah accepted that, under that section, there was no right to appeal against sentence. The appeal against sentence was abandoned.

Facts

[6] The facts can be shortly stated. On 9 January 2002 six persons including the appellant and the complainant drove to Saweni Beach. When they arrived, the others left the car. The complainant remained in the backseat. It was her evidence that the appellant came to her in the backseat and after some preliminary advances, he had sexual intercourse with her.

[7] The evidence of the accused did not differ significantly from the evidence called by the prosecution except he says that he did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was in the car or otherwise that evening.

[8] The complainant said that after these events she washed herself in water and they drove back to Marine Drive. She said she was ashamed to go home so she stayed with the church pastor and his wife. Shortly after, the complaint was made to the police.

The decision in the magistrates' court

[9] In his decision the Magistrate summarised the evidence of the complainant and the other witnesses for the prosecution. In referring to the evidence of the appellant he said:

""The accused admits the complainant's story except he says that he did not have sexual intercourse in car. . . He further stated that he thought the complainant was over 16 years old due to her size and built (sic) as his statutory defence. . . I have also considered defence evidence but reject it as not true. They confirm everything said by the prosecution witnesses except what implicates them in the crime. The accused denied sexual intercourse at the beach. However, he turns around and says the size and built (sic) of the complainant showed she was over sixteen years old. If he had no sex why would he talk of this statutory defence?
. . .

I also found this accused to blush and evade questions of prosecution on the relevant issues of sex. He did not seem to be a truthful witness.""

[10] He concluded that the complainant's story was well corroborated by the witnesses in the case. He found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Section 156 of the Penal Code (Cap. 17)

[11] The issue in the High Court and in this Court centred on the proviso to subs (1) of s 156 of the Penal Code. Paragraph (a) of that subsection provides that a person is guilty of a misdemeanour who unlawfully and carnally knows any girl being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of sixteen years. The proviso to the subsection provides:

Provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under paragraph (a) if it shall be made to appear to the court before whom the charge shall be brought that the person so charged had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was of or above the age sixteen years.

The judgment in the High Court 

[12] In his judgment on the appeal to the High Court Prakash J referred to the proviso to s 156 (1) and to the relevant passages in the Magistrate's decision. He held that it was clear that the Magistrate did not ""shut out the statutory defence."" He found that the Magistrate did not believe the appellant regarding evidence the appellant had given that he did not know about the complainant.

[13] The Judge went on to say that it would have been ideal if the Magistrate had specifically rejected the appellant's belief in clear words in his judgment. But that did not suggest that he did not address it and reject it. Prakash J concluded that there was no basis for disturbing the conviction.

The onus of proof

[14] The first question of law that arose out of counsel's submissions to this Court was, where there are circumstances that could give rise to the proviso applying, on whom does the onus of proof rest?

[15] It was the case for the prosecution that, in those circumstances, it was for the person charged to make it appear to the court, on the balance of probabilities, that he had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age.

[16] It was the case for the appellant that, in those circumstances, the onus rested on the prosecution to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the person charged did not have cause to believe and did not in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age.

[17] In support of his submission, counsel for the appellant referred to the judgment of Pathik J in Nalasewa v The State Crim App No 080 of 1999, where he had adopted the following passage from the judgment of Grant CJ in Sat Deo Shiri Wasto s/o Chandar Deo and Reginam Crim App No 1/77:

""It is quite clear from this wording that an accused does not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the girl is of or above the age of sixteen; it is only necessary for him to believe it on reasonable grounds. Moreover, it is not incumbent upon an accused to satisfy the court beyond reasonable doubt that he had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was of or above the age of sixteen; nor does he have to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities. The use of the word ""defence"" in the proviso does not connote any shifting of the burden of proof. The proviso refers to no more than an evidential burden so that, for, an accused to fall within the exception created by the proviso, there need only be some evidence, adduced either by the prosecution or by the defence, sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.""

[18] Although he does not say so expressly, we take the former Chief Justice to be holding in this passage that where there are circumstances that could make the proviso applicable, the onus of proof rests on the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defence does not apply.

[19] The issue was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in R v Simmons (1931) 23 Cr App R 25. At that time the comparable proviso was of substantially the same effect as the proviso in s 156 (1). It was in s 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1922:

Provided that in the case of a man of 23 years or under the presence of reasonable cause to believe that the girl was over the age of sixteen years shall be a valid defence on the first occasion on which he is charged with an offence under this section.

[20] The Court of Criminal Appeal held at 27:

""With regard to carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen, in order to make to good the defence set up of ""reason to believe"" the burden of proof rests upon the appellant.""

[21] This same issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in R v Perry and Pledger [1920] NZLR 21. At that time the comparable proviso was contained in s 208 (2) of the Crimes Act 1908. It was again to the same effect as the proviso in s 156 (1). It provided:

Provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under this section if it is made to appear to the jury before whom the charge is brought that the accused was under the age of twenty-one years at the date of the commission of the offence, and had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or over the age of sixteen years.

[22] Hosking J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at 23:

""There can be no doubt that the proviso to s 208 (2) of the Crimes Act 1908 throws on the accused the burden of establishing the defence which the proviso allows - that is, the burden of making it appear to the jury that the accused had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or over the age of sixteen years. This implies that the accused must also make it appear to the jury that he did in fact believe upon reasonable cause that the girl was of or over the age of 16 years. Such has always been the construction placed by our courts on this proviso . . .""

[23] We see no reason why the proviso in s 156 (1) of the Penal Code should not be applied in the same way as the comparable provisions have been applied in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand. Accordingly we answer the first question of law by holding that where there are circumstances that could give rise to the proviso applying, the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age, rests on the person charged.

The decision in the magistrates' court

[24] The second question of law advanced on behalf of the appellant was whether the Magistrate, in his decision, had reached a decision on whether the appellant had established the defence in the proviso. We doubt that this can correctly be considered a question of law only as required by the section, but are prepared to answer it.

[25] Is clear from the passages in his decision we have set out above, that the Magistrate had the defence in mind. He found that the appellant was not truthful. He was also aware of the apparent contradictions in the appellant's evidence when he said that he did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant while at the same time attempting to invoke the defence in the proviso. Further, he had the opportunity of observing the complainant in the witness box and forming his own view on whether there was reasonable cause for the appellant to believe that she was over the age of sixteen years. She was fourteen years and two months, well under sixteen. In Perry and Pledger (above) the Court of Appeal held that the appearance of the complainant in the witness box was evidence to which the court - in that case the jury - can have regard in deciding whether there was reasonable cause for the belief.

[26] We agree with Prakash J that it would have been preferable for the Magistrate, in his decision, to have made an express finding on whether the appellant had discharged the onus of proof resting on him under the proviso. But we have no doubt that the Magistrate had reached the conclusion that the defence had not been established. We answer the second question accordingly.

The result

[27] The answers to the questions of law are in [23] and [26]. As a consequence of those answers, the appeal against the decision of the High Court dismissing the appeal against conviction is dismissed.

253957,"JUDGMENT
 
 
[1] On the 28th July 2014 in the Magistrates' Court at Suva the Respondent, a serving police officer, entered a plea of guilty to one count of assault causing actual bodily harm. He admitted a summary of facts
 
 
[2] On the 20th March 2015 he was sentenced as follows:
 
  
• No conviction recorded;
 
• Adjourned for 2 years;
 
• Bound over in the sum of $2000 for 2 years to be on good behavior;
 
• Commit no other offence in 2 years; and
 
• If no offending and good behavior in 2 years you will be discharged pursuant to s.44 of Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 

[3] The State appeals that sentence on two grounds:
 
  
• That the Magistrate erred in law in not imposing a conviction on the grounds that the accused was a police officer when there was no evidence that a conviction would affect his occupation.
 
 
• That the learned Magistrate imposed a sentence that was below tariff for this type of offending and was manifestly lenient.
 

Facts
 
 
[4] The facts of the case were that on the 9th March 2014 in the late afternoon the wife of the respondent confronted him asking why he had left their child unattended earlier that day. A heated argument arose, and the respondent assaulted his wife by throwing punches on to her face and the back of her head. A medical examination revealed ""bruising and abrasion on the left side of the forehead"". The respondent admitted the assault when interviewed under caution. He entered his plea of guilty at the first opportunity.
 
 
The Sentence
 
 
[5] The Magistrate in her discretion, rather than imposing an immediate penalty, made use of section 44 of Sentencing and Penalties Decree. She has followed the provisions of the section almost completely.
 
 
Analysis
 
 
[6] In her attempt to treat this accused leniently, the Magistrate unfortunately fell into errors. The provisions of s.44 of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree (""SPD"") only come into play after conviction (s.44(2)). Had she wanted to record no conviction then she could have used s.16 or s.43(d) but then the question arises; would this be an appropriate case to do so?
 
 
[7] A ""normal"" punishment for a domestic violence assault is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 9 and 12 months with an enhancement up to 18 months if the assault be considered serious. A judicial officer can of course sentence outside that tariff if and only if he or she gives reasons for departing from the tariff.
 
 
[8] In a domestic violence context, a sentencing tribunal must take into account the factors set out in section 4(3) of the SPD. Unfortunately, despite the word mustcontained in the section, so many judicial officers don't. In this case, although she does not specifically say so, the Magistrate has considered the factors she should. Section 4(3)(d) is particularly relevant which states:
 
 
 S.4(3) A Court must have regard to -
 
 (d) the effect of the offence in terms of hardship, dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim.
 
 
 In attempting to order no conviction and adjourn the matter with conditions, the Magistrate said;
 
 
 ""after considering s.16 of SPD, this Court takes into account that the offence is a minor one and that you have no previous convictions and that a conviction against you will affect your employment, therefore no conviction is entered against you.""
 
 
[9] Whether punching your wife's head, leaving 'bruises and abrasions', is a minor offence or not is debateable. The respondent's counsel refers me to the case of Kumar [2001] FJLR 225 where Gates J (as he then was) was determining the fate of a police officer who had assaulted his wife. Gates J ruled that the accused be discharged without conviction, saying:
 
 
 ""upon the basis that a punishment, if it were to result in the loss of the respondent's livelihood with the Police, would be disproportionate to the crime committed ..........""
 
 
 This case runs counter however to the same Judge's decision in Batiratu HAR 001/2012 where the Chief Justice distinguished the Kumar case and said ""absolute discharges are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances such as where no moral blame detaches, where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty.""
 
 
[10] There can be no doubt that this case is not a technical breach nor one where no moral blame attaches. In these days where domestic violence is very much in the forefront of the public consciousness, police officers who are tasked to uphold the law must be also seen to stay within the law.
 
 
[11] An appellate Court would upset the exercise of judicial discretion in a Court below very rarely, however in balancing here the competing interests of the State and the accused it has to be determined that the strict provisions of the Domestic Violence Decree must flow on to a policeman charged with assaulting his police-woman wife. There is no evidence before the Court either below or here that would say that his future in the Force would be affected but in any event that is a factor that he should have considered before launching a physical attack on his wife who had extended to him very little if any provocation.
 
 
[12] Since Batiratu (supra), it is now a well-entrenched truth in our criminal law that nobody is above the law. The Chief Justice there and this Court here give a loud voice of application of human dignity, equality and freedom as enshrined in section 3(1) of the Constitution 2013.
 
 
[13] There is no reason why there should be no conviction recorded in the present case. The Magistrate's order to the contrary is quashed and it is ordered that a conviction be recorded.
 
 
[14] Punches around the head are potentially dangerous and in this case an enormous overreaction to a dispute over babysitting. The accused having been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm must be punished for that crime.
 
 
[15] Given that the hypothetical plumber from Raiwaqa would receive a sentence of at least 9 months (depending on his mitigation), I would attach a high degree of leniency to this accused's sentence, taking him out of the tariff for the offence.
 
 
[16] On any review where a lenient sentence is to be replaced by a harsher penalty, that harsher sentence should be alleviated to compensate for the accused's reasonable expectation that his case had been dealt with and determined presumably to his satisfaction.
 
 
[17] In addition, the accused had strong mitigation features available to him in that he had entered a plea of guilty to the offence, he was a first offender, he had reconciled with his wife and he was relatively young.
 
 
[18] Pursuant to section 256(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009, I quash the adjournment orders made in the Court below and would substitute a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.
 
 
[19] I confirm the Magistrate's Domestic Violence Restraining Order imposed on the accused as perpetrator and the wife and child as protected persons, which will remain in force until further orders.
 
 
[20] This is a sentence passed in special circumstances and is not to be regarded as a precedent sentence for police officers assaulting their wives.

74658,"SENTENCE
Act with intent to cause grievous harm

	1.	On the 11th April 2014 in this Court, the accused entered a plea of guilty to the following count:

Statement of Offence
ACT WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 255 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
JOSUA DRELINAVAI on the 3rd January, 2014 at Qauia Settlement, Lami in the Central Division, with intent to do some grievous harm to KARALAINI LIKUBUA unlawfully wounded the said KARALAINI LIKUBUA with a kitchen knife.

	1.	Following his plea, a set of relevant facts were put to him, facts which he admitted. He was convicted of the charge.

	2.	The facts admitted are that the accused is aged 31 and employed as a transport assistant. On the day in question, at Lami, he stabbed his sister-in –law over a dispute about repayment of a $20 loan. 

	3.	On the 3rd January 2014, the victim had been in the kitchen after her husband had left for work. The accused was still in the house lying on the sofa in the sitting room. The victim's daughter was also in the sitting room. The victim came into the sitting room to ask her daughter to go with her to Lami Town. The accused asked the victim about the sum of $20 that she owed him. The victim did not reply to which the accused said ""qaraunaiko"" which means ""watch out!""

	4.	The victim went to her room to bath and the accused followed her and stabbed her on the back of the head with a kitchen knife. The victim fell to the floor and blood poured out of her head. She was unable to move her hands or legs. 

	5.	A medical examination revealed that she had a 3cm deep laceration at the right lateral posterior neck. She was hospitalised for 5 days. 

	6.	The accused co-operated with the Police and admitted the offence in his interview under caution. 

Mitigation

	1.	Counsel for the accused tells me that the accused is 32, married with a 5 year old daughter and had worked for a large transport company asa driver's assistant for $120 per week. 

	2.	At the time of the offence the accused had asked for his money back that he had lent the victim but she appeared not to take his request seriously. He was frustrated, took the knife and acted without thought of the consequences. 

	3.	He has no previous convictions with a young family.

	4.	He co-operated with the Police and admitted the offence in his caution interview.

	5.	He is said to be remorseful and has apologized to the victim, his sister-in-law. This has been confirmed by a letter she has written to the court saying that she did not want to pursue the matter any further.

	6.	It is submitted that it was an opportunistic crime and not pre-meditated. He had a sudden surge of anger and acted without thought.

	7.	He has pleaded guilty to the crime which has saved the costs of trial and saved the time of the Court. 

The Law 

	1.	The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. Various cases, but in particular MabaMokubula HAA0052of 2003, have held that the tariff for the offence must be from 2 years to 5 years imprisonment, and more in a domestic violence context. 

16. In the Mokubula case, Shameem J. analysed several cases from the High Court and the Court of Appeal and concluded that in an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range between 2 years and 5 years, depending on the weapon used. She added that a suspended sentence in not appropriate. 

17. Although Shameem J. was considering an appeal of sentence for the identical offence under the Penal Code, the new offence under the Crimes Decree has the same maximum penalty and this Court does now confirm that the tariff is a term of immediate imprisonment from 2 to 5 years, and the nature and danger of the weapon used along with the injuries inflicted will be the determinants of where in that range the starting point is taken.

18. It is to be remembered that reconciliation in a domestic violence offence is hardly ever genuine and it should be only in extremely special circumstances that this offence when it is domestic violence would attract a suspended sentence. In fact sentences for serious cases of acts with intent in domestic violence can attract sentences well in excess of this tariff laid down here. (see for example EmosiTakuTuigulagula [2011} HAC 81 of 2010(Ltk.))

Discussion

19. First and foremost, this offence is an offence of Domestic Violence. Although the victim has written to the court asking that proceedings be stayed, this cannot be done in a domestic violence case. All too often family members are manipulated for one reason or another not to pursue a case against a relative. Perpetrators however must take responsibility for attacks within a family home and all persons, women especially, must be able to live in their own homes without fear of assault or attack. 

20. Section 4 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree (""SPD"") provides special sentencing considerations for an offence of domestic violence which I must consider. It is an aggravating feature in terms of section 4(3)(b) that there was a child presentwhen the attack occurred, and there is the mitigating factor that the accused has taken proven positive steps to accept responsibility for his behavior. 

21. The offence is serious in that it was an attack by means of a knife (an inherently dangerous weapon) on a person in the region of the head and neck. Any attack to the head or spinal area must be viewed with the utmost severity because that is an area that is one of the most vulnerable in the body.

22. It is of course to the accused's credit that he has co-operated, pleaded guilty,and reconciled with his sister-in –law. He is young and has a clear record. 

23. Although the accused pleads provocation, the provocation alleged is very minimal. For the victim to ignore a request to repay his $20 dollars certainly didn't deserve an attack to the head with a kitchen knife. 

24. I take a starting point for this offence a term of 4 years imprisonment. This high starting point subsumes the serious domestic violence attack. For his clear record and relative youth I deduct one year and for his plea of guilty a further year. 

25. The accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. He will serve a term of 18 months before he is eligible to be released on parole. 

26. There is a domestic violence restraining order in effect protecting the victim. That will remain in place until further order.

72306,"SENTENCE

Vimlesh Naidu, the assessors have expressed the opinions of your guilt for the offences of rape and wrongful confinement and you have been convicted of those offences and this is your sentence.

Particulars of the offence of rape are that on the 28th July 2005, you met Barbara Pellizzari in Lautoka. That as a result of conversations that day in the street and a restaurant you arranged to meet her that evening under the guise that it was intended that you and she would be going to a hotel, a place where there would be other people. You then took her in a van to Saweni Beach where some beer and food were consumed and despite her request to return to town, you then drove to an isolated paddock off the Saweni Road, turned off the light, locked the doors of the vehicle and made advances to her. This resulted in all altercation taking place outside the vehicle where you punched Ms. Pellizzari, bruising her, giving her a black eye, you threatened her saying you had a knife, you forced her to be scared, to be frightened, in her words to be terrified to the point where she realizing she was unable to escape, sought some protection by offering a condom for use. You then despite her resistance continued to force yourself upon her and ultimately committed rape. 

You denied the commission of the offence when you were interviewed by the police and you gave to the police a version of events very different from those facts that have been found by the court. 

You are a taxi driver. You were in Naviti Street, Lautoka, on the 28th July 2005 as a taxi driver, as a public service vehicle operator, when you were approached in a friendly fashion by Ms. Pellizzari. Ms. Pellizzari was in Lautoka as a tourist, a tourist from Italy, she arrived in this country on the 21st July 2005 from Australia and she had been to various resorts prior to coming to Lautoka on that day. You took advantage of her. She sought from you guidance and assistance to find a restaurant and social contact in going to a hotel in the company of others. You abused your position in the extreme. This country is very dependent upon the tourist industry and conduct such as yours does little to encourage young people to visit this country. It discourages people from doing so. It detracts from the friendly nature that is portrayed overseas of the population of this country. You have betrayed not just yourself, not just your family but the population of your country by your conduct. 

You have today after your conviction expressed your contrition and you have apologized to Ms. Pellizzari for what you have done. I take that into account. It is trite to say that is too little too late.

Ms. Pellizzari and other people like her, whether they be tourists or not, they are entitled to go about their business to be able to speak to males in public places without being exposed to conduct such as yours. 

You come before the court as a 25 year old married man with a child, 1 year and 4 months old. You have been educated to Form 5. You left school in 1999 and it appears you have been continually in employment since leaving school and since 2002, you have been driving taxis.

You have a prior conviction that is in 2001 in Suva for indecent annoying a female. You received a fine of $100.00.

The Fiji Court of Appeal in Mohammed Kasim v The State – Cr. App. No. 21 of 1993 set forth that the starting point for sentencing an adult for rape without aggravation or mitigation should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years.

The Fiji Court of Appeal in Beramaiwai v The State – AAU0032 of 2003S in a judgment delivered on the 18th March 2005 dismissed an appeal from Madam Justice Shameem, where a sentence of 7 years imprisonment for a public service vehicle driver for a charge of rape and in doing so, the court said:

“We agree with the judge that the breach of the appellant’s position of trust as the driver of the public service vehicle was a very serious aggravating factor. She was right to lay emphasis on that. The public is entitled to expect to be safe when using any public service vehicle.”

Taking account of the authorities to which I have referred, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences, your antecedents and the matters that you have placed before the court in mitigation, including the contrition that you have shown following your conviction, I am of the opinion that an appropriate sentence is a period of imprisonment of 9 years and accordingly with respect to the charge of rape, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 9 years and with respect to the second count of wrongful confinement, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months and I order that both sentences be served concurrently.

269925,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Calanchini P
 
 
[1] I have read the judgment of Chandra JA and agree that the appeal should be allowed and the sentence varied as proposed in his judgment.
 
 
Chandra JA
 
 
[2] The Appellant was charged with one count of rape contrary to sections 207(1) and section 207(2) of the Crimes Decree 2009.
 
 
[3] The facts admitted by the Appellant were that he was staying with the victim's family, he being related to the victim's father. The mother had left the house to visit the father in hospital and left the victim who was 9 years old and her elder brother in the care of the Appellant. After dinner the two children had gone to sleep on a mattress. The boy had asked the Appellant to sleep on the mattress with them, as their mother had not returned. The Appellant had blown out the candle and joined them on the mattress. The boy had told the victim to lie in the middle between him and the Appellant. While lying down the Appellant had pulled down the victim's panties and used his fingers to indecently invade her. The victim had felt pain and tried to push his hand away, but the Appellant had persisted. The next morning the victim had told her mother about the incident and the Appellant had been chased away and the Police had been informed.
 
 
[4] At the trial the Appellant had pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. 
 
 
[5] The Appellant appealed against his sentence and was granted leave. The grounds of appeal relied on according to the written submissions filed were the following:
 
  
• The learned High Court Judge erred in fact and law when he failed to deduct the time the Appellant spent in remand.
 
 
• The learned trial Judge erred in fact and law when he failed to justify the imposition of a non-parole period considering the circumstances of the Appellant.
 

[6] Counsel for the Appellant at the hearing of the Appeal sought leave to pursue a further ground of appeal that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive as the starting point taken in sentencing the Appellant was high which resulted in the sentence that was finally imposed.
 
 
[7] Counsel for the Appellant submitted that he was not pursuing the 2nd ground of appeal but pursued with the first ground of appeal and the ground of appeal set out orally at the argument stage for which he sought leave.
 
 
[8] The Court allowed the Appellant to pursue the added ground of appeal and both parties made oral submissions regarding same.
 
 
Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal
 
 
[9] The first ground of appeal was as regards the failure of the learned High Court Judge to take into account the period that the Appellant was in remand when imposing the sentence.
 
 
[10] The facts set out in the record of the High Court were not very clear as to the exact period of remand but however, both Counsel agreed that the period of remand was about 3 months and Counsel for the Respondent conceded that the said period had not been taken into account when the sentence was imposed.
 
 
[11] The law relating to this position of taking into account the period in remand when imposing a sentence has been clearly laid down in several decisions of the Court of Appeal.
 
 
[12] Section 24 of the Sentences and Penalties Decree 2009 provides:
 
 
""If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court considers otherwise orders, be regarded by the Court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.""
 
 
[13] In Kean v The State [2013] FJCA 14; AAU0018 of 2008 (5 March 2013) it was decided by the Court of Appeal that as a matter of sentencing principle, the sentencing court should make a downward adjustment to the sentence for a period that the accused spent in custody on remand before sentence. Accordingly, a period of 5 months was deducted being the period spent in remand before trial.
 
 
[14] In Naivalurua Koroitavalena v State [2014] FJCA 185; AAU0051 of 2010 (5 December 2014) it was stated referring to Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009:
 
 
""[20] This section mandates the trial Judge to deduct the period that an accused is held in custody prior to the trial when imposing a sentence. However, if the trial Judge is of the view that such period should be so deducted, he should give reasons for not doing so."" 
 
 
[15] In the present case, the learned High Court Judge had not deducted the period that the Appellant had been in remand which as stated above was three months nor had he given reasons for not doing so.
 
 
[16] Therefore the Appellant is entitled to a deduction of three months from the period of imprisonment imposed on him.
 
 
[17] The Appellant was not pursuing the second ground of appeal. However, it would be relevant to state the position set out regarding the imposition of the non parole period relating to Section18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 in the case of Savu v State [2014] FJCA 208; AAU0090 of 2012 (5 December 2014) to the following effect:
 
 
""Section 18 subsection (1) has to be read subject to sub section (2) The effect of thee two provisions is that an offender who is imprisoned for 2 years or more must be subject to a non-parole period unless due to the nature of the offence, or the past history of the offender, fixing a non-parole period is inappropriate. In other words, fixing a non-parole period for a term of 2 years or more is mandatory unless for the limited reasons provided by subsection(2) the court declines to fix one. It therefore follows that when the court fixed a non-parole period under sub section (1), the court is not required to give reasons for its decision because the provision is mandatory. However, if the court declines to fix a non-parole period then the court must give reasons for exercising the discretion under subsection (2).""
 
 
[18] The new ground of appeal which the Court allowed to pursue when Counsel sought leave when arguing the case for the Appellant was as regards the harshness of the sentence on the basis of the higher starting point adopted by the learned High Court Judge in sentencing the Appellant.
 
 
[19] The following observations were made by the Court of Appeal in Drotini v The State [2006] FJCA 26; AAU0001 of 2005S (24 March 2006) regarding sentencing in cases of rape specially involving child victims by relatives:
 
 
""[16] There are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust. The seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family. If the child then remains in the family home, the rapist often has the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family.
 
 
[17] Cases of rape by fathers or step fathers appear before the courts in Fiji far too frequently and, in such cases, the starting point should be increased to ten years. Where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances, such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature, threats of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police, there should be substantial increases above that starting point.""
 
 
[20] The victim in Drotini's case was 9 or 10 years old and was the step daughter of the accused and was convicted of one count of indecent assault and two counts of rape. The starting point for sentencing was ten years and the final sentence was 11 years imprisonment.
 
 
[21] In Anand Abhay Raj v The State [2014] FJSC 12. CAV0003 of 2014 (20 August 2014) the Supreme Court affirmed the sentence of 16 years imprisonment where the accused who was the step father was convicted of raping a child who was 10 years old, there being four counts of rape and one count of indecent assault. The starting point of the sentencing by the High Court Judge was 12 years which ultimately was made up to 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years.
 
 
[22] Drotini's case and Raj's case were cases where there was penile rape of the young victims on more than one occasion whereas in the present case the rape was not a penile rape but one when the Appellant had used his fingers to abuse the victim. This was the only occasion regarding which the Appellant was charged with. That however, does not take away the trust reposed on him when the victim was placed in his care by her mother.
 
 
[23] In the present case the learned High Court Judge commenced sentencing at a starting point of 14 years whereas in Drotini's case the starting point was 10 years and in Raj's case the starting point was 12 years, which were cases where there were penile rapes on more than one occasion. In those circumstances, the starting point of 14 years adopted by the learned High Court Judge in this case is too high. It would have been appropriate if the starting point was 12 years and adopting the methodology adopted by the learned High Court Judge, the aggravating circumstances would increase the term to 14 years. The deductions allowed were 2 years for demonstrable remorse and religious mitigation and a further 3 years for the guilty plea which would result in the final term being 9 years. The three months that he spent in remand would be deducted resulting in the term being 8 years and 9 months. 
 
 
[24] This would be a fit case to interfere with the sentence that was imposed on the Appellant. The sentence of 11 years imposed on the Appellant is quashed and substituted with a sentence of 8 years and 9 months from 12th October 2011 with a non parole period of 7 years and six months.
 
 
Jayasuriya JA
 
 
[25] I had the opportunity to read the draft judgment of Chandra JA. I agree with Chandra JA's decision to allow the appeal and vary the sentence for the reasons stated therein.
 
 
Orders of Court
 
 
The Appeal of the Appellant is allowed to the extent that the sentence of 11 years imposed on him by the learned trial Judge is quashed and substituted with a sentence of 8 years and 9months with a non-parole period of 7 years and six months.

79669,"SENTENCE

	1.	You Peni Koroi Tamana are here today to be sentenced following the admission of ‘guilt’ on your own accord and free will in this court on 15.10.2012, for committing the offence of Indecent assault contrary to section 212 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

	2.	The facts you agreed before this Court disclosed that you committed this offence on 13.10.2012 at the Post Fiji Arcade in Suva. Victim of the incident had been a 17 year old school girl. 

	3.	She has come to a restaurant in the arcade at around 8.15 pm with her sister and mother. You then approached her. All of a sudden you grabbed and squeezed her right buttock. Thereafter you tried to walk away. 

	4.	The victim got annoyed from the sudden incident and called out you to stop. But you continued to walk away. However victim’s mother and the other sister managed to apprehend you. Later you were handed over to the police.

	5.	You admitted the allegation during the caution interview which was conducted at the Totoga police station. Accordingly the Court convicts you for the offence of Indecent assault.

	6.	The maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment. The case of Rokota v State Criminal Appeal HAA0068 of 2002 established the tariff for  indecent assault to range from 12 months to 4 years imprisonment. Although Rokota's case was considered under the repealed Penal Code, the principles are applicable under the Crimes Decree, because the maximum penalty is the same.

In Rokota, Shameem J stated,

""The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect of the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence"".

	1.	It is to be noted that you have assaulted the victim at a place where the public was present. There is no doubt that the victim may have undergone considerable embarrassment due to the incident. 

	2.	Having considered the circumstances I select 12 months as the starting point of your sentence.

	3.	You assaulted the victim in the vicinity of her sister and mother. Also I note that she has been a 17 year old student at the time of the incident. These are aggravating factors of your offence. I will increase your sentence by another 12 months to reflect the same. Now the sentence stands at 24 months.

	4.	In mitigation you stated that you are a 21 year old university student. You were remorseful and pleaded for a lenient sentence as you were under the influence of liquor at the time.

	5.	However I note that voluntary intoxication is not a ground to consider in mitigation. Early plea on the first available opportunity will take 1/3 of your sentence off. Therefore your sentence is now 16 months.

	6.	Previous good character and young age will further bring down your sentence by 4 months.

	7.	This will leave your final sentence at 12 months.

	8.	The Court is mindful that a sentence below 2 years is eligible for a suspension. At the same time I note that the Court has a duty to protect the victims specially those who are in their young age. Young girls should always feel safe at public places such as restaurants, shops and streets of the city. 

	9.	I note that the previous good character of the offender and his young age can be used to justify suspending the sentence of these types of cases. Suspended sentence is also a prison term. The only difference is that you will serve this term while attending to your day to day work.

	10.	Therefore Peni Koroi Tamana today you are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Your sentence is suspended for 3 years.

	11.	If you commit any offence during the suspended period of 3 years and if found guilty by the Court you are liable to be sent to the prison, to serve the above mentioned imprisonment period which is suspended by this Court.

	12.	You may appeal to the High Court against this order, within 28 days.

250848,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. On the 14th April the Accused entered an unequivocal plea to a count of rape of a 7 year old girl in Naweni (in this Northern Division) on the 5th February 2017.
 
 
2. He agreed an appropriate set of facts upon which he was convicted.
 
 
Facts
 
 
3. The facts reveal that in the evening of the date in question, the accused had been drinking with others and he returned to a tent where he usually slept. The victim, aged 7 at the time was sleeping alone in the tent when he returned. The child’s mother usually slept in the tent but on this occasion she was at a house nearby drinking kava. There was just the accused and the young girl alone in the tent. 
 
 
4. The accused moved close to the girl and removed her panty. He used his finger to invade her whilst at the same time he was pleasuring himself. He continued to use his finger on the girl until feeling sudden pain in her vagina, she awoke, crying. Just at that moment, the mother came back and saw the activity. The child told the mother what the accused had done to her. 
 
 
5. The accused confessed to a church elder that evening, and when interviewed by the Police he freely admitted his transgression.
 
 
The Accused
 
 
6. The accused was born on the 12th December 1998, meaning that at the time of the offence he was only two months from being a Juvenile.
 
 
7. At the time, he was living with his mother in a village where he did some subsistence farming. He also worked as a labourer on a school construction site where he earned a small amount of money.
 
 
8. He had at the end of 2016 dropped out of school because of the financial pressures on his family.
 
 
9. He has a clear record, making him a first offender.
 
 
The Law
 
 
10. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the tariff for rapes of children is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 10 and 16 years. (Anand Abhay Raj CAV003 of 2014).
 
 
11. Meaningful discounts must be afforded to the accused for his youth, his clear record and his co-operation with the authorities. His plea of guilty before this Court will also be recognized; a plea that has saved the Court’s time and more importantly has saved the very young child having to relive this trauma and give evidence of a sexual nature.
 
 
This Sentence
 
 
12. The Court is very conscious of the extreme youth of this accused. Only two months earlier he passed from being a juvenile to becoming an adult in law; however at 18 he is still a child and children do impetuous things without realizing the consequences of their actions.
 
 
13. As this Court said very recently in Fabiano HAC14 0f 2016,
 
 
 “The courts have always been at pains to treat young offenders with mercy and to keep them from the baneful and corrupting influences of an adult prison community. Such good intentions however must be balanced with the seriousness of the offence he (or she) is convicted of.”
 
 
14. The rape of a child is a serious crime indeed, especially a child of 7 years old. At that age she knows what is happening and the literature tells us that the trauma of such an event can have very serious repercussions indeed on her mental and sexual development. 
 
 
15. It is my judicial duty to take a starting point in the range set down by the Supreme Court, that is within the range of 10 to 16 years. I take a starting point of 10 years imprisonment. 
 
 
16. There is aggravation of the offence in that there has been a breach of trust. The mother, allowing the accused to sleep in the tent with her and her daughter, trusts that the accused will molest neither her nor the child and the accused has breached that trust. I add 2 years to the sentence to reflect that breach. 
 
 
17. Despite the heinous abuse, the accused has a good deal of mitigation to his credit. He is very remorseful and he has co- operated with the authorities from the outset. He has a hitherto clear record and he has spent over 2 months in remand awaiting these proceedings. For this considerable mitigation I deduct 2 years from his sentence bringing it back to ten years.
 
 
18. His very early guilty plea has saved the child and her mother from reliving this ordeal and has saved Court time. For that plea I deduct a further two years from the sentence making a total sentence of 8 years. That is the sentence that this Court passes on the accused. 
 
 
19. It is inevitable and regrettable that because of the seriousness of his abuse that he will have to spend years of his progress to full maturity in the company of hardened convicts; but he must be given the opportunity of redemption and a chance to be once again a useful member of his rural community.
 
 
20. It is for that reason that this sentence in one that outside the tariff, and it must in no way be used to distort the tariff already laid down by the Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj (supra).
 
 
21. It is also for that reason that I decline to set a minimum term that he serve before being eligible for parole.
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
22. The accused is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with no minimum term to be served before being eligible to apply for parole.

257860,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused is before the Court for sentence, after being convicted to the following charges;
 
 
Count No. 1
 
 
Statement of offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of the offence
 
 
Sevenaia Sigabana on the 7th day of April 2013 at sector 4, Lomaivuna, Naitasiri, in the Eastern Division, penetrated the vagina of Lanieta Adimaibure with his fingers, without the consent of the said Lanieta Adimaibure
 
 
Count No. 2
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
INDECENT ASSAULT:  contrary to section 212 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009
 
 
Particulars of the offence
 
 
Sevenaia Sigabana from the 28thday of April 2013 to the 18th day of May 2013 at sector 4 Lomaivuna, Naitasiri, in the Eastern Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted Lanieta Adimaibure.
 
 
[2] You pleaded not guilty to above charges. The ensuing trial lasted for two days in this Court during which the victim, you and your wife gave evidence.
 
 
[3] At the conclusion of the trial, this Court; having considered the unanimous verdict of guilty returned by the assessors on both these counts and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial, decided to accept the opinion of the assessors in respect of the charges and found you guilty and convicted of the said charges.
 
 
[4] The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. 
 
 
 (i) The victim in this case was 18 years old at the time of the incident. You are her step father and married to her mother for 10 years. You have inserted your fingers into the vagina of Lanieta Adimaibure when she was sleeping on her bed in the morning hours of 7th April 2013. 
 
 (ii) In addition, on a subsequent date you have kissed her mouth and put your tongue into her mouth. On another day you have watched Lanieta Adimaibure using washroom.
 

 [5] According to section the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence. 
 
 
[6] The tariff for rape of an adult is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates (as he was then) in State v Marawa  [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years. I have also considered the judgment of the Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12 where it had dealt with similar factual situation.
 
 
[7] In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed thus:
 
 
""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
 
[8] The Offence of Indecent Assault attracts a punishment of five years as per section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree.
 
 
[9] I have followed the guidelines laid down by Justice Shameem in Rokota v State [2002] FJHC168, in determining the tariff for Indecent Assault count against you.
 
 
[10] As already noted by this Court in the preceding paragraphs, you have; in committing indecent assault on your step daughter, put your tongue into her mouth. In addition you watched her using washroom. 
 
 
[11] However, the Court noted that even though there is bodily contact between you and your step daughter there was no use of genitalia in the commission of offence, as per the judgment of State v. Laca [2012] FJHC 1414 where Hon. Justice P. Madigan referring to the United Kingdom's Legal guidelines for Sentencing categorized sexual assault into following 3 categories;
 
 
Category 1 (the most serious)
 
Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia, face or mouth of the victim.
 
 
Category 2
 
 
(i) Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
 
 
(ii) Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
 
(iii) Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 
 
Category 3
 
 
Contact between parts of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia).
 
 
[12] Therefore, your act of Indecent Assault on you step daughter is identified as an instance satisfying category 3.
 
 
[13] Considering the above circumstances, I commence your sentence at 9 years imprisonment for the charge of Rape.
 
 
[14] The aggravating factors are:
 
 
(i) Serious breach of trust by the victim towards you, being her step father,
 
 
(ii) Victim is relatively of young age,
 
 
(iii) Your lack of remorse by letting the victim relive her experience in Court,
 
 
(v) You took advantage of the victim's vulnerability,
 
 
(vi) You displayed total disregard of the victim's safety and wellbeing,
 
 
(vii) You have instilled insecurity in the minds of other children with your illegal actions.
 
 
[15] I add 4 years for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 13 years.
 
 
[16] The mitigating factors are:
 
 
 (i) You are a first offender as conceded by the State ( the three previous convictions are over 10 years and are disputed by the accused), 
 
 (ii) You are a 44 year old subsistence farmer and sole breadwinner,
 

(ii) You are married with four step children,
 
 
 (iii) your wife is having a physical illness,
 
 (iv) You have provided for your step children for over the past 8 years,
 
 (v) You have provided for the education of the victim,
 
 (vi) You have committed rape by insertion of your fingers and not by your penis,
 
 (vii) One incident and no repetition.
 

[17] I deduct 3 years for the above mitigating factors. Now the sentence is 10 years.
 
 
[18] In respect of the count of Indecent Assault, I impose a 3 year sentence of imprisonment.
 
 
[19] You were in remand for this case for a period of one week and were on bail thereafter and throughout the continuation of trial. The judgment of Bavoro v State [2013] FJHC 1 recognised that an ""appropriate reduction in the sentence to reflect the appellant's remand period"" could be made under section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No. 42 of 2009. Considering the duration of the period you spent in remand I do not make order of any reduction from the period of imprisonment.
 
 
[20] Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 8 years of a non- parole period.
 
 
[21] Your sentences are as follows:
 
 
 (i) Count of Rape - 10 years imprisonment
 (ii) Count of Indecent Assault – 3 years imprisonment
 

Summary
 
 
[22] You are sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 8 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[23] Considering the totality principle, I order both these sentences to run concurrently.
 
 
[24] You have 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

78723,"JUDGMENT

1. On the 9th June 2010 in the Magistrates Court at Suva the respondent entered a plea of guilty to the following charge:

Statement of Offence (a)
ABDUCTION OF GIRL UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS WITH INTENT TO HAVE CARNAL KNOWLEDGE: Contrary to Section 211[1] of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence (b)

SHIWAN KARTIK on the 6th day of April 2010, at Nasinu in the Central Division unlawfully abducted ASHNA ARTIKA SAMI, an unmarried girl under the age of 16 years, 11 months and 18 days out of the possession and against the will of her parents.

2. The facts of the case were that on the 6th day of April 2010 at Nasinu, he had taken away a girl of 16 years, eleven months from her home to a motel in Suva where they spent the night before he returned her at 11 am the next morning. The girl's parents had already reported her missing and the accused and the girl went to Nakasi Police Station to help with enquiries. The accused admitted the offence to Police under caution. He admitted that he took the girl away with intent to have carnal knowledge of her.

3. In mitigation the accused told the Court that he is 22 years old and worked as an electrician earning $180.00 per week. He lives with his parents and supports them. He claims that he and the girl are friends and it is his intention to marry her when she reaches 18 years of age.

4. The learned Magistrate found that it was an aggravating feature that there was an age difference of 6 years between the two as well as interference with the ""possessory rights"" of the parents. However, that second ""aggravating feature"" is subsumed in the particulars of the offence.

5. The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment but the tariff is from 12 months to three years.

6. In sentencing the accused, the learned Magistrate after making adjustments for mitigating and aggravating features arrived at a sentence of four years imprisonment which she suspended for five years.

7. The state appeals the sentence on the ground that it is wrong in law. 

8. By the terms of Section 26(2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, a Magistrate may only suspend a sentence that does not exceed two years. The state quite properly therefore claims that the sentence is wrong in law.

9. Pursuant to Section 256(2) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2009, I confirm the conviction ordered below but quash the irregular sentence. I proceed to sentence afresh.

10. It is significant that the accused and the girl have known each other for 
some time and wish to marry when legally able to do so. The accused is a first offender of young age, and no purpose would be served incarcerating him for this offence. The offence exists to protect young girls from predatory men with lascivious intent; but this was not the situation here. Despite the age difference it was the wish of both parties to spend the night together.

11. I take a starting point of three years imprisonment and deduct one year 
for the plea of guilty and co-operation with the Police. I add 6 months for the ""age difference"" and deduct that 6 months for his youth and clear record. The resultant sentence is one of two years.

12. The sentence of two years will be suspended for a term of two years.

13. Suspension explained.

74150,"SENTENCE

[1] The accused Simione Ratulevu Sovuna you stand convicted of the offence of Rape contrary to Sections 207(1) and 207(2)(b) of the Crimes Decree 2009.

[2] The brief facts of the case were that you were sleeping beside the victim and while she was sleeping, you hugged her and inserted your finger into her vagina. The victim was woken up by your actions and she got up and ran away to her brother's room. The victim is your niece, your cousin sister's daughter, and was 17 years old at the time of the incident.

[3] The maximum sentence for the offence of Rape is life imprisonment. Under the Penal Code Cap 17, definition of the offence of Rape was penetration of vagina with the penis without the victim's consent. Crimes Decree 2009 introduced a new definition for rape, including penetration of a thing or a part of the person's body that is not a penis into the victim's vulva, vagina or anus without the victim's consent. In this case the accused inserted his finger into the victim's vagina without her consent.

[4] The tariff for rape of a child is between 10 - 14 years imprisonment. (Mark Lawrence Mutch v. State Crim.App. No. AAU 0060 1999; Mani v. State, Crim.App.HAA 0053.02L; State v. Saitava, Crim.Case No. HAC 10/07, State v. Tony Cr. App. No. HAA 003/08). 

[5] In the case of Kasim v. State (1994) FJCA 25; AAU 0021j.93S (27 May 1994) it was decided that the starting point for sentencing an adult in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features, should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years.

[6] In Mohammed Kasim's case court said:

""While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this Court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point"".

[7] In this case the age of the victim was 17 years at the time of the incident. In terms of the Juveniles Act a child is defined as a person who has not attained the age of 14 years. Age of a juvenile in terms of the Juvenile Act as amended by Section 57 of the Prisons and Corrections Act 2006 is, 18 years.

[8] I consider that the victim in this case who was 17 years old at the time of the incident, was neither a child nor a young person but a juvenile in terms of the Juveniles Act.

[9] In case of State v. Tauvoli (2011) PJHC 216, High Court sentenced the accused who was the step father of the 13 year old victim child, to 13 years imprisonment. In case of Vasu and Anor v. State (2005) FJHC 114, the six years imprisonment sentence for rape of a 15 year old was affirmed.

[10] The aggravating factors in this case are that the victim is the niece of the accused, (Accused cousin's daughter) and he breached the trust.

[11] Mitigating factors submitted by the accused are, that he is remorseful and seeks forgiveness from court, he is married with 2 children aged 5 years and 3 years. His four sisters depend on him as his father passed away. His wife is expecting another child. He is the sole bread winner of the family. I also consider that he has no previous convictions.

[12] I take 7 years imprisonment as the starting point and add 3 years to reflect the aggravating factors. I reduce 3 years to reflect the mitigating factors above and deduct another 1 year for his previous good behavior.

[13] Therefore your final sentence is 6 years imprisonment. Acting in terms of Section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 considering the facts and circumstances of the case, and the past history of the accused I decline to fix a non-parole period.

[14] Finally the accused is sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.

70803,"SENTENCE

[1] Albertino Shankar and Francis Narayan you have been found guilty by the court of the offence of murder. The sentence fixed by law for such an offence is that the convicted person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. There is no discretion allowed to the court in a murder case to sentence to a lesser term.

[2] It is well known that convicted persons sentenced to life imprisonment usually do not serve the full term, that is serve imprisonment for the rest of their lives. Most have their sentences reduced after serving a considerable term such as 10 or 12 years.

[3] In this case I had called for submissions from counsel on whether I should recommend a minimum period to be served under the provisions of section 33 of the Penal Code. 

[4] Ms Narayan, submitting for both prisoners, informs me that the actual period of imprisonment is usually 14 years, but that the latter part is allowed to be served in the community outside of the prison walls.

[5] It is significant here that the prisoners were very young when they committed this offence. Albertino was aged 17 years 9 months. He is now 20. Francis was aged 21 at the time, and he is now 23. I keep in mind their youth.

[6] They are not from well off homes. They did not get far with their education. Albertino appears to have drifted between a home with his single mother and a home with his elderly grandfather. Francis’ home appears more stable, yet he got involved in an offence of bulk store breaking in 1999 and served a term of imprisonment of 9 months. Albertino has not previously been before the courts.

[7] Both have had casual work, but nothing of permanence or promise.

[8] Neither has shown any remorse for what they have done. Both maintain their innocence. But both were emotionally moved when asked if they had anything to say prior to sentence and in addressing the court.

[9] Mr Rabuku has made no submissions on behalf of the State on the question of whether there should be a recommendation of minimum service. Ms Narayan says the recommendation should be of 5 years only, since they have been on remand now for 2 years 3 months, equivalent to a full term of 3 years 9 months.

[10] I take that period of remand into account when arriving at the appropriate order. 

[11] This was, as I said in summing up the case, a truly dreadful crime. A 34 year old Chinese lady, a Ms Tang, living alone in a flat awakens to find two men entering through her bedroom window after midnight.

[12] According to the Accused, their plan was to steal from Ms Tang. They did eventually do just that, and this might have remained a case of house breaking. But the two Accused, commencing with Albertino, then raped Ms Tang. Francis followed after and raped her also. Each Accused raped her for a second time whilst they remained in the flat. They are not charged with rape, but I take what they said they did into account as an aggravating feature of this murder case.

[13] But to avoid any struggling and any chance of Ms Tang shouting out for help, before each raped her a second time, they taped her ankles with scotch tape or masking tape and bound up most of her face with tape, and tied her hands behind her back with wire.

[14] All of this account comes from the prisoners’ own admissions made to the police. The Accused then discussed in front of Ms Tang what they were going to do with her. Though there was some initial reluctance on the part of Francis, both agreed eventually that she would have to be killed because she would recognise them again. It is likely she knew Albertino as a person who lived downstairs at the same block of flats.

[15] Albertino brought a piece of rope from another room wound it several times around the victim’s neck, and strangled her. Francis held her legs. She struggled, until she ceased breathing and died.

[16] Just prior to the strangling, no doubt realising what the 2 Accused were deciding to do with her, Ms Tang kept pleading with them ""I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die."" It is not difficult to imagine the horrific ordeal that faced the victim in her final moments.

[17] Her life was taken with hardly a thought, ruthlessly, callously.

[18] The defence at one point appeared to hint at responsibility for the crime lying with one of Ms Tang’s friends.

[19] The inhabitants of Fiji must be made to feel secure in their homes. They should be able ""to sleep easily"", to feel secure. Housebreakers are to be deterred or at least punished. Housebreakers who go on to commit rape on the occupants, need even more severe punishment. To those who having committed those two serious crimes, go on to destroy the evidence, and to murder the occupants can expect no mercy from the courts. The courts have a duty to inflict condign punishment.

[20] But I have arrived at a recommendation for a minimum term to be served that will not destroy your lives. It will allow some hope for a fresh start when you are released. It is to be hoped that when that time comes you will indeed be able to start afresh and to make something of your lives.

[21] Accordingly you are both sentenced to life imprisonment and I recommend that you each serve a minimum term of 17 years imprisonment.

Orders accordingly.

82885,"SENTENCE

[1] This accused has been charged with the offence of manslaughter, contrary to section 198 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17. The charge reads as follows:

Statement of Offence

MANSLAUGHTER: Contrary to section 198 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

ISOA SAQANAIVALU, on the 4th day of February 2009 at Vatukoula in the Western Division unlawfully killed MERELEKI NAQURA.

[2] To this charge he pleaded guilty on the 4th October, 2010 in this Court. He agreed to a set of facts put to him in the Fijian vernacular and on the basis of his plea and his agreement to the facts, he was convicted of the offence.

Facts

[3] The facts admitted are very tragic. The deceased in this case was the 43 year old wife of the accused. On the 27th December 2008 they were both resting at home when their 10 month old baby fell whilst playing. The accused became angry at this incident thinking his wife should be in control and kicked her on the left side of her head. On the admission of the accused he kicked her head once, but she lay unconscious on the living room floor. She was taken to Tavua Hospital for examination where she was found to have ""haematoma on left brow temporal"". Over the next month she experienced severe headaches, and on the 30th January 2009 she was transferred to Suva CWM Hospital, where she was operated on after a diagnosis of left subdural haematoma. Unfortunately she failed to recover and died on the 4th February 2009. The pathologist determined the cause of death to be left side subdural haemorrhage of the brain.

[4] The accused made a frank confession to an unlawful act in an interview under caution.

The Law

[5] The Court of Appeal in Bae v State [1999] FJCA, 21, has said that sentences for manslaughter should range from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal. These dicta have been approved of and applied in subsequent cases, for example in State v Kean HAC 37 of 2007 and State v Stevens HAC 11 of 2008.

Mitigation

[6] The accused is now 46 years old and is unemployed. Until a few months ago he worked at Vatukoula gold mine. Apart from the baby whose fall sparked this incident, he has 3 other older children all of whom depend on him for their upbringing. His married sister is helping him in this regard.

[7] He is remorseful and asks for forgiveness. He tells me that he just wanted to teach her a lesson, he didn't want her to die. He submits that he needs his freedom to look after the children.

Analysis

[8] This is an obvious case of gratuitous domestic violence with absolutely no provocation whatsoever. The accused kicked his wife in the head which is the most vulnerable part of the body. He has deprived his four children of their mother and of a maternal upbringing.

[9] Cases of domestic violence are on the rise in Fiji, to the extent that legislation has recently been enacted in an attempt to address the problem. Sentences for such behaviour must reflect the Court's and the community's disapproval and must act inasmuch as it can to protect women in the family home.

[10] To reflect the violent and unprovoked act of kicking his wife in the head (later causing her death) I take as a starting point a term of ten years. For mitigation including his ""eve of trial"" plea of guilty, his time in custody, and his claimed remorse I deduct 3 years from that term meaning that he will go to prison for a term of 7 years. He will serve a minimum term of five years 6 months before being eligible for parole.

[11] He has 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

260103,"SENTENCE
___________________________________________________________________________
 
 
[1] SERUPEPELI BOLALAILAI, after being convicted on count of Sexual Assault, Rape and Attempted Rape and contrary to Sections 210(1)(a), (3)(a),207(1), (2)(b), (3) and 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, you are now brought before this Court for imposition of your sentence.
 
[2] You pleaded guilty to the charge of Sexual Assault and was duly convicted for that charge. You then pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges of Rape and Attempted Rape in the information. The ensuing trial proper lasted for four days in this Court; during which, the complainant, Noela Rakawati, Dr. Ilisapeci Vereti, and the two Police officers, who were involved with the recording your caution interview statement have given evidence for the prosecution while you also offered evidence.
 
[3] At the conclusion of trial; having reviewed the evidence and its summing up to assessors, this Court decided to accept their unanimous opinion and found you guilty and convicted you to the count of Rape and Attempted Rape.
 
[4] The following facts were proved during the trial:
 
 
 (i) The 7 year old complainant was a student at St. Vincent Primary and on 25th October 2015, you, after calling her into your room by giving her a 2 dollar coin, tried to insert your penis into her vagina and then inserted two fingers into it.
 
 (ii) When Noela came to see you, she saw you were with the complainant and she was naked from her waist. Noela then alerted her mother and upon questioning the complainant revealed what you did. The matter was then reported to Police.
 
 (iii) On the same day, the complainant was medically examined. At the time of examination, dried blood clots were noted in her groin and her left labia minor had a small abrasion.
 

[5] According to Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, the maximum punishment for Rape is imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence.
 
[6] The complainant was 7 of age at the time of the Rape and therefore, is a child. The tariff for Rape of a child is confirmed in the Judgment of Chief Justice Gates in Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12. The starting point of imprisonment for Rape of a child is 10 years. The tariff is between 10 years to 16 years.
 
[7] In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; of 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed thus:
 
""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage.""
 
[8] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, Goundar J, in Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15 has formulated the following guiding principles;
 
""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range"". 
 
[9] The sentence for Attempted Rape is 10 years of imprisonment and the tariff is set at 1 to 5 years in Aunima v State [2001] FJHC 105.
 
[10] The sentence for Sexual Assault is 10 years and its tariff is set at 2 – 8 years imprisonment as per State v Abdul Kaiyum HAC 160 of 2010, and State v. Laca [2012] FJCA 1414.
 
[11] Considering the nature of offending, and in the light of the above guiding principles, I commence your sentence at 12 years of imprisonment for the count of Rape.
 
[12] The aggravating factors are:
 
 
(i) Breach of trust the victim had towards you;
 
(ii) Opportunistic planning;
 
(iii) Taking advantage of the victim's vulnerability;
 
(iv) Display of total disregard to the victim's wellbeing;
 
(v) The 46 years of age gap between you and the complainant;
 
 
[13] I add 2 years and 8 months on your sentence for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 14 years and 8 months.
 
[14] The mitigating factors are:
 
 (i) You are a first offender;
 (ii) You co-operated with the Police during investigations. 

[15] I deduct 1 year from your sentence for Rape on the above mitigating factors. Now the sentence is 13 years and 8 months.
 
[16] You were in remand for this case for a period of 6 months and 20 days and after conviction another 17 days, pending sentencing. I consider it as a total period of 8 months. 
 
[17] In view of the provisions contained in Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I deduct your 8 month long remand period from your sentence and now the sentence to serve is 13 years.
 
[18] You pleaded guilty to the count of Sexual Assault on the first available opportunity. On that charge sentence of 6 years is initially imposed but is reduced to 4 years of imprisonment in view of early guilty plea. In considering the aggravating and mitigatory grounds a further 6 months is reduced from your sentence on this charge. Your final term of imprisonment on Sexual Assault is therefore 3 years and 6 months. 
 
[19] In relation to Attempted Rape you are sentenced to a 3 year term of imprisonment after aggravating and mitigating grounds are considered. 
 
[20] Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 10 years and 4 months of non-parole period as per the judgment of Supreme Court in Tora v The State [2015] FJSC 23.
 
 
Summary
 
[21] Your final sentence is therefore as follows:
 
 
 (i) For the count of Rape – 13 years of imprisonment with a Non-parole period fixed at 10 years and 4 months.
 (ii) For the count of Sexual Assault - 3 years and 6 months of imprisonment
 (iii) For the count of Attempted Rape - 3 years of imprisonment.

[22] The terms of imprisonments imposed in relation to charges of Sexual Assault and Attempted Rape are to run concurrently with the term of 13 years of imprisonment imposed on the charge of Rape.
 
[23] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

78873,"RULING

[1] This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence pursuant to section 21(1) (c) of the Court of Appeal Act.

[2] The appellant was convicted and sentenced to total term of 10 years' imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault and one count of rape in the High Court at Suva. The victims were three young boys aged 7, 8 and 11 years. They lived in the same neighbourhood as the appellant. The facts were that the appellant invited the victims to his house, and after committing the alleged sexual assaults, gave them a small token of money to keep them quiet. The sexual acts included kissing the victims and lying on top of them. The rape victim was the youngest. After penetrating the victim's mouth with his penis, the appellant performed oral sex on the victim.

[3] On each count of sexual assault, the learned judge imposed a sentence of 4 years' imprisonment after citing the tariff to be between 2 to 4 years' imprisonment as established by Rokota v State Criminal Appeal No. HAA0068 of 2002. The learned judge did not refer to any specific range of sentences for rape of a child, but used 12 years' imprisonment as a starting point after citing three High Court cases that were considered under the repealed Penal Code. The learned judge added two years after identifying the following aggravating factors at paragraph 27 of his sentencing remarks:

(i) Age of the victims ranging from 7 years to 11 years.

(ii) You have repeated your sexual activities on 5 children."" (I take the reference to 5 children is a typographical error as the facts adopted by the learned trial judge correctly identified 3 victims).

[4] The sentence was then reduced by four years for the following mitigating factors at paragraph 28 of the sentencing remarks:

(i) You were 29 years unmarried.

(ii) You are remorseful.

(iii) You have pleaded guilty.

(iv) Your period in remand.

(v) You were subjected to abuse when you were a small child.
[5] The learned judge then imposed a sentence of 10 years for rape and 4 years for each count of sexual assault, to be served concurrently. The total sentence was 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years.

[6] The grounds of appeal against sentence are:

(1) The learned Judge erred in fact and in law when he failed to take into account the period that the Appellant was in remand before sentence and failed to award an appropriate discount or deduction for such time already spent in remand;

(2) The learned Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a separate discount to the Appellant for his guilty plea;

(3) The learned Judge erred in law and fact when he took the starting point of 12 years for sentence as he should have started at the lower end of the scale given the circumstances of the case;

(4) The learned Judge erred in fact and law when he failed to properly take into account the mitigating factors provided by the Appellant.

[7] The test for leave to appeal against sentence is that the appellant must demonstrate the sentencing judge has arguably acted upon a wrong principle, mistook the facts, failed to take into account some relevant considerations, or took into account irrelevant matters in sentencing.

Ground 1 – Remand Period
[8] Remand period was subsumed in the deduction made for the mitigating factors. The remand period was one month. Since the length of the remand period was not substantial, no arguable error can arise from the manner in which the learned judge deducted the remand period by subsuming it under the mitigating factors. This ground is not arguable.

Ground 2 – Guilty Plea
[9] There is no hard and fast rule regarding the weight to be given to a guilty plea. Generally a generous discount is given for guilty pleas in rape cases because the victims are relieved from giving evidence in court that is of sexual nature. Timing of the guilty plea is also relevant in assessing the weight to be given to the guilty plea. Counsel for the appellant cites the case of Naikelekelevesi v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0001 of 2007 for the proposition that a guilty plea should be discounted separately from the mitigating factors. Naikelekelevesi's case was considered before the Sentencing and Penalties Decree came into effect in 2010. The Sentencing and Penalties Decree has not endorsed the Naikelekelevesi principle. Instead the Sentencing and Penalties Decree has left it to the discretion of the sentencing court to give an appropriate weight to a guilty plea when sentencing an offender. In the present case, the appellant was given a generous discount of 4 years for all the mitigating factors including his guilty pleas.

[10] A separate discount for the guilty pleas may not have resulted in the same reduction that was given for the mitigating factors. Initially the appellant pleaded guilty but then withdrew his guilty pleas. He changed his pleas to guilty only after he was found to be mentally stable at the time of the offending by a psychiatrist. In my judgment, the guilty pleas by the appellant were not evidence of contrition, but an acknowledgement of the strength of evidence against him on charges that could have attracted harsher sentences than what was imposed on him after he pleaded guilty. This ground is not arguable.

Ground 3 - Starting Point
[11] As a matter of practice, the starting point is selected from an objective seriousness of the offence or offences without consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors. There is no fixed rule regarding the selection of a starting point. The main principle is that the final sentence should reflect the criminality involved. In the present case, the learned judge used a head starting point of 12 years for both rape and sexual assaults and then made all the sentences concurrent. The effect of this approach is that the appellant received one punishment for four separate sexual offences against three victims. Ten years' imprisonment clearly reflects the criminality involved. This ground is not arguable.

Ground 4 – Co-operation with Police and previous good character
[12] Under this ground, the appellant submits that the learned High Court judge failed to take into account the appellant's co-operation with Police and previous good character. As a matter of principle, co-operation and assistance rendered by an accused to Police in the course of a criminal investigation that leads to an arrest and prosecution of other suspects attract some discount in sentence for the accused who offered the relevant information. In this case, there was no evidence that the appellant assisted Police investigation. Under caution, the appellant denied the allegations. Denial of allegations is not tantamount to co-operation. 

[13] However, the appellant was a first time offender. Counsel appearing for the appellant in the High Court informed the learned judge that the appellant was a first time offender. In sentencing the appellant, the learned judge failed to take into account that the appellant was a first time offender. Previous good character no doubt is a mitigating factor and the appellant was entitled to some reduction in sentence for that fact. This ground is arguable.

Result
[14] Leave granted on the failure of the trial judge to take into account the appellant's previous good character in sentence under ground 4. Leave refused on the remaining grounds.

	2.	You were given the opportunity as of right to apply for legal aid however you did not do so. Hence you waived your right to apply for counsel and pleaded guilty freely to the charge and also accepted the facts tendered by prosecution. 

	3.	The Court being satisfied that you pleaded guilty voluntarily convicted you as charged.

Facts

	1.	You on 8th June 2013 at Koroboya Village Vatukoula had been drinking grog with a friend when the complainant your wife (Teresia Sadole 21yrs) came over and called you. You got angry and chased the complainant. You got hold of her and hit her and struck her with a stone and barbed wire. 

The matter was reported to police and you were questioned for the offence and charged for the alleged offence.

The complainant was also taken for medical examination and her medical report shows that she had sustained injuries to her back, leg and head.

	1.	You mitigated and I consider the following in your favor:
	◦	Guilty plea.
	◦	First offender.
	◦	Sought forgiveness from the court and has also reconciled with the complainant.

Tariff

	1.	The maximum sentence for the offence you've been charged with under the Crimes Decree 2009 is 15 years imprisonment. 

	2.	Grievous Harm is a serious offence and according to State v Mokubula [2003] FJHC 164; HAA0052J.2003S the tariff is between 6 months and 5 years. If a weapon is used tariff would be between 2 years and 5 years.

	3.	In the case of Felix Patel v State Criminal Appeal No. HAA 30 of 2011, Justice Madigan when considering an appeal on sentence for the offence of Grievous Harm under section 258 of the Crimes Decree, upheld a 30 month's imprisonment term for the appellant who had pleaded guilty to attacking his own brother and smashed a beer bottle onto his head, causing serious injuries. 

	4.	The following I would consider as aggravating:
	◦	Breach of trust due to the existing relationship.
	◦	Lack of provocation from the complainant.

Sentence

	1.	In light of your relationship with the complainant, the offending in this case is regarded as a domestic violence offence and it is not a reconcilable offence. 

	2.	In considering the offending in this case, I take a starting point of 24 months. For the aggravating factors, I increase your sentence by 2 months. Therefore your sentence stands at 26 months imprisonment.

	4.	I now consider whether your sentence should be suspended. You've a first offender and sorry for your actions. However the offence you committed is serious and could have been fatal as the complainant was injured on a vulnerable body part which is the head. In the opinion of the court a strong deterrence is warranted in the public interest. People must learn to resolve their disputes or differences through dialogue and peaceful means and not through the use of violence. In addition there are no exceptional circumstances that would warrant suspending your sentence.

	5.	Your sentence will not be suspended. You will serve an immediate imprisonment term of 12 months.

278015,"JUDGMENT
(Sentences for domestic violence wounding)
 
 
  
• On the 9th June 2014 in the Magistrates Court at Nasinu, the appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of unlawful wounding contrary to section 261 of the Crimes Decree 2009. She was sentenced by the Resident Magistrate on the 4th July 2014 to a term of imprisonment of 18 months and a domestic violence restraining order was issued against her in favour of her husband as the protected person.
 
 
• The facts upon which she was convicted were that the appellant lived with the complainant who is a Police Officer and they had two young children. 
 
 
• On the 23rd March 2014 while both were watching TV, an argument arose as to where the husband had spent the previous Friday night away from home. The argument became heated until this appellant threw a kitchen knife at her husband's stomach. In an attempt to ward off the knife his middle right finger was wounded resulting in profuse bleeding.
 
 
• On agreement to these facts, the appellant (as accused at trial) was convicted.
 
 
• In his sentence, the learned Magistrate found that the aggravating features of the crime were:
  
• (1) minimal provocation.
 
• (2) degree of violence high.
 
• (3) use of knife to inflict injury.
 
• (4) abuse of trust.
 
• (5) intention to commit more serious injury.
 
• (6) attack to stomach – very vulnerable.
 


And the mitigating features he found to be:
 
  
• plea of guilty
 
• remorse
 
• apologized to Court
 
• co-operation with the Police
 
• first offender
 
• reconciliation
 
• no premeditation
 
• personal circumstances – mother of two young children
 
 
• The maximum sentence for this offence is 5 years imprisonment. There are as yet no guidelines set but in Suresh Nand Maharaj HAA 48 of 2010, Goundar J upheld an 18 month sentence for a similar offence.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate took 24 months' imprisonment as a starting point; he added 10 months for the aggravating factors and reduced it by 6 months for the mitigating factors and by a further 10 months for a plea of guilty and the ""reconciliation""; resulting in a final sentence of 18 months imprisonment. The Magistrate spent much research and time in reviewing authorities to decide whether to suspend the sentence or not. He decided after much deliberation not to suspend the sentence because it was gratuitous and unnecessary violence in a domestic violence context.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 24 of the Domestic Violence Decree the Magistrate made the compulsory domestic violence restraining order to protect the safety of her husband.
 

This appeal
 
  
• The appellant by his counsel submits that she was penalized twice by the Magistrate who had found that the degree of violence was high and that a wound resulted but then went on to find the high violence to be an aggravating factor.
 
 
• As a second ground she submits that her crime was of a lesser nature than that penalized in the case of Suresh Nand Maharaj v. State HAA 48/1010 where a sentence of 18 months was approved. She says her lesser crime should have attracted a lesser sentence.
 
 
• As a third ground the appellant relies on cases of act with intent to cause serious bodily harm which is a more serious crime and where lesser sentences have been imposed. In particular she relies on John Trail HAC 181/11 where the accused was sentenced to one year suspended for two years for act to cause grievous bodily harm. It was a case of punching and hitting the victim with a piece of timber bringing blood to the head, and causing fracture to the base of the skull.
 
 
• The appellant's last ground is that the sentence is severe given that no disability nor permanent injury resulted.
 
 
• The appellant's counsel is correct in saying that there has not been a tariff set for this offence but it was said by this Court in Kolinio Sikitora HAC 67/2010Ltk that a tariff of 9-12 months imprisonment would be appropriate for the offence given that that was the Penal Code tariff and the maximum penalty has not charged. However, as was said in that case and it is repeated now that sentences for wounding in domestic violence cases must attract higher sentences because of the breach of trust. Sentences for this offence when the wounding is serious could extend up to 3 years in domestic violence cases. The starting point taken will depend on the injury inflicted.
 
 
• Making reference to other cases decided with lesser sentences entered is not very helpful. Each case must turn on its own particular facts and the view of the Judge of those facts at the time. It is even worse to compare sentences for different crimes as Mr. Waqainabete would have me do.
 
 
• I now state that the tariff for wounding (s.261) are sentences of imprisonment between 9 and 12 months, but wounding in domestic violence cases creates a tariff of 12 months to 3 years depending on the following factors:
  
• the seriousness of the wound.
 
• degree of provocation.
 
• remorse
 
• dangerousness weapon used.
 

 
• As in all domestic violence cases, reconciliation is to be viewed with scepticism. The aggrieved partner will invariably say that he or she has forgiven the perpetrator and they have reconciled because he/she wants the previous status quo to be restored where they each received benefit from each other. A plea of reconciliation can be mitigatory if there is evidence before the Court of genuine reconciliation.
 
 
• In domestic violence cases, the presumption in favour of bail disappears. And so should the possibility of suspension of sentences. A domestic violence offence destroys the fabric of family life and it is a gross breach of trust: for those reasons it can only be in the most exceptional cases that a sentence of imprisonment for domestic violence wounding would be suspended.
 
 
• I agree with the appellant that the Magistrate has seemingly punished her twice by taking a high starting point. By starting at 24 months and saying as he did: ""This high starting point subsumes the serious domestic violence attack"" he should not then go on to add time for ""degree of violence being high"" and ""aiming for a vulnerable area of the body"". He was correct in finding that the breach of trust and minimal provocation were valid aggravating factors.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 256 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009, I set aside the sentence passed below and proceed to sentence the appellant afresh.
 
 
• I adopt the same starting point of 24 months which is appropriate for the unprovoked violence perpetrated by the appellant on her husband. I add to that 6 months for the aggravating features of breach of trust, minimal provocation and the use of a knife, a dangerous weapon. From the interim total of 30 months imprisonment I deduct 9 months for the appellant's strong mitigating features of being a first offender, of being relatively young with two small children to be concerned for, for the lack of pre meditation and her obvious remorse. The interim term being now 21 months I deduct a full third for her early plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities.
 
 
• The sentence that the accused will serve will be one of 14 months imprisonment. For the reasons given earlier it will not be suspended. I decline to order a minimum term that she should serve. This sentence is to start on the date of sentence in the Magistrates Court which is the 4th July 2014.
 
 
• The Domestic Violence restraining order issued by the Magistrate is to remain in force until further order.
 
 
• The appeal succeeds to that extent.

• You, Sireli Kaci stands convicted for one count of rape contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
 
 
• Subsequent to the hearing of this charge and the unanimous guilty verdict of the three assessors, the court found you guilty and convicted for this offence of rape. 
 
 
• It was proved at the conclusion of the hearing that you waited for the victim which whom you had an extra marital relationship, at the Lautoka Club, when she was going home after work around 10 p.m. on the 2nd of November 2012. You were drunk and wanted to talk to her. She refused to talk with you. You then pulled her down and assaulted her. You then took a broken bottle of beer and threatened her with it. Thereafter, you removed her clothes and has had sexual intercourse with her. Subsequently, you took the complainant in the taxi and dropped her few meters away from her home. 
 
 
• This is a case of an acquaintance rape, which is commonly known as ""date rape"". It is a form of sexual coercion where a known person, a romantic or sexual partner, forcefully have sexual intercourse with the victim. This is indeed one of the worse forms of sexual offences, which infringes the victim's life, physically and emotionally.
 
 
• Having considered the section 4 (1) of the sentencing and penalties decree, I find that the main purpose of this sentencing must be founded on the principle of deterrence. It is a responsibility of the court, to demonstrate the grave seriousness of the offences of this nature to the public in sentencing. I am mindful of the principle of rehabilitation; however, the court must give priority to deter the offenders and other persons from committing offences of this nature, while preserving the principle of rehabilitation. 
 

6. Tariff for the offence of rape ranges from 7 years to 15 years (State v Marawa[2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004), The State v Navauniani Koroi (unreported) Cr. App Case No. HAA0050.2002S, The State v Samu Seru (unreported) Suva Crim. Case No. HAC0021.2002S, State v Oteti Sivonatoto, Crim Case No 207 of 2011) 
 
 
7. Having considered the nature of this offending and the seriousness surrounded with it, I select 7 years as the starting point. 
 
 
8. You forcefully pushed her down and assaulted her, when she refused to talk to you. You then threatened her with a broken beer bottle before you commit this crime on her. You breached and abused the trust that the victim had for you as her boyfriend. I consider these reasons as aggravating factors of this offence. 
 
 
9. I now turn to consider mitigating factors for you. You have no previous convictions. The learned counsel of the defence submitted that you are 49 years old and have seven children. The counsel further submitted that you are the sole breadwinner.
 
 
10. Having considered the above mentioned aggravating factors, I increase 1 years to reach 8 years of interim imprisonment period. In considering the mitigating factors which I discussed above, I reduce 1 year to reach the final sentence of 7 years for the offence of rape. 
 
 
11. Accordingly, Mr. Sireli Kaci, I sentence you seven (7) years of imprisonment period for the offence of rape contrary to section 207(1) and 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree. In pursuant of section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, you are not eligible for parole for a period of 5 years.

81171,"SENTENCE

[1] The Accused stands convicted of one count of rape. Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children. Children are our future. The courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.

[2] In this case, the circumstances of the offending are serious. The victim was 4 years old when she was raped. The Accused was 34 years old and was in a position of trust. He was the victim’s neighbour and the victim called him grandfather. The victim was lured into the Accused’s house when she was playing outside and raped. Medical examination revealed abrasions and tenderness around the victim’s vagina. Her hymen was not intact.

[3] In mitigation, the Accused said he is 34 years old and is unemployed. He is in a de facto relationship. He has attained up to primary education. The Accused has 5 brothers and 2 sisters. His partner is depended on him. The Accused has no criminal history. He has been in remand since 27 August 2008 awaiting sentence. Although the Accused has exercised his right to a trial, I see from the court record that he only asked the complainant one question in cross examination.

[5] The prosecution has tendered a victim impact statement. The author of the report is the complainant’s grandmother. The Accused objects to the report on the ground that the report contains expert opinion evidence and that the author is not qualified to express such opinion. I agree and disregard the report from my consideration of the sentence.

[6] The only mitigating factor is the Accused’s previous good character. I give no weight to the fact that he is the sole bread winner in his family because when he committed the offence he was unemployed. 

[7] The aggravating features in this case are the tender age of the victim, the age gap between the victim and the Accused, and the breach of trust by the Accused.

[8] The tariff for rape of a child is between 10 to 14 years imprisonment (Mutch v State, Cr. App. AAU0060/99, Mani v State, Cr. App. No. HAA0053/02L, State v Saitava, Cr. Case No. HAC10/07, State v Marawa, Cr. Case No. 016/03, Drotini v State, Cr. App. AAU001/05 and State v Tony, Cr. App. No. HAA003/08).

[9] Since this is a case of a single count of rape, I use 10 years as my starting point. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors and reduce 2 years for the mitigating factor and the time spent in remand.

[10] The Accused is sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. The Accused is advised he has a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal within 30 days.

80154,"DECISION

At the end of the hearing of this appeal on 25th March 2002 the appeal was allowed and the appellant was ordered to be immediately released. On that occasion I indicated that I would provide reasons in due course which I now do.

The appellant was convicted by the Labasa Magistrates Court after he pleased guilty to an offence of Attempted Rape and admitted the facts outlined by the prosecutor which told of how the appellant had accosted the complainant when she was returning home from school and had pulled her to the roadside and had forcibly kissed her and restrained her despite her protestations until the complainant managed to free herself by biting him on the left arm.

In mitigation the appellant indicated that he and his parents had traditionally reconciled with the complainant and her family after the event.

The trial magistrate in sentencing the appellant to 18 months imprisonment said : 

`Reconciliation will only mitigate on the sentence as the offence is not reconcilable. Accused had committed this offence on a student and her experience is likely to be with her for life.’

The appellant through his counsel appealed against the sentence on several grounds including that it was `harsh and excessive taking into account the circumstances’ and the trial magistrate had `failed to consider relevant mitigation factors.’ 

Counsel for the appellant in arguing the appeal highlighted the relative youth of the appellant (Date of Birth : 25.3.83) at the time of the incident and the fact that he was a first offender that had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

Counsel indicated that these mitigating factors were not taken into account by the trial magistrate. Certainly they were not mentioned in the sentencing remarks and further the trial magistrate does not appear to have considered a non-immediately custodial alternative or requested a welfare officer’s report as he should have done.

Counsel also submitted that the facts outlined and admitted by the appellant did not support the charge and at most amounted to an indecent assault for which the appellant came off the worst.

State Counsel whilst seeking to support the sentence conceded that the facts did not support the charge of attempted rape in the absence of any unequivocal proximate overt act sufficient to sustain the charge such as the appellant being naked at the time or evidence of a serious attempt to undress the complainant.

I was satisfied that this latter concession was well made and that the trial magistrate in imposing sentence had erred in not considering and properly accounting for the several mitigating facts urged by counsel for the appellant which were also well-taken.

For the foregoing reasons, the appeal was allowed and mindful that the appellant had almost served out his entire sentence, his immediate release was ordered.

76921,"SENTENCE

1. On the 3rd August 2012 this accused entered a plea of guilty to the following charge:

Statement of Offence

ASSAULT CAUSING ACTUAL BODILY HARM: Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

SAT NARAYAN PAL on the 9th day of July 2011 at Nabua in the Central Division assaulted one ARUNA NARAYAN thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to the said ARUNA NARAYAN.

He admitted a set of facts put to him and he was as a result found guilty and convicted of the charge.

2. The facts the accused admitted were as follows:

""(i) On the evening of the 9th of July 2011, ARUNA NARAYAN (hereinafter the ""complainant"" was at home with her husband, SAT NARAYAN PAL [hereinafter the ""accused""] At about 8.30 pm the accused was drinking alone at home whilst the complainant was watching television in her room.

(ii) At about 9.30 pm the accused person came into her room and began swearing at her before he began assaulting her. The accused person then went to the kitchen and brought a small kitchen knife and put it against her neck. By doing this the complainant received a cut on the right side of her neck.

(iii) The complainant began calling out to her neighbor to help her. It was then that the accused left the complainant alone.

(iv) The neighbor of the complainant, Jitendra Chandra (hereinafter the ""neighbor""] upon hearing her cries called the Nabua Police Station for assistance. When the police finally arrived, the neighbor directed them to the home of the complainant and the accused.

(v) PC 4150 Firashad then knocked on the door of the home of the complainant and the accused person. Upon the enquiry of assault by PC 4150 Firashad, the accused person came to the door and stated that there was no assault. The accused was then asked to call the complainant who was crying at the time. Both the complainant and the accused were then taken to the Nabua Police Station.

(vi) The complainant was then taken to Raiwaqa Health Station for medical examination which the Doctor noted bruising on the right side of the face, left upper back/shoulder and upper chest wall with superficial abrasion and a cut on the left side of the neck.

(vii) The accused was then interviewed under police caution where he did not admit to the offence. He was charged with Act with intent to cause Grievous Harm, which has now been reduced to a charge of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm"".

3. The accused by his counsel has filed detailed and persuasive submissions in mitigation. He is 63 years old and has been married to the victim for 42 years. He worked all his life as a Civil Servant before retiring in 2002. He has never been before the Courts before. His wife has written what appears to be a very genuine letter of forgiveness and reconciliation to the court, speaking of their shame and disgrace as a result of this incident.

4. This is obviously an offence of domestic violence. In such an offence reconciliation as a mitigating factor is to be looked at with a high degree of skepticism. The accused's wife's letter however appears to rebut that need for suspicion.

5. The accused has diabetes and hypertension as well as recovering from heart surgery in India last year. He needs urgent medical attention and has special dietary requirements.

6. The maximum penalty for this offence is five years imprisonment and the tariff was set by Madam Justice Shameem in the case of Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78 where she said:

""The tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months' imprisonment ....That it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence"".

7. Of course in cases of domestic violence, the tariff will be enhanced in keeping with the stated aims of the Domestic Violence Decree.

8. I am persuaded however that this case stands apart from the normal domestic violence cases seen in this Court. The couple are aged, they have lived together harmoniously for 42 years; the accused has a clear record and has serious health problems. Much to his credit he has pleaded guilty. He has shown remorse throughout these proceedings.

9. The medical examination of the wife victim on the day of the assault found an abrasion and a cut on the left side of the neck with bruising around the neck and shoulders.

10. An assault of this kind with a cut from a knife would almost invariably attract a custodial sentence it being a bad assault in a domestic violence context. However given the extraordinary circumstances of this case as outlined in paragraph 8, this Court will extend mercy to the accused.

11. The accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight months to be suspended for a period of two years.

12. Suspension explained.

250772,"SENTENCE
  
•  On the 27thday of May 2016, all five accused were convicted after trial in this Court of raping an 18 year old girl in the Nacara Settlement in Ra. 1staccused,in addition to the 1st Count was convicted of a further four counts of rape as a secondary principal participant.
 
 
• The facts of the case were that on the 22nd January 2013, victim visited her aunt in the Nacara Settlement in Ra and stayed there. When aunt left home, aunt’s son, the 3rd accused, invited her to join a grog session that was in progress in the evening with the participation of other four accused. She accepted the invitation of her cousin and joined the grog session. The victim was drinking till late night and went to lie down in the upper part of the house. Whilst she was lying down, 1st accused came to her and sat on her legs. Then he held on to her and tied her hands and legs. He called the other accused. 1st accused undressed her and penetrated her vagina first. Then all the accused followed the suite and penetrated her, taking turns. 1st accused admitted the sexual intercourse in Court. At the caution interview, 3rd, 4th and 5th accused also confessed to police. 
 
 
• The tariff for rape in Fiji is well settled. When the victim is an adult as in this case, a minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment should be imposed. In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, Fiji Court of Appeal observed:
 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
  
• The victim faced a gang rape attack. Justice Madigan in State v Nairogorogo [2015] FJHC 687; HAC14.2013 (25 September 2015) has set out the tariff for gang rape between 9-15 years imprisonment and said:

“The assault on this woman was a nasty violent group attack and as such must attract penalties over and above the usual penalty for rape. An enhanced starting point will be taken for the fact that it was a group or ""gang"" rape.
 
 Whilst the normal range of sentences for rape is 7 to 15 years (Kasim), the range for a gang rape, where all perpetrators are acting in agreement, should be increased by making the lower starting point of the range to be a term of nine years. Any additional aggravating factors particular to the case being sentenced will of course be added to that point”.
  
• Rape is a serious offence committed against humanity and a violation of sexual autonomy of a person. This offence must be deterred and condemned as a social menace. Much has been said recently by the Courts as to the gravity of rape as a crime. 
 
 
• These young men all in their 20s embarked on agrogsession leading to this heinous assault on a vulnerable young girl.
 
 
• The victim was an 18 year old at the time of the offence. Her enjoyment of life that has been shattered. Scar will be with her for the rest of her life.It has been repeatedly said by psychologists that the effect of sexual assault on victims is profound and prolonged. 
 
 
• Having considered the gravity of the offending, the gang rape situation, and the impact of the victim I select a starting point of ten years’ imprisonment for all the accused.
 
 
• It is a highly aggravating feature that the accused took advantage of a vulnerable girl and exploited her when she was helpless. A girl is entitled to drink with boys and is entitled to the same respect that any drinking young man would extend to any male companion. Further, victim joined the grog session on the insistence of the 3rd accused who is her cousin. 3rd accused breached that trust. She was forced to submit to the first offender by means of physical violence.
 
 
• All five accused have clear records and are first offenders. They deserve some leniency on that account.
 
 
• All the accused surrendered to court and cooperated with police. All of them admitted the crime to police except the 2nd accused. 
 
 
• The first accused is now 25 years old and is married without children. He asks for forgiveness and expresses remorse. He had been in remand for nearly five months.
 
 
• The second accused is now 25 years old and married. He is supporting his family earning $ 200 per week. He makes an apology to the Court and asks for leniency. He had been in remand for nearly six months.
 
 
• The third accused is 20 years old. He is a farmer and works to support his family.
 
 
• The fourth accused is 21 years old. He is a farmer. He looks after three siblings since the death of his father. He asks for leniency and forgiveness.
 
 
• Fifth accused is 22 years old. He is also a farmer. He lives with father and looks after him.
 
 
• For all of these accused I take the lower starting point for gang rape at ten years’ imprisonment. From there I consider the case of each accused in turn.

Sentence for the First Accused
  
• The first accused appears to have been the instigator and leader of this gang rape. He took the lead and facilitated others to commit the offence by holding the victim’s hands and shutting her mouth. He is charged as the secondary principal participant on 2nd to 5th counts.
 
 
• From the starting point of 10 years I add 2 years for the violence he used and for his role as the facilitator. From that total of 12 years I deduct a period of 1 year for his previous good character and for other mitigating factors.For the time he spent in remand I deduct further five months. Now his final sentence for the first count is 10 years and 7 months’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• For 2nd to 5th counts, I impose a sentence of nine years’ imprisonment for each count. Having considered ‘one transaction’ and ‘totality’ principles, I order that the sentences imposed on the 2nd to 5th counts to be served concurrent to the sentence imposed on the 1st count. Having considered the fact that he is a first offender and his potential to rehabilitate I impose anon parole period of eight years. 

Sentence for TheSecond Accused
  
• I find no aggravating factor for him. From the starting point of 10 years, I deduct 1 year for his previous good character and for other mitigating factors. For the time he spent in remand, I deduct 6 months. Now his final sentence is 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. Having considered the fact that he is a first offender and his potential to rehabilitate, I impose a non parole period of six years. 

Sentence for TheThird Accused
  
• He is the one who insisted the victim to join the grog session that ended up bringing this agony to the victim who is also his cousin. From the starting point of 10 years I add 3 months for his breach of trust as the cousin of the victim. I deduct one year for his previous good character and other mitigating factors. For the time he spent in remand I deduct 6 months. Now his final sentence is 8 years and 9 months’ imprisonment. Having considered the fact that he is a first offender and his potential to rehabilitate I impose a non parole period of six years. 

Sentence for The Fourth Accused
  
• I find no aggravating factor for him. From the starting point of 10 years, I deduct 1 year for his previous good character and forothermitigating factors. For the time he spent in remand, I deduct 6 months. Now his final sentence is 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. Having considered the fact that he is a young first offender and his potential to rehabilitate, I impose a non-parole period of six years. 

Sentence for The Fifth Accused
  
• From the starting point of 10 years I add nothing for aggravation of the offence. I deduct 1 year for his previous good character and for other mitigating factors. For the time he spent in remand, I deduct 6 months. Now his final sentence is 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. Having considered the fact that he is a first offender and his potential to rehabilitate, I impose a non-parole period of six years. 
 
 
• That is the sentence imposed by this Court.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

76838,"RULING

	1.	The 1st Appellant was charged with One Count of Rape contrary to section 207(1)(3) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009 and the 2nd Appellant was charged with two counts of rape contrary to section 207(1)(3) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.

	2.	The Appellants pleaded guilty before the Magistrate's Court of Labasa and the Magistrate transferred the case to the High Court for sentencing.

	3.	Before the High Court a fresh plea was taken and the Appellants pleaded guilty to the charges and the 1st Appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and the 2nd Appellant was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment.

	4.	The Appellants have sought leave to appeal against their conviction and sentence on the following grounds:
		(a) That the guilty plea was unequivocal because of the Legal Aid Commission Lawyer's advice that they need to plead guilty and receive 2-3years sentence from the court or face the maximum sentence;

		(b) That the girl victim they are alleged to have raped had been previously involved in random sexual intercourse from an early age and before she approached them she was casually involved in sexual activities and therefore the trial Magistrate/Judge was wrong in law when they were convicted on their own plea of guilty and ordering severe sentences. 

		(c) That from the victim's physical feature they had wrongly assumed that she was of the age of consent and the Magistrate/Judge was wrong in law when he failed to judicially investigate the assumption they had made as it was only human error.

		(d) That the summary of facts presented in court did not contain evidence in support of the offence charged;

		(e) That there has been a great miscarriage of justice that has been occasioned.

		(f) That the sentence ordered by the High Court is too harsh.

	5.	The Appellants were not represented when they appeared before the Magistrate's Court and have stated that they were advised by a Legal Aid Commission's Lawyer to plead guilty. They were however not sentenced by the Magistrate and were referred to the High Court. In the High Court they were represented and a fresh plea had been taken and they had pleaded guilty and admitted the facts as presented by the prosecution. 

	6.	In the above circumstances their ground of appeal that their plea of guilt was unequivocal is not of much substance as they were represented by Counsel in the High Court who would have advised them. The first ground of appeal has no merit.

	7.	The second ground of appeal is on the basis that the victim had sexual experience previously. The victim was 12 years and 8 months old and hence under 13 years of age. According to section 207(3) of the Crimes Decree a child under the age of 13 is incapable of giving consent. Therefore the fact that the victim had consented and had previous sexual experience as asserted by the Appellants does not enure to their benefit. Therefore the second ground lacks merit.

	8.	Ground (c) is to the effect that the girls physique made them assume that she was of a consenting age. The girl was under 13 years and according to section 224 of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009 it is immaterial in the case of any of the offences committed with respect to a person under a specified age that the accused person did not know that the person was under that age, or believed she was not under that age. Therefore their belief that the girl was over 13 years was immaterial. This ground too lacks merit.

	9.	The next ground urged as ground (d) is that the summary of facts presented in court did not contain evidence in support of the offence charge. The charge that was made out against the Appellants set out the facts of the offence clearly and further it appears from the record that the Appellants had admitted the facts which has been recorded by the learned trial judge before convicting the Appellants. It is the record of the court that can be relied upon regarding the proceedings that took place in court and not any other assertions made by the Appellants. This ground too therefore lacks merit.

	10.	The next ground of appeal (e) is that the sentences imposed on the Appellant were too harsh. When imposing the sentences on the two Appellants, each Appellant's position was considered separately by the learned trial judge. As regards the 1st Appellant the learned trial judge commenced the sentencing after considering the tariff for such offences which was considered as being 11 to 16 years. The commencing point of 12 years was at the lower end of the scale and considering the victim's age as an aggravating factor increased the sentence by 2 years and taking into account the mitigating factors reduced 4 years and arrived at the sentence of 10 years. 

	11.	As regards the 2nd Appellant, the starting point was taken as 12 years and considering the victim's age, the fact that the victim was a niece of the Appellant and that he had raped the victim on more than one occasion increased the sentence by 2 years, reduced 3 years for the mitigating factors and arrived at the sentence of 11 years imprisonment. 

	12.	The manner in which the learned trial judge had sentenced the Appellants cannot be faulted in the above circumstances and therefore the ground of appeal against sentence has no merit.

	13.	Therefore the applications of the Appellants for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence are refused.

Order of Court 
Applications for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence are refused.

262822,"JUDGMENT
 
 
1. On the 26th November 2014, the respondent was sentenced in the Magistrates Court at Suva to one count of ""assault causing actual bodily harm"" contrary to s.275 of the Crimes Decree 2009. He had earlier entered a plea of guilty to the charge and admitted a set of relevant facts.
 
 
 The facts admitted were:
 
 
 ""On the 14th June 2014 at Nanuku Settlement a fight broke out between the accused and his wife. The accused tried to choke her but she threw a bucket at him at which he slapped her and punched her several times on the face and head. The wife left and went to spend the night at the accused's parents house. The next day the accused went to his parents' house and called for her. She said she had not heard him calling and so she didn't go out to see him. In a rage, the accused went in and started to beat her, punching her in the face. Medical evidence stated that she suffered swelling on both sides of the face and forehead and had cut lips"".
 
 
2. The accused in mitigation said that he had no previous record, that he had co-operated with the police and had entered a plea of guilty at first opportunity. He said he was very angry and that he could not stop himself as she had not come to him when he called her.
 
 
3. In his sentence, the learned Magistrate noted society's abhorrence of violence against women and noted also that this particular accused appeared to have no remorse whatsoever and even told the Court that he saw nothing wrong with what he did.
 
  
• The Magistrate then went on to sentence him to 12 months' imprisonment, the first two months to be served and the balance suspended.
 
 
• This Court has called for the file to review that sentence pursuant to section 260 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009. Such a process is in place to check the propriety of the sentence passed and the appropriateness of the proceedings below.
 
 
• There have been many hearings of this matter because of the difficulty in locating the respondent who once released from custody has left his wife and his whereabouts unknown. The respondent has still not been located and hasn't had the opportunity of being heard on this review. Section 262 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree would prevent this Court from acting to the prejudice of the respondent without hearing from him or his counsel. For that reason alone, the lenient sentence passed below will not be disturbed.
 
 
• It is an alarming trend noted in Fiji that more and more cases of spousal assault are coming before the Courts and clear parameters must be set to try and deter would be aggressors in the matrimonial home.
 
 
• The maximum penalty for assault causing actual bodily harm is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff was set by Goundar J in JonetaniSereka HAA 27/2008 (25 April 2008) where he held that the tariff ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a high degree of provocation to 9 months imprisonment for serious assaults that cause harm. That tariff was set for the offence under the Penal Code where the maximum penalty was the same.
 
 
• That tariff (suspended to 9 months) is still appropriate except as to say that in a domestic violence context the sentence can rise above the 9 months mark to allow for breach of trust and a consideration of the factors which must be considered as set out in section 4 (3) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree 2009.
 

10. The sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate although lenient is not wrong in law or principle and will not be disturbed.
 
  
• It is to be noted however that sentences for assaults occasioning harm in domestic violence cases will very rarely result in suspended sentences, because of the breach of trust and to send the perpetrator back into the family home is probably courting disaster without a ""cooling off"" period.

SundarKaurandGeeta Devi on the 1st of November 2015 at Sigatoka in the Western Division murdered Sanjani Lata.
 
  
•  You were explained the consequence of the guilty plea. Your Counsel confirmed that you understood the consequence and that you tendered your plea on your own free will. The Court accepted your plea after being satisfied that it was unequivocal, voluntary and free from any influence. 
 
 
• On the 23rd March 2016, amended summary of facts filed by the State was read over to you. You agreed the facts filed by the State. Court found that all the elements of offence of Murder were proved on the facts agreed by you. Youwere convicted of the charge of Murder accordingly. You now come before this Court for sentence on the conviction.
 
• On 14th April 2016, following summary of facts was read in court:

The accused is the biological mother of the deceased.
 
 
The deceased lived with the accused and her siblings in two bedroomed house at Kulukulu in Sigatoka.
 
 
On Sunday the 1st of November 2015 sometime in the morning the accused and the deceased were in one of the bedrooms at their home in Kulukulu. The accused in an attempt to discipline the deceased had bound the deceased’s hands with a blue cloth which was tied to a wooden rafter attached to the tin roof above the bed.
 
 
In order to prevent the deceased from kicking her, the accused also bound the deceased’s legs with a rope and tied the rope to the edge of the bed.
 
 
The deceased was crying out loudly.
 
 
The accused then repeatedly struck the deceased on the lower half of her body with an aluminium pipe which was used as a mop stick.
 
 
The deceased continued crying and despite that, the accused continued beating her. The accused whilst beating the deceased with the aluminium pipe knew that there was a risk that such action would cause the deceased’s death but continued to do so anyway.
 
 
The accused whilst striking the deceased after sometime noticed that the deceased’s legs were bent and she appeared to be ‘hanging’. With the assistance of her accomplice, the blue cloth which was attached to the rafter was cut, and the rope around the deceased’s legs removed. As this was done the deceased fell and the accused tried to hold her up.
 
 
The deceased was then carried by the accused’s accomplice to the bathroom where they tried to make the deceased drink water. The deceased was motionless. At this point in time it was found that the deceased was not breathing. It was the beating inflicted by the accused that caused the deceased’s death.
 
 
The deceased was then taken outside where the accused tried to resuscitate her by blowing into her mouth.
 
 
The accused then instructed her accomplice to bring an old tyre which would be used to burn the deceased’s body along with firewood and coconut shells which was in a heap at the back of their home.
 
 
The accused with the assistance of her accomplice then wrapped the deceased’s body in a thin sponge comforter and placed it in the heap.
 
 
The accused then set fire to the tyre and the thin sponge comforter with the deceased’s body in it.
 
 
After the fire had subsided, the deceased’s remains were collected and placed in the septic tank behind their home.
 
 
Police got information about the incident and investigated.
 
 
The accused was taken into custody and interviewed under caution. She was then charged with one count of Murder.
 
 
On the 5th of February 2016, the accused whilst being represented by Counsel from the Legal Aid Commission voluntarily pleaded guilty to the said charge
 
  
•  The offence of ""murder"" is the most heinous crime known to the penal law. Lawmakers had prescribed a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment for those found guilty of Murder. The court is empowered ""to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon may be considered"". 
 
 
•  I considered the manner and the circumstances under which you committed this offence on your own daughter. I also considered the sentencing submissions filed by the State and your Counsel.
 
 
•  You subjected your daughter to prolonged brutality and suffering. Her leg and hands were tied to restrict her movements. You repeatedly struck her with an aluminum pipe while she was crying. 
 
 
•  You breached the trust as a mother and betrayed the motherhood. This offence is no doubt violated Domestic Violence Decree.
 
 
•  Your daughter was only 14 years. She was utterly helpless and you exploited her vulnerability. 
 
 
• You took every effort to conceal the brutal crime with the assistance of your daughter- in- law. 
 
 
• Your Counsel has filedsubmission in mitigation. You are 45 years old and handicapped with one leg. 
 
 
• You do not have any record of previous convictions. Your previous good character will be considered when setting the minimum term of imprisonment.
 

13. You have been remorseful after the commission of this crime and seek forgiveness. 
 
  
• You pleaded guilty to the charge at the earliest available opportunity without wasting time of this Court. 

15. You have been in remanded since 19th of November 2015. 
 
  
• The Courthas no option but impose life imprisonment. I therefore sentence you to life imprisonment. Having considered the culpability of the offending, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, I fix the minimum term to be served as 14 years, before a pardon may be considered. 
 

SENTENCE FOR 2nd ACCUSED GEETA DEVI
 
  
• Ms. GEETA DEVI, you, the 2nd Accused on 5th February, 2016, in the presence of your Counsel, pleaded guilty to the count of Giving False Information to a Public Servant in the following information:
 

Statement of Offence
 
 
  GIVING FALSE INFORMATION TO A PUBLIC SERVANT: Contrary to Section 201 (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
 GEETA DEVI on the 1st of November 2015, at Sigatoka, in the Western Division, gave false information to SC NetevaRasila, a public servant, which she knew to be false.
 
  
• You were explained the consequence of the guilty plea. Your Counsel confirmed that you understood the consequence and that you tendered your plea on your own free will. The Court accepted your plea after being satisfied that it was unequivocal, voluntary and free from any influence. 
 
• On the 23rd March 2016, amended summary of facts filed by the State was read over to you. You agreed the facts filed by the State. Court found that all the elements of the offence of GIVING FALSE INFORMATION TO A PUBLIC SERVANT were proved on the facts agreed by you. You were convicted of the charge accordingly.

On the 1st of November 2015 at around 1.30 pm the accused together with Mohammed Faizal Ali went to the Kulukulu Police Post.
 
 
There she lodged a report to Special Constable NetavaRasila, a person employed in the public service by the Fiji Police Force that one Sanjini Lata of KulukuluSigatoka had gone missing from home despite knowing that the information she gave to Special Constable Rasila was not true.
 
 
On her way back from the Police Post the accused admitted to Mohammed Faizal Ali that whatever she had told Special Constable NetavaRasila was false.
 
 
Police received information about the incident and investigated.
 
 
The accused was taken into custody and interviewed under caution. She was then charged with one count of Giving False Information to a Public Servant.
 
 
On the 5th of February 2016, the accused whilst being represented by Counsel from the Legal Aid Commission voluntarily pleaded guilty to the said charge.
 
  
• The maximum penalty for the offence of Giving False Information to a Public Servant is 5 years’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• In MuskanBalaban v State Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 2011, Justice D. Gounder affirmed the starting point of 2 years and having considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, fixed the final sentence at 18 months’ imprisonment. The accused in that matter had given false information to the effect that her Counsel had raped her.
 
 
• In Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption v Padarath[2016] FJMC 31 (9 March 2016) the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 25 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 months. 
 
 
• In this case you have given false information to police that your sister- in- law had gone missing from home despite knowing that the information was not true. These typesof offences should be discouraged and the sentence must send a clear waning to the society. 
 
 
• Your Counsel has filed submission in mitigation. You are 28 years old mother with two children.
 

26. You do not have any record of previous convictions. 
 
 
27. You have been remorseful after the commission of this crime and seek forgiveness. 
 
  
• You pleaded guilty to the charge at the earliest available opportunity without wasting time of this Court. 
 

29. You have been in remanded since 19th of November 2015. 
 
  
• Having considered your mitigation submitted by your Counsel and the remand period you are sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment with a non parole period of 10 months. 
 
 
• You have committed this offence to conceal the murder of your own sister-in-law for which you are jointly charged with. In these circumstances, you deserve an immediate custodial sentence. Therefore, I do not suspend your sentence.

79976,"JUDGMENT

[1] The appellant was convicted of rape of his seven year old step daughter on his plea of guilty and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

[2] He appeals against conviction and sentence. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant abandoned the appeal against conviction and pursued the appeal against sentence alone. Since the appellant is unrepresented, I consider the appeal against conviction as well. 

[3] The appellant contends that his plea is equivocal because he was advised by police officers to plead guilty, that the learned Magistrate failed to explain the elements of the offence and that full disclosures were not served on him.

[4] Further, the appellant contends that his sentence is harsh and excessive, that the learned Magistrate failed to consider his guilty plea and that the learned Magistrate failed to indicate the basis on which the sentence was imposed.

[5] On 25 February 2008, the appellant appeared in the Magistrates’ Court and elected to be tried in that Court. The learned Magistrate advised the appellant of his right to legal representation and ordered the prosecution to provide disclosures to the legal aid counsel so that the appellant could be advised by counsel. 

[6] On 26 February 2008, the appellant informed the learned Magistrate that he had been advised by the legal aid counsel and that he had received the disclosures. The case was then adjourned to allow the legal aid to assess the appellant’s application.

[7] On 18 August 2008, counsel for the legal aid advised the court that the appellant’s application has been rejected. The appellant was arraigned on the charge and he pleaded guilty. The court record reads:

""Charge read and explained.
Election explained to accused.

Accused: Elects Magistrates’ Court Trial.
I wish to plead guilty.

Court: Are you pleading guilty of your own free will.
Facts as per summary of facts.
Facts explained to the accused.
Accused admit the facts.
Tender Caution Interview and Medical Report of complainant and birth certificate of complainant.
Accused is convicted as charged.
Previous Conviction admitted.
Previous Conviction is dated 14/10/80.
Previous Conviction is rendered irrelevant and will not be considered for these proceedings.

Mitigation

I am 48 years old. I am married with 8 children. I work for FSC in the Shipping Department. I earn sometimes $80.00 and sometimes $100.00. I reside at Navutu in Lautoka.""

[8] Before accepting the appellant’s plea of guilty, the learned Magistrate ensured that he was not prejudiced by lack of legal representation. The learned Magistrate gave ample opportunity to the appellant to engage counsel. Plea was taken after legal aid refused the appellant’s application. The charge was valid in law and the facts admitted by the appellant disclosed the charged offence.

[9] I find the learned Magistrate conducted the proceedings with utmost fairness to the appellant and there is nothing in the record to support the appellant’s contentions that his plea was equivocal and that he was prejudiced by lack of legal representation. 

[10] I reject the contention by the appellant that he pleaded guilty because he was advised by some police officers. There is nothing in the record to support the claim of the appellant. Nor is there any evidence before me of such pressure on the appellant to plead guilty by the police officers. 

[11] I am satisfied that the plea of the appellant was freely and voluntarily made and that he was properly convicted.

[12] The learned Magistrate gave careful and detail reasons for the sentence imposed on the appellant.

[13] The learned Magistrate correctly identified the starting point of 10 years imprisonment for rape of a child (Asesela Drotini v State Cr. App. No. AAU001 of 2005). The learned Magistrate said:

""The complainant in this matter was 7 years old at the time you raped her. She was at an age where all young girls need love, care, understanding, nurturing and protection. What she could not get from her biological father as a result of a broken home, she expected from you, for after all you were the provider in the family not only for her, for her other siblings and also for her mother, who was by now your wife. You however used your authority and trust not to protect her but to violate her. You made her the target of your personal desires and gratification having no regard for the physical and mental trauma you no doubt caused her. I therefore pick as my starting point the term of 10 years imprisonment.

After violating her, you then kept her under siege with your threats for almost 2 years. You had no regard for whatever emotional and psychological effect that she may have from your mere presence in the home. This is reflected clearly by the fact that only when you left home after an argument with her mother was she able to complain about your offending to her. For that I increase the term by 2 years to 12 years imprisonment.

In considering your previous good character, your family circumstances, your genuine remorse, your cooperation with the police and your guilty plea I reduce the sentence by 2 years to that of 10 years imprisonment.

There is nothing more available apart from what I have considered to mitigate this offending. You will therefore serve a term of 10 years imprisonment.""

[14] I endorse the sentencing remarks of the learned Magistrate. This was indeed a dreadful offence committed on a vulnerable child of a very tender age. The appellant grossly breached the trust placed on him by the victim and her mother. The offence was further aggravated by the threats to the victim by the appellant to prevent her from complaining. The learned Magistrate was justified to take a serious view of the offence. After discounting for the aggravating and mitigating factors, the learned Magistrate imposed a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.

[15] The sentence of 10 years imprisonment on the objective assessment of the facts in this case, is neither excessive nor wrong in principle.

[16] The appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

79283,"SENTENCE

	1.	In a judgment, delivered on 17 April 2014, the court found you guilty of raping the child complainant, on 26 May 2012, at Kadavu in the Eastern Division, contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (Count No. 1). On 14 April 2014, before the trial proper commenced, you pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the complainant, on the same day, by sucking her vagina, contrary to section 210 (1) (a) and (2) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (Count No. 2); and also by indecently assaulting her, on the same day, by fondling her breasts, contrary to section 212 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (Count No. 3). You have been convicted of all the above offences.

	2.	The brief facts were as follows. You taught at Richmond Methodist School as a music teacher. You resided in a teacher's quarters in the school compound. You were 49 years old at the time, while the complainant was 13 ½ years old. You asked the complainant's parents for the complainant to clean your house. You lived alone. At your house, you asked the complainant to massage your back. While she was massaging your back, you committed the above offences against her, without her consent and well knowing she was not consenting to the same, at the time.

	3.	""Rape"" is always a serious offence, and it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment (section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009). Society views ""rape"" as the worst form of sexual assault, and an unwanted invasion of a person's privacy and dignity, thus prescribing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The tariff for the rape of an adult is 7 to 15 years imprisonment; while the tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 16 years imprisonment: Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal.

	4.	""Sexual Assault"" carried a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. There is no established tariff, but I accept what His Lordship Justice Paul Madigan said in State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca, Criminal Case No. HAC 252 of 2011, High Court of Suva. His Lordship set the tariff between 2 to 8 years imprisonment, the higher tariff been set for serious sexual assaults.

	5.	""Indecent assault"" carried a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment, and the tariff had been set between 1 to 4 years imprisonment: Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0068 of 2002S, High Court, Suva. The final sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors. 

	6.	The aggravating factors in this case were as follows:
		(i) Breach of Trust. A teacher always stands in a fiduciary relationship with a student. In a school setting, the teacher is the student's ""mother, father, counselor and mentor"", and is there to see that the student grows into been a useful member of society. It is a sacred relationship, and should not be abused at all. In this case, by committing the offences against the child complainant, the accused had abused the trust placed on him.

		(ii) By offending against the complainant, the accused had caused injuries to her, as reported in her medical report, and caused emotional traumas as reported in her victim impact report.

		(iii) By offending against the complainant, the accused had showed utter disregard to her right as a human being, and her right to personal privacy.

	7.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) At the age of 49 years, this is the accused first sexual offences;

		(ii) He had apologized to the complainant's parents;

		(iii) He had been remanded in custody for approximately 11 months 2 weeks.

	8.	On the ""rape"" charge (count no. 1), I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the same by 4 years, to 16 years imprisonment. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 13 years imprisonment.

	9.	On the ""sexual assault"" charge (count no. 2), I start with 4 years imprisonment. I add 2 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 6 years imprisonment. I deduct 2 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 4 years imprisonment.

	10.	On the ""indecent assault"" charge (count no. 3), I sentence the accused to 2 years imprisonment.

	11.	In summary, your sentence are as follows:
		(i) Count No. 1 : Rape : 13 years imprisonment.

		(ii) Count No. 2 : Sexual Assault : 4 years imprisonment.

		(iii) Count No. 3 : Indecent Assault: 2 years imprisonment.

12. Because of the totality principle of sentencing, I direct that all the above sentences be made concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 13 years imprisonment.

13. Before I leave this case, it must be said that the teaching profession is a noble one in this country. A lot of us owe our destiny to the hard honest work that our teachers have taught us through the years. Most of them have passed on, but their values stay with us until the end. This case is designed for the few that have strayed off the course.

14. For offending against the child complainant, I sentence you, Aisake Kivi, to 13 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years, effective forthwith.

15. The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

258992,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Basnayake JA
 
 
[1] This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against the conviction and sentence of the appellant and to adduce fresh evidence. The appellant was charged in the High Court of Lautoka for indecent assault contrary to Section 154 (1) and rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (Cap 17) (pg. 105 of the Record of the High Court (RHC). After trial before three Assessors, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty on counts 1, 2 on indecent assault and 3 and 4 on rape as charged. On count five the appellant was convicted for the offence of indecent assault. The appellant was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a period of non-parole for 15 years. 
 
[2] The appellant appealed against the conviction and the sentence (pgs. 29, 33). On 16 May 2014 a motion was filed on behalf of the appellant (pg. 20) by counsel together with an affidavit of the appellant (pg. 15) to lead fresh evidence. A single Judge of the Court of Appeal having inquired into the above applications refused leave to appeal (on 24 July 2014 at pg. 3). However the learned Judge allowed the appellant to make a renewed application and to call over for listing the application for fresh evidence. On 14 April 2016 the learned counsel for the appellant filed a renewed application.
 
 
[3] In the renewed application the appellant relied on the following grounds against the conviction, namely:
  
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and denied the appellant a fair hearing, because of non-disclosure before or during trial of a letter dated 9 November 2011 purporting the allegation against the appellant to be false and fabricated.
 
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors how to approach the expert opinion evidence.
 
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up.
 

Against the sentence
 
 
[4] The following grounds were urged as against the sentence, namely:
  
• That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to separately discount the 9 months the appellant had spent in remand. 
•  That the learned trial Judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature.


C. That the sentence was in breach of section 14 (2) (n) of the Constitution of the 
 
Republic of Fiji Islands.
 
 
To lead fresh evidence 
 
 
[5] “In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial” (Lord Denning in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 754). This is one of the well established principles of law to qualify the allowance of fresh evidence. At the outset of the submissions, counsel for the appellant withdrew the application to lead fresh evidence for the reason that the appellant was aware of the document well before the commencement of the trial that he intended to lead in fresh evidence. Ground A on the convictions too was withdrawn for the reason that this question is based on the document intended to be led in fresh evidence. The learned counsel for the appellant confined his appeal to grounds B & C on the conviction and grounds A, B & C on the sentence. 
 
 
Evidence 
 
 
[6] The prosecution case consists of evidence of the victim (pgs. 129-40), Dr. Hanif (141-2), Ms. Malimali, grandmother of the victim and mother- in- law of the appellant (143-146) and the Investigating Officer D/C. Kumar (146-147). The appellant did not give evidence and did not call any witnesses but rather exercised his right to remain silent. 
 
 
Evidence of the victim
 
 
[7] At the time of giving evidence in 2012 the victim was 14 years of age. The charges span from the year 2006 to 2010. The appellant is the father of the victim. The victim was living with her mother, father (appellant), two brothers and a younger sister. She described the incidents from 2006. The victim had been used to sleeping in her room. In 2006 the appellant had called her to his room to sleep beside him. That night she said that she felt her father touching her body. The shoulders, breasts and the stomach were caressed. In 2007 when she was attending class 3 in school, the appellant had got down the victim to sleep beside him. This time the appellant had removed her top and kissed her cheek. She was told not to tell anyone. Again in 2008 she recollected that her mother was doing the night shift. The appellant had got her to sleep with him. Her younger brother Ben too had slept next to the appellant. In the night the appellant had inserted his penis into her vagina and had sex with her for a few minutes. She was told to keep it a secret which she says she did.
 
 
[8] Again in 2009 she remembered spending time at her uncle’s with her sister and two brothers. The appellant brought them back to the house. That night the appellant had got her and her younger brother to sleep with him. Whilst she was sleeping the appellant had started touching her shoulders and breasts. When her mother returned home the appellant had not opened the door for her. When she knocked again, the appellant had got Ben to open the door. After that her parents had had a fight and the appellant had slept with Ben in the sitting room. The appellant having called her several times to come to the sitting room to sleep, she had gone and slept in the sitting room. In the night the appellant had again taken her clothes off and put his penis into her vagina. While he was doing this the mother had come and put the lights on and said in Fijian, the translation of which is that “Akuila (appellant) see what you have done to this child, filthy”. The mother had wanted to go to the police. The appellant did not allow her. In the morning the mother had asked the appellant to buy some biscuits from the shop. While the appellant was away the mother had inquired about the happenings and she had revealed everything to her. 
 
 
[9] Again in 2010 while her mother was away the appellant had started to touch her body. The appellant had told the victim that his wife is refusing to have sex with him and that that is the reason for behaving in this manner. She also said that the appellant had given her $5 to keep her mouth shut. She said that in April 2011 (referred to as last year while giving evidence in 2012) she had told about this to her grandmother. Referring to the time she said that, that was the day her grandmother came to take away the brush cutter. That time she had taken the two granddaughters with her. It was on the following day that this was revealed to the grandmother in her house. On the same day they had gone to the police. After going to the police station, the grandmother had lodged a complaint. Later the victim was examined by a lady doctor. 
 
 
[10] In the evening the victim’s mother and the appellant had come to the grandmother’s house and started a fight. Answering the question in cross-examination “what you have told the court that your father had sex with you is a false story she said “no it is a true story” (pg. 135). When it was suggested to her that nothing had happened in the sitting room between her and her father in 2009, she accepted it. She denied it when she was told that in 2008 nothing had happened between her and her father. She categorically said that in 2008 she had sexual intercourse with her father (136). Again when she was asked as to what she had told the police regarding 2008 she said, “I told them that father and I had sexual intercourse”.
 
 
[11] At page 138 she said that it was in 2009 that her mother saw father having sex with her. She also denied when it was suggested to her that she lied to court about touching her. “I put it to you, you lied to court about touching you”. “No I did not lie”. Again she answered as follows to a question suggesting that she was lying. “I am putting it to you that you lied to court about your father touching you”. She said, “I am not lying. I am telling the truth”. She also denied when it was suggested to her that her grandmother coached her to make a false allegation against the appellant (pg 139). Q. Is it true you have been coached by your grandmother to make a false allegation against your father? A. No, that is not true. However the last question by the learned counsel for the defence is as follows. Q. Do you agree the complaint of rape is false? A. Yes (pg. 140). It is to be noted that the questions prior to that are questions to which the answer had to be yes. As to this answer the learned counsel for the prosecution and the learned trial Judge got no clarification. Considering the manner of answering questions in relation to rape, it appears that this answer alone would not negate her previous position that she was raped.
 
 
Medical evidence
 
 
[12] Dr. Hanif has obtained her MBBS from the Fiji School of Medicine in 2009. She had been working at the Namaka Health Centre. While she was working at the Nadi Hospital in their General Outpatient Department she had dealt with 5 to 10 cases of sexual abuse. The victim was examined by her on 26 April 2011 at 11 a.m. She was told by the victim that she was sexually assaulted by her father on several occasions. She has recorded this as the history of the victim. On examination she had found that her hymen was not intact. The reason may be vaginal penetration. Under cross-examination she admitted that the reason for the absence of the hymen could be due to vigorous sports activity and also congenital absence of it. In this case however there is no evidence of the victim having engaged in any kind of sports activities. 
 
 
The Grandmother’s Evidence
 
 
[13] She has 9 children and 18 grand children. She remembered the date 22 April 2011. On that day she had gone to her daughter Livia to collect her brush-cutter. That day she had taken her two granddaughters to her house. It was on the following day that the victim had told her that she was raped by the appellant. She had related all happenings from 2006 onward. In 2008 she had told that she was raped three times. It had occurred on two occasions while her mother was away from home at work doing night shifts. In 2009 the appellant had raped her in a hotel in Suva. The same year the appellant had got caught to his wife while having sex with the victim.
 
 
[14] After this revelation she had gone to the police and lodged a complaint. The victim too had made a statement. After that they had gone to the hospital. The hospital was found closed. That day the appellant had come to her house with his wife Livia. Livia is her daughter. Livia had cried and said that the appellant would have to spend about 15 to 18 years in prison. She had also told the witness not to treat her as her daughter and told the daughters not to treat her as their mother as everything had been told to the grandmother. The witness said that her relationship with the appellant had previously been very good. That was one reason for giving them her grass cutter to be used. Her relationship with her daughter Livia too was very good. Whenever Livia’s two daughters fell ill the witness took them with her to look after. Prior to 2011, Livia had worked in a hotel. Even after this incident her relationship with the appellant was good. The appellant had asked this witness to pray for him and inquired whether this case could be closed. In cross-examination she said that she used to go to the victim’s house on many occasions and had also taken the victim and her sister to her place many a time. She used to talk to them. She said she used to give them money and buy food and do shopping with them.
 
 
The grounds of appeal under conviction
 
 
Ground A was withdrawn.
 
 
Ground B -Expert opinion
 
 
[15] The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge whilst explaining evidence of Dr. Mrs. Hanif had failed to direct the Assessors on how to deal with expert evidence. The impugned decision is in paragraph 22 of the summing up (pg. 57) which is as follows:
 
 
“The witness called was Dr. Mrs. Salma Hanif. She gave evidence and produced the Medical Report which she prepared after examining the virtual complainant. She said she had examined the virtual complainant on the 26.4.2011 at the General Outpatients Department of Nadi Hospital. She didn’t find any external injuries on the virtual complainant; at vaginal examination she had found that the hymen was not intact. She is of the view that there was vaginal penetration. She also told court that the hymen can be damaged due to vigorous exercise and sports activities. It is also possible with congenital absence”. 
 
 
[16] The learned counsel submitted that the trial judge should have directed the Assessors that the doctor was giving opinion evidence which the Assessors are not bound to follow and the weight to be attached to it is a matter for them to decide. In R. v Stockwell (1993) 97 Cr. App R at 266 the court said, “It is for you to evaluate that evidence along with all other evidence in the case. You decide whether or not to accept and to agree with his evidence as a whole or in fact, or to reject it altogether”.
 
 
[17] The learned counsel further submitted that the examination was done by the doctor 5 years after the first incident and 4 months after the last incident. The learned counsel further submitted that the opinion of the doctor that the hymen was not intact and that there was vaginal penetration failed to expressly implicate the appellant as the perpetrator. As such, the failure to adequately direct the Assessors that they are not bound by the expert opinion and the weight to be attached to it has caused substantial prejudice to the appellant. 
 
 
Argument of the learned counsel for the respondent on ground B
 
 
[18] The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the learned judge did not err and also that there has been no occurrence of a miscarriage of justice. The learned counsel submitted that the learned trial judge has made it amply clear in paragraphs 2, 30 and 33 (pgs. 54, 59 and 60) of his summing up that it was a matter for the fact finders what to make of the evidence. The learned counsel submitted strenuously that expert evidence does not fall into a special category which a trial judge is required as a matter of law to give specific directions in relation to such evidence.
 
 
[19] The medical evidence is unchallenged. That evidence is that the hymen of the victim is not intact. At the time of giving evidence the victim was 14 years of age. There is no evidence of the victim associating with any males. The only man with whom she had had sex with was her own father. The medical opinion for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration. That is due to having had sex with someone. The doctor cannot say who that someone is. The victim’s evidence is that it is the father. Although it was suggested to the doctor that a girl of the age of the victim can lose the hymen due to vigorous sports activity, there is no such evidence. It is true that the learned Judge had failed to analyse the evidence and explain that the Assessors are not bound by the opinion of the doctor that the losing of the hymen was due to vaginal penetration. The learned Judge said to the Assessors that they are Judges of facts. He also said that if an opinion had been expressed by him with regard to facts, that the Assessors are not obliged to accept it. The Assessors were told that they have to consider all the evidence and decide. It appears that there is no strict rule to say that the trial Judge is bound to tell the Assessors that they are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor. It was held in Fitz Patrick [1999] Crim. L.R. 832 that a failure slavishly to follow this formula does not automatically render a conviction unsafe. In this case I am of the view that it would have been better if the Judge said to the Assessors that they are not bound by the opinion expressed by the doctor that the reason for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration. In addition to the opinion expressed by the doctor the vaginal penetration has been established through the evidence of the victim and the grandmother. Therefore not giving a warning that the Assessors are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor cannot be considered as fatal. However by considering the fact that the evidence led was short and it not being a complex case, no prejudice was caused and no miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
 
 
Ground C 
 
 
[20] This ground is that the learned judge has erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in cross examination when the defence counsel suggested the proposition to the victim that the complaint of rape was false, her answer was “yes” (pg. 140). The prosecution however failed to clarify on this issue and therefore this piece of evidence was unchallenged and could have caused a reasonable doubt in the evidence of the victim and her credibility. The learned counsel submitted that the unchallenged evidence that `the allegation of rape was false was enough for the Assessors to draw an inference that the victim of the crime was not a credible witness and that there was a serious doubt whether the alleged offence actually happened or not. It was necessary for the trial judge to put before the Assessors clearly and fairly this argument in the summing up. The Court of Appeal held in Tamaibeka v State [1999] FJCA 1: AAU 0015u.97s (8 January 1999) that, “The duty of a judge in any criminal trial...is adequately and properly performed...if he puts before the jury, clearly and fairly, the contentions of either side, omitting nothing from this charge, so far as the defence is concerned, of the real matters upon which the defence, but that does not mean to say he is to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence...”
 
 
[21] The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the error is substantial and has caused the trial to miscarry. The unchallenged admission by the victim of crime that the allegation of rape was false clearly indicates that the appellant is innocent and hence the learned counsel for the appellant moved that the conviction be quashed.
 
 
Submission by the learned counsel for the respondent
 
 
[22] The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the victim had already repeatedly denied the allegation that she was lying. The trial judge refers to this in paragraph 21 of the summing up as follows: “You heard the defence counsel suggest to the virtual complainant that these incidents never happened and she is lying in court. The complainant had rejected these suggestions. I request you to consider the suggestions made by the counsel for the accused in the light of all the evidence before the court. The defence counsel also submits that the virtual complainant had contradicted herself with her own evidence and the evidence of other witnesses. It is up to you to decide whether the virtual complainant is making mistakes or deliberately lying in court”.
 
 
[23] The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that notwithstanding this answer, it was clearly open to the Assessors and the judge to find the appellant guilty on the totality of the evidence.
 
 
[24] I have reproduced the related questions and answers in paragraphs 10 and 11 of this judgment. It is unfortunate for both the prosecuting counsel as well as the learned judge to overlook the answer given by the victim to a question that was put to her. Having considered all the questions and answers given I am of the view that the answer given as “yes” would have been nothing but a slip. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the failure of the learned counsel for the accused to address this issue in his address to the Assessors shows that this answer “yes” did not mean a denial of the incident. Omitting to refer to this solitary answer by the learned judge itself did not cause a miscarriage of justice.
 
 
Grounds on Sentence
 
 
Ground A
 
 
[25] The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the period of remand should have been discounted separately after computing the sentence. Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 provides that, “If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender”.
 
 
[26] The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge, prior to the passing of 18 years imprisonment had considered the 9 months period the appellant had spent in remand. This was considered as a mitigating factor. The complaint of the learned counsel is the timing of the consideration of the period spent in remand. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that a departure from the best practice does not render the sentence wrong in principle. The learned counsel further submitted that the trial judge has been too lenient in allowing a total deduction of 5 years. 
 
 
[27] Section 24 requires any period the offender had spent in custody to be considered as part of the term of imprisonment served. In this case the period spent in custody is 9 months. The sentence is 18 years. The following factors have been considered in mitigation, namely; 
 
a) Having five more children. 
 
b) Being a first offender.
 
c) Nine months period spent in remand.
 
d) A letter from the wife requesting that the appellant be given a second chance in life.
 
e) Wife claiming that she needs the support of the husband.
 For the above mitigating factors the learned Judge has deducted 5 years.
 
 
[28] It appears that the above items (d) and (e) do not qualify to be as mitigatory factors. Obviously the huge reduction is after considering the 9 month period of incarceration. Although this 9 month period should have been reduced after passing the sentence, considering the huge reduction already given, I find that no prejudice has been caused to the appellant. Therefore this ground is without merit. 
 
 
Ground B  
 
 
[29] The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial Judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature. The learned counsel complains that the learned Judge had erred in law when he considered the fact of having sexual intercourse on many occasions as an aggravating factor. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the impugned comment relates to the fact that this is not a single offence. That is an aggravating factor distinct from the element of the offence. 
 
 
[30] It is an accepted principle that no person should be sentenced for offences not charged. When a person is charged on the basis of a representative count the number of incidents of the offences covered in that count should not be taken as an aggravating factor. On each representative count the victim testified on one incident of rape/indecent assault. Therefore within each count repetitive offending cannot be taken as an aggravating factor. However I find that the learned trial Judge has considered the totality principle in sentencing when he considered the repetitive sexual acts in all five counts. The learned Judge has not considered repetitive acts within each count, but in all five counts. Therefore a Judge is entitled to apply the principle of totality and use them as aggravating factors. This principle was recently enunciated in Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 0003.2014 (20 August 2014). Gates CJ held that, 
 
 
“The high level of the sentence had its origin in the seriously aggravating factors which were identified by the Judge in his sentencing remarks. They were: i. The petitioner was the complainant’s stepfather who should have protected her. Instead he breached the trust expected of him, and the breach was gross. ii. The rape offence took place continuously over a long period of time. Such an experience “will surely scar her for the rest of her life”. iii. She was a child 10 years. The age of the child, if very young, could yet be an aggravating factor.”
 
 
[31] Therefore I am of the view that the learned Judge has correctly considered the continuous sexual acts as aggravating factors. 
 
 
Ground C
 
 
[32] The learned counsel for appellant submits that the sentence is in breach of section 14 (2) (n) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji Islands. The section is as follows, “Every person charged with an offence has the right to the benefit of the least severe of the prescribed punishment if the prescribed punishment for the offence has changed between the time the offence was committed and the time of sentencing; and...”. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that fixing the starting point at 15 years offends section 14 (2) (n) of the Constitution. To conform to the provisions of the Constitution the starting point should have been 10 years.
 
 
[33] The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that section 14 (2) (n) has no application as the punishment for the offence of rape (life imprisonment) has not changed between the time the offence was committed and the time of imposing the sentence. I too agree that section 14 (2) (n) has no application and this ground too is without merit. 
 
 
 [34] In the circumstances I am of the view that ground B on conviction and ground A on the sentence are arguable and hence leave is granted only on those two grounds and refused on the rest of the grounds. However for the reasons adumbrated the appeal is dismissed. 
 
 
Gamalath JA
 
 
[35] I agree with the reasoning and the conclusions of Basnayake JA.
 
 
Fernando JA
 
 
[36] I too agree with the reasoning and the conclusions of Basnayake JA.
 
 
The Orders of the Court are:
  
  
• Leave granted on ground B on the conviction and ground A on the sentence. Leave refused on the rest of the grounds.
 
• Appeal is dismissed.

• The accused is before the Court for sentence, after being convicted to the following charge.
 

Statement of offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
 Particulars of Offence
 
 
JOSEVA QIOKATA on the 8th day and 9th day of September, 2010 at Nadi, in the Western Division inserted his penis into the vagina of JR without her consent.
 
  
• You pleaded not guilty to above charge. Following trial lasting three days in this Court, you were found guilty on above count against you.
 
 
• After considering the unanimous verdict of Guilty of the assessors and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial, the Court decided to concur with the verdict of the assessors and found you guilty of the above charge and convicted you.
 
 
• The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. The 22 year old victim JR was married with two children. She was 4 months pregnant. You are from the same settlement. You had invited the husband to go to a night club. You have left him there and come to the complainant's house. You forced open the door, dragged the victim out and raped her. 
 
 
• You had no remorse for your above conduct.
 
 
• You are not a first offender. 
 
 
• According to the Crimes Decree, the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for Life. It is a serious offence. The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates in State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.
 
 
• In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed 
 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
  
• Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 7 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Aggravating factors;
  
• (a) Victim is your neighbor, you breached the trust between neighbors
 
• (b) You are not remorseful
 
• (c) This is a planned offence 
 
• (d) The victim was pregnant
 


Considering all, I increase your sentence by 4 years, now the sentence is 11 years imprisonment.
 
  
• Mitigating circumstances;
  
• (a) Family depending on you and you are father of three children 
 

 
• Considering above, I reduce 1 year from your sentence now your sentence is 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
• You were in remand from 10.9.2010 to 28.9.2010 and again from 3.3.2014 to 26.3.2014 for a period of 41 days. I deduct that 2 months from your sentence. Now your sentence is 9 years and 10 months. 
 
 
• Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 8 years as non-parole period.
 
 
• You are sentenced to 9 years and 10 months imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 8 years of imprisonment.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

• Mr. Pajiliai Bale, you have been charged with one count of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and one count of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for these two counts on the 31st of May 2017 and 01st of December 2017 respectively. Having satisfied that you have pleaded guilty on your own free will and understood the consequence of your plea of guilty, I now convict you for each of these two counts as charged. 
 
 
• According to the summary of facts, which was submitted by the prosecution and admitted by you in open court, you have committed these crimes on the victim while she came for a family gathering at her grandfather’s place. You are related to her as her cousin. You were staying with your grandfather at his house. You were watching TV with other kids, including the victim in a room while the elders were having their gathering. At that point of time, you went closer to the victim and licked her vagina. You then penetrate her vagina with your finger. You told her not to tell anyone. 
 
 
• This is a case of sexual exploitation of a child by a known relative within her own family environment. She is your cousin. The victim was 8 years old at the time this crime took place. The family environment is the most protective and appropriate environment for a child to grow up with confidence and safety. Close family members and relatives are the most trusted and dependable people surrounded during the developmental stages of a child. Therefore, sexually assaulting a child within her own family environment by a known family member is one of the outrageous forms of sexual crime. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this offence, it is my opinion that such offenders must be dealt with severe and harsh punishment. Hence, the purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence and protection of community. Moreover, the court must demonstrate in sentencing that the offenders of this nature are socially abhorrent. 
 
 
• Hon. Chief Justice Gates in Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2014) held that the tariff for rape of a child is between 10 -16 years’ imprisonment period. 
 
 
• Justice Madigan in State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca - Sentence [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC252.2011 (14 November 2012) has expounded the tariff for the offence of Sexual Assault as between 2 years to 8 years’ imprisonment, where his Lordship held that: 
 

 “The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment. It is a reasonably new offence, created in February 2010 and no tariffs have been set, but this Court did say in Abdul Kaiyum HAC 160 of 2010 that the range of sentences should be between two to eight years. The top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus. The bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks.
 
 A very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the United Kingdom's Legal Guidelines for Sentencing. Those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories:
 
 
 Category 1 (the most serious)
 
 Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim.
 
 
 Category 2
  
• Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
 
• Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
• Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 

Category 3
 
Contact between part of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia)”.
 
  
• The victim was eight years old at that time. It is clear that a crime of this nature adversely affects a child of this age. Hence, I find the level of harm is substantially high in this crime. 
 
 
•  You have committed this disgraceful sexual crime on the victim in very opportunistic manner. You have exploited her young age and immaturity in order to satisfy your sexual greediness. I accordingly find the decree of culpability in this offending is substantially high. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this crime, and the level of harm and culpability, I select twelve (12) years as the starting point for the offence of Rape and three (3) years for the offence of Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• You have blatantly breached the trust reposed in you by the victim as her cousin. The age difference between you and the victim was about seventeen (17) years at the time of this crime took place. I consider these factors as aggravating circumstances of this crime. 
 
 
• The learned counsel for the defence submitted in mitigation about your family circumstances. However, the family background of the offenders of this nature has very minimal mitigatory value. 
 
 
• You are a first offender. You are 19 years old. Therefore, it is appropriate to give you some substantial discount for your previous good character. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for these two counts at the early stages of this proceeding. By doing that you have save the time of the court and also prevent the victim to recalling all these traumatic ordeal that she had gone through. 
 
 
• In view of the above discussed aggravating circumstances, I increased two (2) years to reach interim imprisonment of fourteen (14) years for the offence of Rape and five (5) years for Sexual Assault. I reduce one (1) year for your previous unblemished character and three (3) years for your early plea of guilt. Your final sentence has now reached to ten (10) years of imprisonment for Rape and one (1) year for Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• Having considered the seriousness of this crime, the purpose of this sentence, your age and opportunities for rehabilitation, I find eight (8) years of non-parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence. Hence, you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight (8) years pursuant to Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 

Head Sentence 
  
• Accordingly, I sentence you for a period of ten (10) years imprisonment for the offence of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1), (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act and one (1) year imprisonment for the offence of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act. I further order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight (8) years. Both sentences to be served concurrently. 
 

Actual Period of Sentence
  
• You have been in remand custody for this case for a period of nearly nine (9) months as you were not granted bail by the court. In pursuant of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider the period of nine (9) months as a period of imprisonment that have already been served by you. 
 
 
• Accordingly your actual sentencing period is nine (9) years and three (3) months of imprisonment, with seven (7) years and three (03) months of non-parole period. 
 
 
• Since this incident involves with domestic violence, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the Domestic Violence Act. I accordingly make a permanent domestic violence restraining order against the accused with standard non-molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to section 24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Act. The above domestic violence restraining order will be in force until this court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it. Furthermore, if you breached this restraining order, you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of section 77 of the Domestic Violence Act.

•  The Accused, Ilisavani Waraimaivuna is charged with one count of Attempted to Commit Rape, contrary to section 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
• The offence of Attempt to Commit Rape is an indictable offence that can be tried summarily, in other words, it is an electable offence where the Accused has the right to elect to be tried at the Magistrate Court or at the High Court. On 15 May 2012, the Accused elected to be tried at this Court. 
 
 
• The Accused on 6 September 2012, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The case was set for hearing on two occasions where it did not proceed as the hearing was vacated. The Accused who is represented by Legal Aid Commission on 19 February 2015, change his plea and pleaded guilty to the charge. I find the plea to be unequivocal. The Accused admitted the summary of facts on the same date and was convicted as charged.
 
 
• The Defence Counsel filed the written mitigation on 23 February 2015.
 
 
• The brief summary of facts is that on 12 May 2012, the Accused, 22 years old attempted to rape the victim a 9 years old girl, class 4, student of Ratu Emeri Catholic School. On the said date at about 1500 hours, the victim was at her home sewing her brother's pants when she heard someone knocking on their door. The victim stood up and opened the door and saw the Accused. The victim tried to run away from the Accused but could not. The Accused grabbed the victim and locked both of her hands. The Accused squeezed and grabbed on to the victim's neck when she tried to scream, the Accused forcefully shuts her mouth and forcefully pushed her down on the floor. The Accused took his pants and t-shirt off and was only wearing his tights on. The victim managed to scream out for help and was heard by her grandfather who was sleeping. The victim's grandfather stood up but the Accused did not release the victim but later released the Victim when he saw the victim's grandfather ran for his cane knife.
 
 
•  The Maximum penalty for attempt to commit rape is 10 years. The tariff is 12 months to 5 years imprisonment, set by Justice Shameem in Aunima v State [2001] FJHC 105 .
 
 
• In this case, the starting point is 3 years imprisonment. I added 3 years for the following aggravating factors and increase the sentence to 6 years;
  
• Unlawful entry into the victim's house.
 
 
• Forceful act of locking the victim's hand, squeezing and grabbing the victim's neck, shutting the victim's mouth, and pushed her down to the floor.
 
 
• Accused took his pants and t-shirt off and only wearing his tights.
 
 
• He was drunk at the time of the offence.
 
 
• The victim who was 9 years old. 
 


8. I reduce 1 year and 5 months for the guilty plea. The Accused pleaded guilty after vacation of two hearing date and therefore not entitle to the full one third reductions. That makes the final sentence to 4 years and 7 months.
 
 
9. I further reduce 2 years for the following mitigation, and that reduce the sentence to 2 years and 7 months;
 
 
 i. First and young offender
 
 
 ii. Remorseful and seek court forgiveness
 
 
 iii. Promise not re-offend
 
 
10. I further reduce 21 days for the period in which the Accused was remanded and that reduce the sentence to 2 years, 6 months, and 10 days. The final sentence is 2 years, 6 months, and 10 days. This is a prevalent offence in Fiji and the victims and the vulnerable member of the public and our community as a whole need to be protected from people like the Accused.
 
 
11. In this case, suspended sentence is not an option as strong message needs to be sends out to people who intend to commit such offence. The imposing of immediate custodial sentence is given to act as a deterrent for those who intend to commit such offence in the future.
 
 
12. The Accused is now sentence to 2 years, 6 months, and 10 days imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.
 
 
 28 days to appeal.

257732,"SENTENCE
 
[1] KRISHNA REDDY, you are now brought before this Court for imposition of your sentence after being convicted on two counts of Rape contrary to Sections 207(1) and (2) (C) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
[2] You pleaded not guilty to the charge of Rape. At the ensuing trial, this Court found you guilty and convicted you on both counts of Rape.
 
 
[3] The victim was only six years old at the time of the offences. You became her stepfather when you married victim’s mother in 2014. The victim called you Papa and looked up to you for love, affection, protection and support. You utterly disregarded your responsibility and sexually exploited her vulnerability. 
 
 [4] You sent victim’s mother to the shop and approached her in a pair of pants that was torn. You then penetrated her mouth with your penis. 
 
[5] In a few weeks later, you repeated the same shameful act on her. 
 
[6] You wielded undue authority over the victim and unleashed violence on her in the guise of disciplining her. You assaulted her in a brutal manner. As a result of which her mother had to complain to her school and to relocate her at her grandmother’s place to ensure her safety. 
 
[7] According to Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, the maximum punishment for Rape is imprisonment for life. Society views Rape as a worst form of sexual assault and an unwarranted invasion of a person’s privacy and dignity. A harsher punishment is warranted not only as retribution but also to protect the young ones in society. A clear message has to be sent to the society that this type of behavior is not tolerated in Fiji.
 
[8] The complainant was 6 years of age at the time of the Rapes and therefore, is a child. The tariff for Rape of a child is affirmed by the Chief Justice Gates in Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12. The starting point of imprisonment for Rape of a child is 10 years. The tariff is between 10 years to 16 years.
 
[9] In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; of 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed thus:
 
""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage.""
 
[10] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, Goundar J, in Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15 has formulated the following guiding principles;
 
""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff.""
 
[11] In the light of the above guiding principles and considering the gravity of offending and the impact on the victim and, I commence your sentence at 11 years for each count of Rape.
 
[12] The aggravating factors are:
  
• You breached the trust the victim had towards you as a stepfather.
 
• The 25 years’ age gap between you and the victim aggravated the offending.
 
• You inflicted violence and thereby instilling fear on the victim, you ensured that the matter was not reported to anybody. 
 
• You exploited the vulnerability of the victim.
 
• The victim had to be relocated from her house due to your violent behavior.
 
• The offences you committed warrant harsher punishment under the Domestic Violent Decree. 
 
• You did not show any remorse or repentance and did not allow her to relieve her ordeal. In the contrary you relentlessly castigated the six-year-old victim as a layer who fabricated a false story to put you in trouble. 

[13] I add 2 years on your sentence for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 13 years’ imprisonment.
 
[14] The mitigating factors are:
  
• You are 34 years old and a father of two children. 
 
• You are a first offender;
 
• You co-operated with the Police during investigations.

[15] I deduct 1 year from your sentence on the above mitigating factors. Now your sentence for each count is 12 years’ imprisonment.
 
[16] In view of the Supreme Court decision in Tora v The State [2015] FJSC 23 and considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose a 9 years of non-parole period.
 
[17] Your final sentence is therefore as follows:
 
For each count of Rape – 12 years of imprisonment with a Non-parole period fixed at 9 years.
 
[18] Having considered the totality principle, I order the sentences to be served concurrently. 
 
 
[19] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

269331,"RULING
 
 
[1] Following a trial in the High Court at Labasa, the appellant was convicted on two counts of rape and sentenced to a total term of 13 years' imprisonment. This is his application for an extension of time for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence.
 
 
[2] The factors to be considered for an enlargement of time are:
 
 
(i) The reason for the failure to comply.
 
(ii) The length of the delay.
 
(iii) Is there a question which justifies serious consideration?
 
(iv) The degree of prejudice to the respondent in enlarging time (Livai Nawalu v The State, unreported Criminal Appeal No. CAV0012/2002; 28 August 2013).
 
 
[3] The appellant was sentenced on 21 June 2011. He filed his appeal in person on 5 September 2012. Subsequently, he engaged Mr. Vakaloloma who also appeared for him at the trial.
 
 
[4] The length of the delay is about 1 year and 3 months. The appellant has not given any compelling reasons for this long delay. The victim gave evidence at the trial. Finality in criminal litigations involving vulnerable victims is an important consideration. Long delays can cause stress or anxiety for the victims. In this case, the length of the delay weighs against the granting of an extension of time. 
 
 
[5] The question is whether there is merit in the grounds of appeal. The grounds of appeal are:
 
 
i) That the learned trial judge failed to give a balanced summing up that resulted in the conviction to be unsafe and unsatisfactory;
 
 
ii) That the learned trial judge failed to properly direct himself and direct assessors according to law when the assessors gave verdict of guilty in this case largely built on the states of mind and identification evidence of the complainant that under all the circumstances of the case, the finding of guilt was unsafe and unsatisfactorily; and
 
 
iii) That the learned trial judge failed to properly direct himself and assessors according to law and facts of identification evidence as in this case, the complainant identified the person who rape her to be having a gold filling in the upper interior teeth, the assessors and the court were shown in court during the hearing that the appellant had no gold teeth in the upper interior teeth, and were shown by opening his mouth that the Appellant has missing teeth in the front interior of his mouth, assessors continue and found him guilty although the identification evidence is important to be considered under all the circumstances of the case, the finding of guilt is unsafe and is unsatisfactory; and
 
 
iv) That the learned trial judge failed to direct assessors on the absence of interviewing officer who were supposed to give evidence, and was not able to be cross examined by the Defence, and was not there to confirm and tender his interview records after the Defence objected and insisted that the interviewing officer to be called to confirm the complainant statement that she identified the rapist at the time of the committal of the offence of rape that the person has gold teeth in the front teeth.
 
 
v) That the learned trial judge failed to direct Prosecution to ensure all its witnesses are present and be called to give evidence and be cross examined by the Defence for the purpose of fair trial, and that such non direction placed the Appellant to disadvantage and that the verdict was therefore unsafe; and
 
 
vi) That the learned judge placed undue emphasis and weight in summing up to the evidence paragraph H – The analysis of the evidence sub-paragraph (ix) and (x) of the identification but never place any emphasis on the issue of the complainant's identification and recollection of the rapist who has gold teeth and evidence of A/IP Viliame Tokalauvere the officer who was told of the identification and assisted in the identification parade, and gave evidence of what he saw during the parade against the Appellant, but failed to confirm when Appellant was asked by the Court to open his mouth and see that the he has no gold teeth in front and has no teeth for that matter to draw any evidential reference which would have impacted the prosecution's case; and
 
 
vii) That the learned judge failed to properly direct himself and the assessors in law and in fact on the issue of ""Gold Teeth"" that it was a matter of identification to confirm the offender's identification then a person without a gold tooth cannot be evidently correct to be the offender without gold teeth.
 
 
[6] The grounds of appeal are indeed poorly drafted. All grounds can be condensed into two issues. The first issue relates to one particular aspect of the identification of the appellant by the complainant. The second issue relates to the prosecution not calling certain witnesses.
 
 
[7] The complainant was a 50 year old woman. She was a widow. She lived with her youngest son in a farming community at the outskirt of Labasa town. The first incident happened in September 2010. In relaying about the first incident, she said she was in her farm at around 10 am when the appellant approached her. He spoke to her for about 30 minutes. She noticed that he had a gold plated tooth. He convinced her that someone was stealing her goat. The complainant left to see if that was true. He followed her and forced her to the ground by pressing her mouth. He then had sexual intercourse without her consent. When he left, the victim said she was too embarrassed to report to anyone.
 
 
[8] On 14 December 2010, the appellant returned to the victim's home at around 10 am. She was outside collecting coconuts when the appellant approached her. He forced her to the ground, covered her mouth and raped her. She again noticed that he had a gold plated tooth.
 
 
[9] On 17 December 2010, that is, three days after the second incident, the victim identified the appellant in a police identification parade. In his caution interview, the appellant denied the allegations.
 
 
[10] At trial the appellant elected to give evidence. He denied the allegation. He said he did not have a gold plated tooth. He opened his mouth and showed it to the court that he did not have a gold plated tooth. However, it was noted that the appellant had some of his teeth missing when he gave evidence at the trial.
 
 
[11] The appellant contends that the trial judge did not give a fair and balanced summing up on the defence case, that is, the appellant did not have a gold plated tooth as alleged by the complainant. At paragraph 13 of the summing up, the trial judge gave directions that the appellant's case was that since he did not have a gold plated tooth, he was not the man who raped the complainant as alleged by her. The trial judge left this issue to the assessors to determine by giving clear directions on the identification evidence in accordance with the guidelines in Turnbull [1976] 2 ALL ER 549. The directions are contained at paragraphs 26,27,28,29 and 30 of the summing up. The directions are correct in law and fact. If there were indeed any misdirection, counsel for the appellant could have raised it with the trial judge (Anand Abhay Raj v The State unreported Criminal Appeal No. CAV003 of 2014; 20 August 2014). No re-direction was sought by counsel at trial. This issue of identification is not arguable. 
 
 
[12] As far as the issue of calling of the witnesses is concerned, the prosecution did not rely on those witnesses. Nor did the prosecution rely on the appellant's caution interview. There was no need for the interviewing officer to give evidence. In any event, if the defence required the interviewing officer or any other witness who was not called by the prosecution, they could have made an application before the trial judge to have the witness available for cross-examination. By not seeking to have the witness available for cross-examination, the appellant has waived any arguable complaint. 
 
 
[13] The appellant has not advanced any ground of appeal against sentence.
 
 
Result
Extension of time refused.
Leave to appeal refused.

80046,"SENTENCE

SLAVERY & TRAFFICKING IN CHILDREN

[1] The two accused, Inoke Raikadroka and Mohammed Sagaitu were convicted after trial of the offences as set out in the schedule hereto.

[2] The facts of the case were that in the middle of the year in 2012, the first accused (""Inoke"") had met four girls in a Suva City park one night. Three of the girls were sisters aged 18, 17 and 15 at the time and the fourth was their friend. All had been working as sex workers under the control of one Darren. The two younger sisters are Girl 'X' (aged 17) and Girl 'Y' (aged 15) referred to it in the charges. At the time the girls appeared to be destitute with no place to go so he, knowing that they were Darren's ""girls"" made them a proposition. He took them for dinner followed by a drink party in his room at the Elixir Motel. At that party they discussed the sex business, fees, the splitting of fees for commission, and he asked them if they were prepared to work for him. They agreed but then immediately arose the ""Darren"" problem. Darren had heard that his girls had gone with Inoke and he was therefore texting Inoke, making vile threats and demanding to know where they were. Inoke kept the two younger sisters there for 2-3 months at the Elixir Motel, having them provide sexual services for clients that he arranged. At first he received a commission from the fee paid but later he asked from them for all of the money which they gave to him in return for their ""keep"". That keep consisted of the room charge being paid, food, entertainment by way of drugs and alcohol, beautification and nice clothes and shoes – all to make more attractive his ""products"" as he referred them as in his cautioned interview. The girls had come from a dysfunctional family where the parents were separated, the father was an alcoholic, there was a domineering and erratic grandmother. Many times there was no food in the house and they were sent to school without lunch or lunch money.

[3] When the clients became scarce and the expenses too high, Inoke moved operations from the motel room to a flat he rented at Raiwai. He moved the girls with him and from there they continued the business of providing sexual services, Inoke arranging clients and arranging for them to go to hotels or motels to service the clients. The second accused from thereon figures prominently in that he too arranged clients and took the girls by taxi usually to their assignments. There was no doubt that he knew what the girls were going to do on those occasions. 

[4] After a few months in Raiwai, they all went their own ways after an altercation with the neighbours. The girls moved to a motel and the first accused went to Nadi to try something new because as he said in evidence ""sex work has a shelf life"". It would seem that nothing ""new"" eventuated because at different times the two sisters ('X' and 'Y') went to Nadi on arrangement by Inoke to provide sexual services to clients that he had secured there.

The Offences

[5] Slavery is committed when a person either inside or outside Fiji intentionally owns a slave or exercises over a slave any of the powers attaching to the right of ownership[1]. There are other limbs of the offence which do not pertain to this case. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment.

[6] Reduced to simple terms then the offence denotes having a person with you and doing things in respect of that person which would be indicative of ownership.

[7] In this case the evidence of ""ownership"" came from three sources:

	1.	A description by the accused of the girls as his ""products"",
	2.	His fear of, and hiding the girls from their previous owner ""Darren"" and 
	3.	The manner in which he kept the girls both at the motel and in the flat at Raiwai – selling them for sexual services to clients that he arranged and keeping the money that they earned. This money he spent extravagantly on the girls indulging them in new clothes, shoes, food and alcohol but then slaves can live in palaces as well as sordid hovels. The life of slavery these girls were subjected to was a life of having to provide sexual services on demand and in not retaining the money earned by those services for themselves but all of it going to the ""controller"" or pimp.

[8] Slavery is the utter abuse of the human right to freedom (as recognized in clauses 10 and 11 of Fiji's Constitution 2013) No person may be held in slavery or servitude and every person has the right to freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment.

[9] The treatment of these teenage girls at the hands of the first accused was egregious: they were sold like objects and forced to work with no pay. They were used by him to make profit.

[10] It is perhaps tempting to say that the girls were willing and agreed to this arrangement and therefore they cannot be said to be slaves. Such a proposition however ignores two very important factors. First is that a 15 year or a 17 year old girl is hardly mature enough to know what is good for her, and to realize she is being exploited because she is slim and very attractive; secondly they were inveigled into this servitude by coercive manipulation. It is a condition (and slavery is a condition) that sociologists refer to as ""situational coercion"". The girls coming from a broken, alcoholic home with no food are suddenly confronted with food every day, new clothes, beauty treatments, entertainment and with no real alternative place to go, they were coerced or manipulated by the situation to remain in servitude. A dependency was created which is just as powerful a force as physical threat or force by violence or locks on the door. The situation sadly removed their power of choice.

[11] Apart from this condition of slavery which is obnoxious in itself the situation was aggravated by the fact that the ""slaves"" were children being 17 years and 15 years. Further aggravation can be seen that the condition was extended over a long period of at least seven months and even thereafter the girls were ""on call"" to go to Nadi to service more clients for Inoke.

[12] There has never been a case of slavery in Fiji before, nor has either defence counsel been able to provide authorities from other commonwealth jurisdictions.

[13] Because it is such an outrageous and shameful crime, denying the victim(s) their constitutional and community rights a long term of imprisonment must be imposed.

[14] Fiji has ratified the international treaty called ""Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery"" (1926) (ratified by Fiji in 1972) whereby Article 5 the parties undertake to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading, slave-holding and enslavement. Fiji, being a signatory to the treaty has now enacted laws against slavery with severe penalties, and it is incumbent on the judiciary to honour that sentiment and pass heavy sentences accordingly.

[15] In recognition of the maximum penalty this Court takes a starting point for the crime of ten years imprisonment. For the aggravation of the slaves being children which the Court regards as being very serious indeed I add a further term of 5 years to the sentence. For the aggravation of long term enslavement, I add a further period of two years to the sentence, bringing the interim total to a term of 17 years imprisonment.

[16] In mitigation, counsel for the first accused tells me that Inoke is 24 years old and currently unemployed. He comes from a broken family and was reared by an Aunt. He dropped out of school early – making a living by doing odd jobs before becoming a sex worker. He met the two girl victims in the course of his work and he says they spent 8 months together because they shared the experience of coming from broken homes and of having to survive through sex work. He still maintains that he had no interest in being a slave master but wanted merely to provide for them and treat them as family.

[17] Inoke has one previous charge for theft and he is still serving a suspended sentence for that offence. He can therefore have no credit for being of good character. Nor do his family circumstances afford any great degree of credit.

[18] However in recognition of his time spent in custody, his pathetic upbringing which forced him ""onto the streets"" and his generosity towards his girls I deduct two years from the sentence. I deduct a further year for his relative youth meaning he will serve a total sentence of 14 years for this crime.

[19] This is the sentence I pass for each of Count One and Count Two. 

[20] Each term (for Count One and Count Two) will be served concurrently.

Domestic Trafficking in Children

""Trafficking is a breach of human rights because it objectifies human beings""[2].

[21] As with slavery, this offence has never come before the Courts in Fiji before and therefore there are no authorities that establish an appropriate sentence for the offence.

[22] Domestic trafficking in children created by s.117 of the Crimes Decree 2009 is proved by:

(i) Moving a person from A to B in Fiji.
(ii) The person is under the age of 18.
(iii) The mover intends that after he moves the person to point B the person will be used for sexual services or otherwise exploited.
[23] ""Moving"" the child is a very widely defined term – it can be arranging or facilitating. In this present case, the first accused at times organized transport to collect one of the girls, at other times accompanied a girl to the place of assignation. The second accused more often that not would accompany the girl in a taxi to the motel/apartment and wait in the hope that he would get a ""tip"".

[24] There have been two previous trafficking cases in Fiji, but not of children and both were international trafficking. In the case of Murti [2010] FJHC 514 per Goundar J. (November 2010) it concerned an Indian national who organized the transportation of seven fellow countrymen to travel to New Zealand claiming that he had work for them there. Each paid about 150,000 rupees for the transport. He had them transit through Fiji, where he planned to abandon them. At the border, an official became suspicious and detained all 8 men. The facilitator was charged with trafficking under s.112(3) of the Crimes Decree (an offence which has extra-territorial jurisdiction). After trial, the learned Judge found that the act of abandoning them without funds was an act of recklessness as to exploitation. In his sentence, Goundar, J. said:

""The Crimes Decree 2009 which came into effect in February 1st, 2010 create a number of offences designed to fulfill Fiji's obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Transitional Organised Crime and two of its three protocols, the protocol to prevent, suppress & punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children (the Trafficking Protocol) and the protocol against the smuggling of migrants by Land, Sea and Air.

Although Fiji has not signed these international conventions, by criminalizing human trafficking and smuggling under the Domestic Law, Fiji has shown commitment to effectively address this global problem. Trafficking is a human rights issue. Traffickers are motivated by greed to take advantage of vulnerable victims. Traffickers are motivated by greed to take advantage of vulnerable victims. Traffickers use coercive tactics including deception, fraud, imitation, isolation treat and use of physical force.........to control their victims. The victims are generally subjected to degrading forms of exploitation such as forced prostitution, domestic servitude and other kinds of work"".

[25] In the Murti case the Judge sentenced the trafficker to 6 years imprisonment while saying that there was no evidence of physical exploitation.

In the case of Laojindemanee and Others HAC 323/12, a case decided in this Court, the traffickers had brought three Thai girls into the country. The girls having been told that they were going to work as masseuses in an idyllic setting by the sea, it was only on arrival that they learned that they were to become sex workers. Although there was international trafficking from Thailand, there was one element of domestic trafficking in the case where there was a driver employed to bring the girls from Nadi Airport to Suva City where they were to be based. He was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment; factors being in his favour that he was a rather small cog in this wheel of crime syndicate trafficking. The girls were all adults and there was no evidence that he knew he was driving them to exploitation. The maximum penalty for the crime was 12 years.

Neither Murti nor Laojindemanee are applicable to this case where the trafficking is of children, the children were being exploited for gain and the maximum penalty is 25 years.

[26] The accepted tariff for rapes of children is from 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj AAU 0038. 2014) and there is no reason why domestic trafficking in children should not attract a sentence which is similar if not greater than that range. While not detracting from the crime of rape of a child which is an abominable crime, trafficking a child for sexual services is more serious in that it is not one single act of violence, but is the making available a child for innumerable sexual acts for money. This money is not recompensed directly to the child as a reward but is used by either the first accused or the second accused as profit that they would spend on themselves and the girls. The sexual services to be demanded of the child after transportation were of course unknown and the potential for sexual abuse is immeasurable. The knowledge and intent of either of the accused that a payment had or would be paid to ""perform"" the sexual acts demanded removes any power the child might have had to consent or not to whatever act that was demanded of her. This exploitation for financial gain is unspeakably loathsome.

[27] There is no reason why this crime should not attract sentences in the range of 12 to 18 years.

[28] I take a starting point for each of the trafficking convictions of 15 years. In looking at the first accused separately I add to that a term of 3 years for the fact that Girl 'X' told the Court that when the first accused ""took her in"", she had no idea of what to in being a sexual worker, and at the initial ""orientation"" party in the Elixir Motel, the first accused was a party to a ""training"" demonstration set up by another girl to show her how to ""please"" a man. To pervert a 17 year old girl in such manner is seriously aggravating. From the interim total of 18 years, I deduct 2 years from that total for the first accused's relative youth and pathetic childhood which forced him into the trade. He does not have a clear record which would allow any further discount. The final sentence for the first accused for each of the trafficking charges will be a term of 16 years. These terms are to be served concurrently with each other and concurrent to the term imposed for slavery, making a total term of imprisonment for the first accused to be one of sixteen years. He will serve a minimum of 14 years imprisonment before being eligible for parole.

[29] For the second accused I take the same starting point of 15 years imprisonment for each of the two trafficking offences he has been convicted of.

[30] The second accused is also 24 years old and from a broken home. He has supported himself by odd jobs and sex work since he was 12 years old. He has a clear record. His counsel says that he is remorseful which I have indeed seen throughout the trial, unlike the first accused who has shown no remorse whatsoever and has even an occasions shouted out his views from the dock.

[31] To his credit, the second accused has devoted time and effort to a sex workers' union known as SAN. Little is known of what the union does for the sex workers, but if nothing else education on the severe penalties contained in our Crimes Decree for offences of slavery and trafficking should be high on their agenda. The second accused's membership of the union does in some respects work against him because a union should be in a position to protect children from the more wretched and ignominious facts of sex work.

[32] There is no aggravating features of the second accused's crimes to add to the sentence. The crime itself subsumes the unsavoury and despicable features of the offence. He does have a good deal of mitigation in his favor:

	i.	Clear record
	ii.	Relative youth
	iii.	Time in remand
	iv.	A wretched childhood forcing him to live by his own wits since 12 years old
	v.	Obvious remorse.

[33] His work in the sex workers union cancels itself out by credit for such help as opposed to the union's essential role to educate sex workers.

[34] For the mitigating features above I deduct a period of three years meaning that the second accused will serve a total term of 12 years for each of the two trafficking offences he has been convicted of. These terms will be served concurrently and he will serve a minimum term of 10 years before being eligible for parole.

Summary

1st accused: 
Counts 3, 4, 6, 7 & 9 
14 years concurrent.

Counts 1 & 2.
16 years concurrent.

All counts to be served concurrently making a total sentence of 16 years. Eligible for parole after 14 years.

2nd accused:
Count 5 and 8
12 years concurrent. 

Eligible for parole after 10 years.

81266,"SENTENCE

1. In a judgment delivered on 28th May 2010, the court found you guilty as charged on one count of ""indecent assault"", contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 17 (ie. count No.1), two counts of ""rape"", contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (ie. count Nos. 2 and 3), and one count of ""incest"", contrary to section 178(1) of the Penal Code (ie. count No.6). You were convicted as charged on all those counts.

2. The brief facts of the case were as follows. On 9th November 1995, you married MD. On 15th October 1996, you two had your first child, SM, the complainant. She was your eldest daughter. You then had two more girls from your wife, until you two separated in 2005. The custody of the girls were given to you. In January 2006, you and the three girls resided at .. Wailea Street Vatuwaqa. Your abuse on SM started at this address. Between the 26th and 27th January 2006, you indecently assaulted SM, who was 9 years 3 months old at the time. You indecently kissed her, touched her breast and fondled her vagina.

3. You then moved to another residence, at Lot . Vusavusa Road, Vatuwaqa in February 2006. Between the 11th and 18th February 2006, your abuse on SM reached another level. One night you woke SM from her sleep, told her to take off her clothes, then you raped her by forcefully inserting you erected penis into her vagina, until you ejaculated. SM did nothing and said nothing. You then next shifted to ... Fletcher Road, Vatuwaqa with the three girls. At that address, you again forced yourself on SM, between the 19th and 28 February 2006. You forcefully inserted your erected penis into S’s vagina in the bathroom. You carried on for about 3 minutes, until S pleaded for you to stop, as it was hurting her. You did stop, had your bath and went out of the bathroom.

4. In May 2006, you next moved in with a pastor at ...... Settlement, Newtown. You took your three girls with you. Between the 1st and 31st May 2006, you again forced yourself on S, who was aged 9 years 7 months, at the time. One night, you told S to take off her pants, you then massaged your penis with oil, and then forcefully inserted it into her vagina, until you ejaculated.

5. The court has carefully read your antecedent report, and your well prepared written plea in mitigation. It has also read the victim’s impact report. The court noted you are first offender, at the age of 42 years old. It also noted that you are divorced, with three young daughters. You are a pastor in a Christian church, and you are very remorseful for the offences.

6. You have committed three sexual offences against your daughter. In terms of seriousness, the rape offence is the most serious, followed by incest and then indecent assault. We will begin with the offence of rape.

7. Rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Since SM was aged 9 years 4 months at the time of the rape, the case is really about the rape of a child. The tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 13 years imprisonment. See State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; Tevita Poese v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0010 of 2005, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Fong Toy, Criminal Appeal Case No. HAA 003 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v Nacanieli Marawa, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2003, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence passed will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

8. Committing ""incest"" against a child under 13 years carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The tariff for incest against a child under 13 years old is a sentence between 10 to 14 years imprisonment: Babu Ram v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0023 of 2004L, High Court, Lautoka. The actual sentence will again depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

9. The maximum sentence for ""indecent assault"" is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff is a sentence between 1 to 4 years imprisonment: Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 068 of 2002, High Court, Suva; State v Viliame Tamani,Criminal Case No. HAC 007 of 2003S, High Court, Suva. Again the actual sentence passed, will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors. 

10. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows: 

(i) Serious breach of parental trust. S was 9 years 4 months old when you indecently assaulted her, and then raped her twice in February 2006. She was already traumatized by the break up of your family in 2005. She looked to you for fatherly support and guidance, in her young life. She trusted you as a father. You were supposed to respond in kind. You were supposed to guide and counselled her to become a strong and confident young girl. However, you did exactly the opposite. You ruined her world by indecently assaulting her, and raping her twice. Then you committed incest on her.

(ii) Your daughter S appears to be emotionally scarred for life. According to the victim impact report, she repeatedly has emotional mood swings. At times, she cries without a reason. She has very low self esteem. She is frightened of you, and frighten most of the time. She gets so angry easily, and wants to be left alone on most occasions. She stares a lot. Her school grades have deteriorated. She shuts down when questioned. On occasions, she changes from a happy little girl to an angry one, and then a dump one.

(iii) According to her medical report, dated 12th June 2009, at the age of 12 years 8 months old, S is sexually active. She has been touched by a cousin, and according to the report, a shopkeeper in Rewa Street performed oral sex on her. These are the by-products of your offending. You turned your own daughter into this kind of world. Instead of living her life as a young innocent girl, she is now being exposed to the above kind of world. In a sense, your have ruined her life as a child, given your offending. 

(iv) Through your offending, you have shown a total disregard to S’s right to live a happy and peaceful life, not only as a child, but also when she grows into the adult world.

11. The mitigating factors were as follows:

(i) At the age of 42 years old, this is your first offence.
(ii) You pleaded guilty to the indecent assault charge (count No.1) at the beginning of the trial.
(iii) You are remorseful.
(iv) You have spent a few weeks in prison, while being remanded in custody.

12. On the rape charge, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 17 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 2 years from the 17 years, leaving a balance of 15 years imprisonment.

13. On the incest charge, I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I add 4 years, making a total of 15 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year from the 15 years, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment.

14. On the indecent assault charge, I start with a sentence of 2 years prison. I add 2 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 4 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year, leaving a balance of 3 years.

15. I sentence you as follows:

Count No. 1
indecent assault
3 years imprisonment
Count No. 2
rape
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 3
rape
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 6
incest
14 years imprisonment

16. Given the principle of the totality of sentence, I order all the above sentences to be made concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 15 years imprisonment.

17. To assist S recover from her ordeal, her name, including that of her father, are suppressed permanently, to protect her privacy.

Gates, P
 
  
• I have read the judgment of Hettige J in draft. I agree with his Lordship’s conclusions, the reasons, and with the orders proposed.

 
 Marsoof, J
 
  
• I have read the judgment of Hettige J, in draft, and agree with his conclusions and proposed orders.

 Sathyaa Hettige, J
 
  
• This is an application for special leave to appeal against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 8th March 2018 affirming conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner by the High Court on three counts of rape and one count of sexual assault and dismissal of his appeal by the Court of Appeal.
  
• By the Information dated 29th October 2012 the petitioner was charged with three counts of rape and one count of sexual assault committed by the petitioner against his brother’s daughter, ‘AN’ (name is suppressed) in the High Court of Fiji at Lautoka as follows: -
  
• (i) Count one: Petitioner on the 17th day of September 2012 at Nadi in the Western Division unlawfully and indecently assaulted ‘AN’ by licking the vagina of the said ‘AN’ with his tongue contrary to section 210 (1) (a) and (2) of the Crimes Decree, No 44 of 2009 ( now Crimes Act, 2009) 
 



(ii) Count two: The petitioner on the 17th day September 2012 at Nadi Western Division had carnal Knowledge of ‘AN’ without her consent contrary to section 207(1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 (now Crimes Act 2009)
 
 
 (iii) Count three: The petitioner on the 17th day of September 2012 at Nadi in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of ‘AN’ , by inserting his penis into the anus of the said ‘AN’ without her consent contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree of 2009 (now Crimes Act 2009)
 
 (iv) Count four: The petitioner on the 17th day of September 2012 at Nadi in the Western Division penetrated the mouth of ‘AN’ with his penis without her consent contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) © of the Crimes Decree, 2009 ( now Crimes Act 2009)
 
 
• Since the caution interview of the petitioner wherein the petitioner has admitted the commission of the offence was challenged as to the voluntariness and truthfulness of the caution interview statement a ‘voir dire’ trial was conducted from 24th November 2013 to 27th November 2013 by the High court and the learned trial Judge held that the caution interview and charge statement were admissible in evidence.
 
 
• After trial in the High Court which lasted from 27th January 2014 to 30thJanuary 2014 before the assessors who returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty of all four counts against the petitioner, the learned High Court Judge delivered the judgment convicting the petitioner of all four counts as charged and on 5th February 2014 the petitioner was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 13 years 7 months and 15 days for each of the rape convictions and 8 years imprisonment for sexual assault conviction with a non-parole period of 12 years. 
 
 
• Being aggrieved by the decision of the learned High Court Judge the petitioner sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal on five grounds of appeal against the conviction and 3 grounds of appeal against the sentence. On 12th August 2016 the single Judge of the Court of Appeal ( per Callanchini J ) refused the application for leave to appeal as all the grounds urged by the petitioner were not arguable.
 
 
• Being dissatisfied with the decision of the single Judge the petitioner filed the same grounds of appeal to renew his appeal against the conviction and sentence before the Full Court of Appeal on 23 February 2017. However, the grounds of appeal were restricted to 3 grounds of appeal as the counsel for the petitioner did not want to proceed with the 1st and 5th grounds.
 
 
• I would now state below only the 3 grounds of appeal that were argued and heard in the Court of Appeal against the conviction and three grounds of appeal against the sentence.
 

Grounds of Appeal against the Conviction
 
 
 (i) ‘The trial Judge has erred in not adequately directing the assessors on the medical report’
 (ii) ‘The learned trial Judge erred in law by not giving adequate directions of the 1st charge and misdirecting assessors on the 2nd , 3rd and 4th charges when there existed unreliable and insufficient evidence to prove the latter charges.
 (iii) ‘The learned trial Judge erred in not adequately directing the assessors on the circumstantial evidence’
 

Grounds of Appeal against the Sentence
 
 
 (i) ‘The learned Judge failed to pick the starting point on count one from the current sentencing tariff.’ 
 (ii) ‘The learned Judge for counts 2, 3 and 4 chose a higher starting point rather than the set tariff.’
 (iii) The petitioner was punished twice by the presiding Judge for the same facts.’
 
 
• The Full Court of Appeal ( Chandra J, Prematilaka J and Fernando J) on 8th March 2018 dismissed the petitioner’s appeal against the conviction and sentence and affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court. 
 
 
• The petitioner now seeks special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 8 March 2018 dismissing the petitioner’s appeal and affirming his conviction and sentence.
 
 
• Before dealing with the petitioner’s application for special leave I would like to outline the summary of facts in this case as follows.
 

Facts in Brief
 
  
• The victim in this case had been 7 years old at the time of the incident. The petitioner is her father’s brother who was living with the victim’s family. On the day of incident as usual she had gone to school and after the school was over the petitioner is alleged to have picked her up at a certain point and taken to the kitchen of another nearby house where no one was present. In the kitchen he is said to have committed all four acts set out in separate counts. A neighbouring boy called John Davis had seen, through the window , the petitioner getting the victim to suck his penis inside the kitchen and he had alerted his mother . 
 
 
•  It is relevant to state at this stage that the petitioner in his caution interview at page 103 of the Supreme Court case record has admitted commission of all three acts of rape and one sexual assault on the victim. After a voir dire trial the caution interview was held to be admissible in evidence. 
 

Agreed facts
 
  
• It is useful to consider the agreed facts in this case as parties at the trial court have reached a consensus with regard to the relationship of the petitioner and the victim-child who was 7 years old at the time of the incident.

At page 81 of the High Court record the State counsel and the defence counsel on behalf of the parties have reached the following agreed facts:
 
  
•  It is agreed that the accused is Mohammed Alfaaz. The accused is a hairdresser by profession.

2. It is agreed that the complainant is AN.
  
•  It is agreed that the complainant and the accused are related. The accused is the uncle of the complainant.
 
•  It is agreed that the accused resides with the family of the complainant at Sabeto, Nadi.
 

The agreed facts establishes the identity of the accused ( petitioner) and the identification was not an issue at the trial in this case as the complainant when testifying identified the petitioner as the person who raped her and the petitioner was residing in the same house with the same family. The petitioner was well known to the victim as her uncle.
 
 
Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 
 
  
•  The Supreme Court derives exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all judgments of the Court of Appeal under section 98 (3) (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. Section 98 (4) of the Republican Constitution of Fiji also provides that an appeal may be brought to the Supreme Court from a final Judgment of the Court of Appeal unless the Supreme Court grants leave to appeal.
 
 
• Section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act No. 14 of 1998 sets out the stringent criteria for grant of special leave which is as follows:
 

“In relation to a criminal matter, the Supreme Court must not grant special leave to appeal unless-
 
A question of general legal importance is involved;
 
A substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved; or
 Substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur.” 
 
  
• It is manifest from the above provisions contained in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act of 1998 special leave should not be granted as a matter of course.
 
 
• In Aminiasi Katonivualiku v State (2003) FJSC Crim. App. No.CAV 0001/1999s 17th April 2003 clarified the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court at page 3 as follows:
 

“It is plain from this provision that the Supreme court is not a Court of criminal appeal or general review nor is there an appeal to the court as a matter of right and whilst we accept in an application for special leave some elaboration on the grounds of appeal may have to be entertained , the Court is necessarily confined within the legal parameters set out above, to an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal which in this instance , was an order for new trial. 
 
  
• In Dip Chand v State CAV0014/2012 the Supreme Court observed as follows:
 

“ Given that the criteria set out in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act No. 14 of 1998 are extremely stringent and special leave is not granted as a matter of course, the fact that the majority of the grounds relied on by the petitioner for special leave to appeal have not been raised in the Court of Appeal makes the task of the petitioner of crossing the threshold requirements for special leave even more difficult.”
 
  
• Time and again the Supreme Court in Fiji has pronounced in a series of Judgments that it is an extremely difficult task for a petitioner to pass the stringent threshold criteria contained in section 7 (2) of the Supreme  Court Act No. 14 of 2014. The petitioner has a greater burden to establish his ground of appeal as a ‘question of general legal significance and that there is substantial and grave injustice’ that warrants leave from the Supreme Court. 
 
 
• In the recent judgment in Sharma v State [2017] FJSC 5; CAV0031.2016 the Supreme Court on threshold requirements in section 7 (2) of the Supreme  Court Act of 1998 observed as follows:
 

“It is observed that the injustice that is said to have occurred must not only be one that is substantial but also one that is grave. As such, even if the party succeeds in establishing that some injustice had been caused , that by itself may not be sufficient to obtain relief unless the party is capable of establishing that the injustice referred to is one that meets the threshold laid down in section 7 (2) paragraph (c) of the Supreme Court Act.” 
 
  
• The Supreme Court went on further and observed:
 

“The Supreme Court in Fiji is not a court in which decisions of the Court of Appeal will be routinely reviewed. The requirement for special leave is to be taken seriously. It will not be granted lightly. Too low a standard for its grant undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal and distract this court from its role as the final appellate body by burdening it with appeals that do not give rise to matters of general importance or principles or in the criminal jurisdiction ,substantial and grave injustice.
 
  
• I agree with the learned State Counsel who referred to this judgment in the written submissions of the respondent as the petitioner has a difficult task to establish that substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur if special leave is not granted.
 
 
• Now I would deal with the grounds of appeal urged by the petitioner in the Supreme Court. In the amended petition of appeal dated 31st July 2018 filed by the petitioner, the grounds of appeal in the Supreme Court has been restricted to only two grounds against the conviction and one ground of appeal against the sentence which are as follows:
 

 Grounds of Appeal against Conviction
 
 (i) The learned Judge had erred in not directing the assessors on the medical report.
 (ii) The learned Judge in not adequately directing the assessors on the circumstantial evidence.
 

 Ground of appeal against the sentence
 
 The appellant was punished twice by the trial Judge for the same evidence.
 
  
•  When the petitioner’s application was taken up for hearing on 16th August 2018 the petitioner was represented by a counsel from the Legal Aid Commission. The learned counsel submitted that the medical report tendered in evidence at the trial does not show any evidence in regard to the 3rd count on anal penetration. The findings of the doctor who medically examined is only in relation to the vaginal area and his submission that the learned Judge failed to adequately direct the assessors on the absence of any findings of anal penetration constituted a substantial and grave error. 
 
 
• It is relevant at this stage to state that at the hearing of this appeal on 16th August 2018 when the court questioned the learned counsel for the petitioner as to whether at the end of summing up by the learned trial Judge the opportunity was afforded to the petitioner for redirection if there was a non-direction on the question of insufficient evidence of the medical report about the 3rd count. The reply by the Counsel was “no”. The court pointed out and drew the attention of the Counsel to the last paragraph 74 of the summing up of the Judge at page 49 of the summing up dated 30 January 2014 wherein it is stated that “any redirections” ? Learned counsel finally agreed with the court’s observation. It is obviously clear from the case record that the invitation was afforded to the petitioner to ask for redirection but the petitioner did not seek to utilize it. It appears from the failure of the petitioner not to seek redirection when the opportunity was afforded by court, that the petitioner has done this deliberately to find an appeal point. 
 
 
• In Varasiko Tuwai v State [2016] FJSC 35, 26 August 2016; the Supreme Court made the following observation.

“ Before I go any further I must say that the trial Judge had asked the parties if they needed any re-directions in the matter. The parties did not seek any re-directions on the grounds they alleged that the directions were inadequate. Was this done for a deliberate reason to find a ground of appeal? If that is so, the appellate courts approach must be stringent.
 
Litigants must not wait for trial judges to make mistakes to find a point of appeal The transparent nature of litigation requires that the trial judge be given an opportunity to correct any errors made. If the trial judge has asked the parties to seek re-directions an they do not and subsequently raise the issue in the appellate Court then in the absence of any cogent reason, it should be held against that party as having employed a deliberate tactic to find an appeal point.” 
 
  
• The Court of Appeal in dealing with this ground of appeal observed in Paragraph 42 of the judgment as follows:

“The supreme Court and this court on more than one occasion had commented on constant complaints on alleged non-directions and misdirection. Knowing that I am being repetitive it is nevertheless apt once again to quote from Raj v State Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No. CAV 0003 of 2014: 20 August 2014 [2014] FJSC 12 where the Supreme Court said
 
“At trial the defence counsel could have raised with the judge the proper direction to the assessors....
 
‘The raising of direction matters in this way is a useful function and in following it , counsel assist in achieving a fair trial. In doing so they act in their client’s interest. The appellate courts will not look favourably on cases where counsel have held their seats, hoping for an appeal point when issues in directions should have been raised with the judge. We do not believe this was intended in this case.”
 
  
•  It is important to address our minds carefully when there is a ground of appeal on misdirection or non-direction alleging that the learned trial judge has erred by failing to direct the assessors adequately on non-direction and the appellate courts must not approach the issue leniently if the opportunity had been afforded to the petitioner for re-direction at the end of summing up and if they did not seek re-direction.
 
 
•  In the present case the petitioner was asked by the trial Judge whether he sought any redirection ( Para 74 of the summing up High Court record) (supra) at the end of the summing up it appears from the record that there was no reply given by the petitioner. This omission is in itself sufficient to disregard this ground of appeal in this court.( Segran Murti v The State; Crim. App. No. CAV0016/2008s 12th February 2009.)
 
 
•  The doctor who testified in this case for the prosecution was one with 20 years experience. She was not the doctor who examined the victim. She said in her evidence that according to the medical report ( P 3) that the hymen extended and wide open and was not intact. The professional opinion confirmed sexual assault on the victim either through penile penetration or fingering. The doctor further said under cross-examination by the defence counsel that there would have been a swelling in the vaginal area if there was penile penetration. But that it will depend on the time of examination after the incident as it could have been healed. She also testified and said that medical findings are consistent with the history. The evidence of the medical report at page 106 (P3) of the High Court Record shows that the victim had been examined by the doctor on 19. 9 2012 two days after the incident on 17. 9.2012. 
 

Second ground of appeal against conviction on circumstantial evidence.
 
  
• The petitioner alleged that the learned trial Judge erred in not adequately directing the assessors on the circumstantial evidence at the trial. Before I deal with this ground of appeal it is relevant to consider the petitioner’s caution interview statement dated 20 September 2012 at page 103 of the High Court record. The caution interview statement has been admitted in evidence at the trial.
 
 
•  The prosecution case in the trial court was that the petitioner had sexually assaulted and raped the victim of 7 years old who was the niece of the petitioner. In the caution interview the petitioner admitted the commission of all unlawful acts referred to in all four counts against him. The petitioner’s admission of the commission of sexual assault and rape of the victim contained in the caution interview is as follows:

“Q 13: where were you on Monday 17/9/12 at about 4 p.m.
 
A: I came home at 11 a.m. and when it was the time for school children to come home then I went towards the road and was waiting at my uncle’s house.
 
Q 14: Then what happened ? 
 
A : I was at my uncle’s house standing between the kitchen and the house as the space is there. When I saw P I called her and she came to me.
 
Q15: Then what happened?
 
A : When P came to me I hold her and took her into the kitchen. I then left her lie on the table , pulled her pants and panty and inserted my tongue in her vagina and started licking it.
 
Q 16: The what happened 
 
A : After licking her vagina then I inserted my erected penis into her vagina and started pushing in and out.
 
 Q 17: Then what happened ?
 
A: After some time I told her to turn around and then I inserted my penis inside her anus and started pushing in and out When I inserted my penis into her anus she cried but I still kept on doing it and after some time I told her to get up.
 
Q 18: Then what happened ?
 
A : Then I let her suck my penis .I was letting her suck my penis when one Fijian boy saw us and I quickly pulled the clothes of P and told her not tell anyone and left from there.
 
Q 19: Can you saw me the place you had sexual intercourse with Arasida ? 
 
A: yes.
 
It is important to state that the caution interview evidence after it has been admitted in evidence at a voir dire trial regarding its voluntariness conducted by High Court is not circumstantial evidence. 
 
  
• The petitioner’s complaint is that the second ground of appeal against conviction relates to count 4 in the Information and the Court of Appeal considered that there was no evidence brought out from the complainant when she testified in court on the 4th count on rape. However, Court nonetheless, found that the evidence of John Davis who was an independent witness was sufficient to convict the petitioner .

I would like to reproduce the observations of the Court of Appeal when it considered that evidence in paragraph 29 of the Judgment. 
 
 Para 29 of the judgment:
 
“Therefore, there is clear evidence by the victim that the appellant had committed the offences set out in the first three counts. I agree that the victim’s evidence has not touched on the allegation set out in count 4. i.e. penetration of her mouth. But the evidence on that count is amply provided by John Davis whose evidence remained intact even after cross-examination.”
 
  
• It is to be noted that petitioner’s caution interview evidence provided sufficient evidence to corroborate the victim’s evidence and John Davis’s evidence on all four counts against the petitioner. Furthermore it can be seen from the child-victim’s evidence that that evidence supports the evidence of John Davis. John Davis in his testimony at page 141 of the High Court record, said that ‘They were in the kitchen. It was Munar’s kitchen. This is after school’s over. At first time I was standing about 25 feet He was not wearing any T-shirt. The girl was wearing her school uniform...”
 
 
•  The question that the petitioner has raised on this ground appeal is that from the victim’s evidence she does not speak of the allegation in respect of the anal penetration as charged in the fourth count. It is to be noted that both the single Judge and the Full Court of Appeal were in agreement that John Davis’s evidence was not circumstantial but direct evidence. John Davis was an eye-witness to the incident in relation to count four. This piece of evidence of John was very powerful and convincing for the prosecution. The petitioner, however, in his written submissions at paragraph 7.3 has conceded that John Davis’s evidence is direct evidence and not circumstantial evidence.

I would reproduce what the single Judge of the Court of Appeal and Full Court observed in regard to John Davis’s evidence in the trial court.
 
In Paragraph 10 of the Ruling of the single Judge dated 12 august 2016 it is stated that “ ....in a trial where the prosecution relied on direct evidence as was in this case and where that direct evidence is sufficient for the learned Judge to convict , then the failure to direct on the circumstantial evidence that may have been adduced , does not constitute a miscarriage of justice. (emphasis is mine)
 
 The paragraph 44 of the Court of Appeal Judgment refers to the complaint on circumstantial evidence by the petitioner and observed that;
 
“ .......However, John’s evidence is eye-witness’ evidence and not a piece of circumstantial evidence. He had given direct evidence on seeing the Appellant getting the victim to suck his penis. It is true that the victim had not spoken to that act in her evidence. However, the trial Judge had placed the evidence of both the victim and John before the assessors who seemed to have believed and acted upon John’s evidence in relation to the 4th count....” 
 
  
• At page 144 of the High Court record the victim had testified as follows:
 

 “Q 31: This bad thing painful: yes.
 
Q 36: Who removed sutana: Alfaaz
 
Q 38: This bad thing was done was it done by any part of Alfaaz’s body: Tongue.
 
Q39: Where did his use his tongue : down.
 
Q40: did he use another part of his body. Down
 
Q41: What you mean by down: Panu: ( penis)
 Q 42: Where did Alfaaz use his panu: down.
 
Q 43: What is down: pussy vagina.
 
Q44: Did Alfaaz use panu anywhere else : Bump ( backside) 
 Q45: Did Alfaaz use his panu anywhere else: no.
 Q46: After Alfaaz did this thing did he tell you anything: yes not to tell anyone..
 
 
Under cross-examination 
 Q 47: I put it to you Alfaaz never put his penis into your vagina.: he did.
 
 Q 49: I put it to you Alfaaz never put his tongue into your vagina. He did lick my vagina.
Q50: I put it to you Alfaaz never put his penis at your backside: He did that.
Q 52: I put it to you It was not Mr Alfaaz who raped you ? He did that. 
 
The above evidence of the victim is supported by the caution interview evidence of the petitioner. There is no apparent reason for the child-victim to have falsely implicated the petitioner for having committed sexual assault and rape on her.
 
  
• In Rajinder Raju v State of H.P. Crim. App.No. 670 of 2003 decided on 07.07.2009, R.M.Lodha J while speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of India said as follows:

“ A woman victim of sexual aggression would rather suffer silently than to falsely implicate somebody .Any statement of rape is an extremely humiliating experience for a woman...; she would not blame anyone but the real culprit. While appreciating the evidence of the prosecutrix, the courts must always keep in mind that no self-respecting woman would put her honour at stake by falsely alleging commission of rape on her.” 
 
  
• It appears from the caution interview evidence the petitioner refers to a Fijian boy who saw petitioner and identified him as Alfaaz in the kitchen and that Fijian boy was John Davis who testified in court for the prosecution. And therefore the evidence of the caution interview of the petitioner, the evidence of child-victim and John Davis’s evidence were sufficient and strong evidence to convict the petitioner of all four counts as charged. In Kean v State Crim. App. No. AAU 95 of 2008: 13 November 2013 [2013] FJCA 117 the court observed that in Fiji, under section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009, a trial Judge is no longer required to give a standard warning to the assessors where the evidence of a complainant in a trial for an offence of a sexual nature is not corroborated . The Supreme Court of India in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat (1983) AIR 753, 1983 SCR (3) 280 observed that “ Corroboration is not a sine qua non for a conviction in a rape case.” 
 
 
• In Hassan v Reginam; Criminal App. No. 57 of 1997: 28 July 1978 [1978] FJCA 18 made the following observation.

“ It is well established law that man may be convicted , even of murder, solely upon his confession. R v Sykes [1913] 8 Crim. App. P 233. McKay v The King (1935) 54 CLR 1. It has been stated in this court that it is customary to look for some evidence of surrounding circumstances which are consistent with the confession. Such evidence need not be corroboration in the strict sense of the term, but merely evidence of facts which are not inconsistent with those set out in the confessional statements (emphasis added).
 
  
•  I would now refer to a subsequently decided case in Khan v State; Crim. App. No. AAU 0069 of 2007 wherein a similar view was expressed and observed that :
 

“ It is well established law that the accused may be convicted of any crime upon his own confession alone.” 
 
  
•  In the backdrop of the legal position stated above and having considered the evidence of the victim, John Davis and caution interview of the petitioner and the medical evidence I find that the unanimous opinion of the assessors and the trial Judge’s judgment in convicting the petitioner of all four counts is reasonable and correct in law. 
 
• In view of the above there is no reason for disturbing the decision of the Court of Appeal. I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appeal of the petitioner against conviction. This ground of appeal has no merit and should fail. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.
 

Ground of Appeal against the Sentence
 
  
• The petitioner’s next complaint is that the petitioner was punished twice by the trial Judge when sentencing him .The petitioner alleges that the Court Appeal in its judgment at paragraph 51 found that the trial Judge had fallen into error in double counting the aggravating factors but nonetheless court found that the sentence imposed on the petitioner to be justifiable. He also complains that the Court of Appeal could have looked into the rehabilitation aspect when sentencing. 
 
 
• It is pertinent to state at the outset of dealing with this ground of appeal against the sentence that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him by the trial Judge was manifestly excessive or wrong. The petitioner was sentenced to 13 years 7 months and 15 days imprisonment by the High Court with a non -parole period of 12 years.
 
 
•  The learned trial Judge has considered the mitigating factors on petitioner’s age and that he was a first offender and the petitioner earned one year discount from the total sentence of 16 years. The period the petitioner spent in remand was also deducted.
 
 
•  It is necessary to state briefly that this is a case where the victim was 7 years old at the time of the incident. The victim was the petitioner’s elder brother’s daughter. On 17th September 2012 the petitioner lured the victim who was returning home from the school into a kitchen in a nearby house . At that place the petitioner sexually abused and raped her. The petitioner was found guilty of all four counts as charged by a unanimous decision of the assessors and was convicted accordingly. 
 
 
•  According to the Crimes Decree ( Act) 2009 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment in Fiji. The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years. The petitioner was sentenced to 13 years 7 months and 15 days each in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 and he was sentenced to 8 years for count one.
 
 
•  The tariff for rape of an adult is 7 years to 10 years imprisonment. In Mohamed Kasim v State; [1994] FJCA 25; AAU 00221J.93 (27 May 1994)

In this case the Court of Appeal observed that “ we consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime more clearly reflect understandable public outrage. We must stress however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that here are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.”
 
  
•  In Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12 Crim. App. CAV0003 of 2014, 20 August 2014. The Supreme Court observed that 
 

“Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault... Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children... Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.” In paragraph 58 of the Judgment The Judge has correctly identified the tariff for rape of a child as between 10- 16 years imprisonment.
 
  
•  The petitioner in this case complains that when adding aggravating factors the High Court Judge fell into error of ‘double counting’. The Court of Appeal in paragraph 51 has agreed with the submission of the petitioner that the trial Judge appears to have fallen into error. The Court of Appeal observed that though there was an error on the part of the trial Judge for double counting nonetheless the court found the totality of sentences imposed on the petitioner to be justifiable on the basis of the gravity and brutality of the offences and was well within the tariff. 
 
 
•  The Court of Appeal considered carefully whether the errors committed by the trial Judge in arriving at the sentence should disturb the ultimate sentences by referring to the relevant observations made by the Supreme Court in Koroicakavu v The State; Crim. App.CAV0006U ,2005S 04 May 2006 [2006] FJSC 5 wherein the Court said that :

“This argument misunderstands the sentencing process. It is not a mathematical exercise. It is an exercise of judgment involving the difficult and inexact task of weighing both aggravating and mitigating circumstances concerning the offending, and recognizing that the so-called starting point is itself no more than an inexact guide. Inevitably different judges and Magistrates will assess the circumstances somewhat differently in arriving at a sentence. It is the ultimate sentence that is of importance, rather than each step in the reasoning process leading to it. When a sentence is reviewed on appeal , again it is ultimate sentence rather than each step in the reasoning process that must be considered. Different judges may start from slightly different starting points and give somewhat different weight to particular facts of aggravation and mitigation, yet still arrive at or close to the same sentence. That is what has occurred here , and no error is disclosed in either the original sentencing or appeal process” (emphasis added).
 
The answer to the issue on errors by the trial Judge if any, is given in the above case. It is finally the ultimate sentence that is material and not the step in the reasoning process. 
 
  
•  It is useful to refer to the observations expressed by the Fiji Court of Appeal in Matasavui v State; Crim. App. No. AAU 0036 of 2013: 30 September [2016] FJCA 118 wherein court said that “ No society can afford to tolerate an innermost feeling among the people that offenders of sexual offenders of sexual crimes committed against mothers, daughters and sisters are not adequately punished by courts and such a society will not in the long run be able to sustain itself as a civilized entity.” The Court of Appeal referred to the same judgment in paragraph 60 of the judgment which is being canvassed before this court having taken into consideration the gravity and cruelty of the case before court and observed that highest possible punishment should be given to the prospective offenders of sexual assault on children who are vulnerable to fall prey to the offenders. I agree with the observations expressed by the Court of Appeal in this regard and would not hesitate to add further that the Court of Appeal had been lenient not to enhance the sentences on the petitioner in view of the aggravating factors in this case. 
 
 
•  It is very useful to refer to the judgment of Madigan J in State v Mario Tauvoli High Court of Fiji at Lautoka Crim Case No. HAC 027 of 2011 decided on 18 April 2011 wherein the court said “ Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society’s abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation’s children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.”

The Court further went on to observe that in paragraph 6 “ It is now well settled that sentences for rape of children should be within the range of ten to fifteen years. This court in State v M.D. ( HAC 129 of 2010 L) took a starting point of 15 years for a stepfather who raped his 13 year old stepdaughter.” 
 
  
•  The learned High Court Judge in that case took a term of 12 years as his starting point for the offence of rape. In that case the accused was the stepfather who was in a position of trust in the care and protection of the child and had breached the trust. The victim was the stepdaughter who was 14 years old. Therefore the Judge had added four years as aggravating factors. The facts of the above case of Mario Tauvoli (supra) were similar to the present case before this court. 
 
 
•  The learned State Counsel submitted that rehabilitation was one of the key considerations in sentencing but it has to be weighed against the other circumstances that are present in the case. In the present case the petitioner was a grown adult with responsibilities to look after the child victim who was in his custody when returning from the school. She was in his care and protection. The petitioner forcefully took her to a kitchen in a nearby house and abused and raped her committing several unlawful and immoral sexual acts knowing that the child-victim was of tender years. At the time of committing the sexual acts the victim cried out but the petitioner continued to keep on committing the offence plundering the victim’s very childhood.
 
 
• The State counsel further submitted that rape and sexual statistics of Fiji disclose equally worrying social malaise and further submitted that the statistics released by the Director Of Public Prosecutions reveals that, between January and July 2018, out of 123 cases of rape and sexual violence filed in 78 cases the victims were children and out of 78 cases 26 victims were aged 10 years and below. State counsel further submitted that the sentence of 13 years 7 months and 15 days is commensurate with the serious offence he committed and moved for dismissal of the petitioner’s appeal. I agree with her submission that the sentence of 13 years 7 months and 15 days is commensurate with the serious offence of rape the petitioner committed.
 
 
•  It is relevant at this juncture to refer to the observations expressed by his Lordship the Chief Justice Anthony Gates in Ram v State; [2015] FJSC 26; CAV12.2015 (23 October 2015)

“The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the Courts have recently been handing down very heavy sentences on offenders against children. Sexual offending against children in this country has become far too prevalent and it is the hope that harsh sentences will send out a clear message to would be perpetrators that our children are to be protected from such unrestrained immorality.”
 
  
• According to the statistics released by the Director of Public prosecutions Office it appears that a number of rape victims as well as victims under the age of 18 years and victims in domestic relationships or relatives were also victims of other serious sexual offences. The rape of children is a very serious offence and it is very frequent and prevalent in Fiji. The courts must impose harsh penalties dictated by the legislation. The courts should not leniently look at this kind of serious cases of rape of children of tender years when punishing the offenders.
 
 
• In view of the seriousness, gravity and cruelty involved in this case when committing the offence of rape of the victim-child of 7 years the sentence imposed by the High Court is justifiable and commensurate with the offence. In fact the petitioner is fortunate that he was not sentenced to a more harsh term of imprisonment in terms of sentencing practice of our courts. 
 
 
• We do not find any reasons to observe that the Court of Appeal has fallen into error when it reached its conclusion to dismiss the petitioner’s appeal. 
 

Conclusion 
 
  
•  In the backdrop of the legal position stated above it is clear that the petitioner has not been able to establish any ground of appeal before this court. The prosecution in the trial court relied not only on the caution interview statement of the petitioner but also on the victim’s evidence, John Davis’s evidence and medical evidence. Therefore the petitioner’s application for leave should fail. The petitioner has failed to satisfy any of the threshold criteria enumerated in section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act of 1998.
 
 
• Therefore for the reasons set out above, the petitioner’s application for leave to appeal should be refused and We dismiss the said application.
 

65. Orders of the Court:
 
 
 (1) The petitioner’s application for leave to appeal is refused.
 (2) The Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 8th March 2018 is affirmed.

70302,"SENTENCE

[1] On the 4th November 2010, in the Magistrates Court at Lautoka, this accused entered a plea of guilty to two charges as follows: 

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

ACT INTENDED TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 255(b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

Particulars of Offence

AJAY CHAND s/o Abhay Chand on the 26th day of October 2010 at Lautoka in the Western Division, with intent to do grievous harm to PUSPA ANJALI NAICKER d/o Sanmogam Naicker unlawfully stuck (sic) PUSPA ANJALI NAICKER d/o Sanmogam Naicker with a pinch bar. 

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

DAMAGING PROPERTY: Contrary to section 361(1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
Particulars of Offence

AJAY CHAND s/o Abhay Chand 26th day of October 2010 at Lautoka in the Western Division, willfully and unlawfully damaged 2 wall mirrors valued at $4,500.00 the property of PUSPA ANJALI NAICKER d/o Sanmogam Naicker.
[2] Having convicted the accused on both charges, the Magistrate transferred the matter to this Court for sentence, pursuant to section 194(a) of the Criminal Procedure Decree.

FACTS

[3] The convict and Miss P.N. had been living in a de facto relationship for 2 years when in June 2010 Miss P.N. moved out of the domestic home and moved into a rental flat with one Fijian lady. She continued her relationship with the convict. Miss P.N. worked as the proprietress of a hair salon.

[4] On the 26th October 2010 this accused went to the salon and waiting until all customers had left, he closed the door and demanded of Miss P.N. why she was seeing another man and he started to beat her with a pinch bar. Apart from beating Miss P.N. he damaged the wall mirror inside the salon with the pinch bar.

[5] Miss P.N. yelled for help when upon passers-by intervened and the accused was arrested and Miss P.N. was rushed to hospital.

[6] The accused was interviewed under caution when he told the Police that the previous evening he had been watching the ladies' flat and had become suspicious of persons he had seen there. It was then that he formulated the plan to take matters in hand the following day.

[7] The accused had on 20th October been made subject to a Domestic Violence restraining order, however he was not charged with breach of this order, by committing these offences.

[8] Miss P.N. was medically examined and found to have quite serious injuries including cut wounds to her eyebrow and lower legs and multiple haematomae on the face, shoulder and legs.

[9] The accused tells me he is 35 years old, that he works as a building contractor and has been educated to Class 7 level. He expresses sincere remorse, and tells me he will try to reconcile with Miss P.N. if she is willing.

[10] The Domestic Violence Decree 2009 is applicable to all parties who are, or have been, in a domestic relationship and the Decree quite obviously is germane in this case. I regard the breach of a prior restraining order against this accused as a very serious matter indeed.

[11] When a relationship sours, it is the right of each party to lead his/her life unfettered by any influence of the other party. Whether Miss P.N. was entertaining a new suitor, or whether this was merely a misconception on the part of the accused does not matter. It must be a basic human right to consort lawfully with whomever one wants to, and not to be prey to the resentful whim of a spurned partner.

[12] The maximum penalty for the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is imprisonment for life. This is an offence relatively new to the jurisdiction, introduced by the Crimes Decree 2009 on February 1st, 2010. Until a body of sentencing authorities is secured, it is helpful to rely on the analogous section 224 of the old Penal Code, the offence of an act intended to cause grievous harm. It was established in Viliame Cavubati – HAA 80 of 2001 by Shameem J. that the accepted tariff for this offence should range from a suspended sentence through to 2 ½ years. This Court said in Amasi Korovata – HAC 11 of 2009 that the range now should extend up to 4 to 5 years.

[13] This offence was particularly repugnant in that the victim was the accused's long time girl friend and that the attack was vicious and in her place of work. I take as a starting point a term of two years imprisonment. The aggravating features to be considered are:

(i) there was no provocation on the part of the victim;
(ii) she was unarmed;
(iii) the attack was on the victim's workplace where she had an expectation to be safe.

For these features I add another two years to the sentence bringing it to a total of 4 years.

[14] Although the accused was not charged with a breach of domestic violence restraining order, he has admitted before me that he in fact did so, which I regard as another aggravating feature. For that breach I add a further 12 months imprisonment bringing the interim total term to 5 years.

[15] Of course the greatest item of mitigation in the accused's favour is his plea of guilty and he is to have full credit for this. I deduct from his sentence a full third of 20 months for that plea. I deduct a further period of 4 months for his remorse which means that this accused will serve a total term for the unlawful act of three years. He will serve two years of that term before being eligible for parole.

[16] For the offence of damaging property, I sentence the accused to a term of 9 months to be served concurrently with the unlawful act sentence.

[17] In view of the imminent term of incarceration, any order under the Domestic Violence Decree would be superfluous and I therefore decline to make such order.

74983,"Sentence

[1] The accused, juvenile was charged for following offences; 

First Count:

Sexual Assault: Contrary to section 210(1)(a) of the Crimes Decree no: 44 of 2009. 

Second Count:

Rape: Contrary to section 270(1)(2) (a) of the Crimes Decree no: 44 of 2009. 

[2] The Case was remitted under extended jurisdiction. The Accused pleaded guilty at first instance. The juvenile has been found guilty for these counts on his own plea.

[3] The facts of the case are reproduced as follows; On the 21st of December 2011 after 2pm Taniela Drose (hereinafter referred to as ""the juvenile"") carried the complainant (her sister) from their sitting room when she was asleep. The complainant screamed when the juvenile was carrying her, the juvenile then tried closing her mouth with his right hand, when the complainant struggled to get away, the juvenile kept pulling her to him and tied her hands. The juvenile made the complainant stand beside the bathroom wall – the complainant then saw the juvenile putting his hand inside her panty and rubbing her vagina whilst his other hand held his penis. The incident was witnessed by their grandmother. On the 24th of December 2011, the complainant was asleep in the sitting room with her mother and younger brother when the juvenile came inside the sitting room. The juvenile then started fondling the complainant's breast and began touching her body, whilst touching her body; the juvenile removed the complainant's shorts and panty – the juvenile then place his hands on the complainants mouth when she wanted to scream. The juvenile pulled out his penis and inserted it inside the complainants vagina, the juvenile utter words 'I will rape you' whilst committing the act on the complainant. The complainant struggled and managed to 'kick off' the juvenile then ran to the toilet, the juvenile followed suit and pushed open the toilet door, entered inside the toilet and pulled out his penis and inserted it into the complainants vagina – the complainant felt pain when the juvenile was committing this act on her. The complainant was medically examined on the 24th of December 2012 by Dr. Evelyn Tuivaga, medical findings suggest that thy hymen is intact, and ½ (half) centimeter bruising, on both lateral walls of the vagina (outer surface) specifically indentifying that there was sexual abuse.

[4] Tariff for the sexual assault yet to be established. But in CRIMINAL CASE NO. HAC 075 OF 2010S STATE vs SAULA TUWAI His Lordship Justice Temo imposed 4 years imprisonment for sexual assault. 

[5] The tariff for rape of a child is between 10 - 14 years imprisonment. (Mark Lawrence Mutch v. State Crim.App. No. AAU 0060 1999; Mani v. State, Crim.App.HAA 0053.02L; State v. Saitava, Crim.Case No. HAC 10/07, State v. Tony Cr. App. No. HAA 003/08). 

[6] The Accused is 15 years old at the time of the incident. In Section 30 of the Juvenile Act prescribes a maximum sentence of 2 years irrespective the gravity of offence. 

[7] The aggravating factors are; 

(i) The victim regarded is the juvenile's sister.

(ii) It is this relationship of trust that is the strongest aggravating factor against the accused.

(iii) The juvenile is regarded by the victim as her big brother, in raping and sexual assault offence on her, the accused person took advantage of the trust that the victim had placed on him.

(iv) Moreover his actions demonstrate a complete disregard of the clearly defined societal, religious and traditional rules that prohibit sexual relations between brothers and sisters.

(v) the accused person took advantage of the victim's naivety and trust when he committed these offending having no regard to the long term effects that his actions might have on her.
[8] The mitigating factors are;

	A.	The juvenile is 16 years of age.

	B.	He is currently in remand at the Boys Center.

	I.	He was overcome with lust and sexual curiosity as he had watched some pornographic movies, which led to commit these offences.

	A.	The juvenile was brought up in a broken family. His father passed away from cancer when the juvenile was a toddler and so he never had the opportunity to know his father nor know that the fathers love would feel like.

	B.	He wishes to ask for forgiveness from his family especially his sister (complainant) for his actions. He acknowledges and understands that he had committed a very grave wrong. He also acknowledges that his actions have caused major negative impacts on his sisters life and future and for that, he is really sorry.

[9] The Juvenile Act of Cap 56 Section 32 clearly states the manner to which a Court may deal with a juvenile once the Court is satisfied of the finding of guilt of the juvenile, which state as follows:

""32. (1) Where a juvenile is tried for an offence and the Court is satisfied of his guilt, the Court shall take into consideration the manner in which, under the provisions of this or any other written law, the case should be dealt with, namely""

(a) By discharging the offender under Section 44 of the Penal Code;

(b) By ordering the offender to pay a fine, compensation or costs;

(c) By ordering the parent or guardian of an offender to pay a fine, compensation or costs;

(d) By ordering the parent or guardian of the offender to give security for the good behavior of the offender;

(e) By making a care order in respect of the offender;

(f) By making a probation order in respect of the offender;

(g) Where the offender is a young person, by ordering him to be imprisoned;

(h) By dealing with the case in any other lawful manner"".
[10] I consider the objectives of Sentencing and Penalty Decree. We further refer to Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree which states;

""As a general principle of sentencing, a Court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part"".

[11] In State v Mocevakaca [1990] FJHC 87; [1990] 36 FLR 19 (14 February 1990) Fatiaki J (As he then was) dealt with a rape case. His Lordship stressed on sentencing in young offenders said; 
""This court has said before and I say it again that our prisons are already too full of young Fijian men and the courts have a duty to try and reverse that trend wherever it is possible and just. In other words, every effort must be made to keep young first offenders out of prison even I might add at the risk of being lenient.

Needless to say, in the case of young first offenders there can rarely ever be any conflict between the general public interest and that of the offender.

If I may say so society has no greater interest than that its young people should became useful law-abiding citizens and the difficult task of the Courts is to determine what punishment or treatment gives the best chance of achieving that end. The realisation of that objective is the primary and by far the most important consideration in sentencing young first offenders."" (Emphasize is mine).

[12] In State v T.V.K. [2011] FJHC 732; HAC014.2011 (12 October 2011), Justice Thurairaja imposed for the juveniles in that case to be kept under probation until they reached 18 years of age, complete their education, Probation Officers to submit reports on the juveniles and counselling programs for the juveniles. This was done after the Court had considered the fact that a conviction will cause irreparable damage to their future. Both juveniles in that case were charged with Rape and Sexual Assault.

[13] The charges are serious, but law always allows juveniles to give second chance. The accused is almost 11 months at boys Centre. I am guided by the above case laws and principles of law and I also consider his propensity to do crimes again. I therefore act under section 44 (2) and (3) of the Sentencing and Penalty Decree and adjourn proceedings for next 3 years. The Accused's sentence is withheld. I further impose following conditions under sections 15(1) (g) and 44(3) of said Decree. 

A] The accused is bound over for sum of $ 1000 for next three years to observe peace and good behaviour. If the accused breach any condition, this bond or part of it may be forfeited. In default, accused be sentenced to the prison in appropriate penalty units. 

B] In addition to the above bond, the accused should not commit any offence whatsoever during this period. If you committed any offence or breached any condition you will be sentenced for this offence according to the law. Therefore you are conditionally discharged. 

C] The accused is ordered to report last Sunday of every month between 6am to 6pm to nearest Police Station during 1 year, last Sunday of every three months during 2 year and last Sunday of every six months during final year (Until expiration of next 3 years). Therefore, the accused is placed on police supervision and he should not change his permanent address during this period of time without leave of the court or DPP.

D] Further the accused is placed under nearest probation officer's supervision. The accused should report to the probation office forthwith. 

E] If the accused will comply above conditions, he will be discharged after 3 years under section 44(6) of the Sentencing and Penalty Decree 2009 without further punishment.

F] The accused must take this matter seriously; this is the final chance for his rehabilitation.

I] The Accused is placed on domestic violence standard non molestation order for lifetime, that he should not harass the victim, sexually, physically and mentally whatsoever under section 27 of the Domestic Violence Decree. 

[14] Copy of this sentence is given to the accused and the police and nature of sentence and police supervision is explained to the accused. Police are ordered to file report any breach of these condition forthwith (if any). At the expiry of three years the accused should file ""all clearance"" report from the police station and probation report from the probation office to terminate the proceedings, till then the proceeding is on. 

[15] 28 days to appeal.

82001,"SENTENCE

[1] On the 16th September 2010 this accused entered a plea of guilty in the Ba Magistrates Court to one offence of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17. The particulars state that on the 23rd May 2009 at Koronubu, Ba he had unlawful carnal knowledge of (a girl) without her consent.

[2] This plea was entered after a voir dire ruling that his cautioned interview be admitted into evidence, however most oddly, the accused had entered a plea of guilty on his very first appearance on 17th June 2009, a fact that appeared to have been overlooked by both the Magistrate and the prosecution at later appearances.

[3] The facts of the case which the accused admitted in the Court below reveals that on the 23rd May 2009 at about 5.00pm, the accused who is the victim's step father called her to work in the cassava patch 150 metres from their home. In the course of the work the accused took the victim farther away from the house to a dry creek bed. Beside that creek he removed her and his own clothes and proceeded to lick her breasts, stomach and vagina. He then penetrated her and ejaculated. As a result she was infected with a sexually transmitted disease and her genitals were injured. The accused confessed to Police in an interview under caution.

[4] The victim was 13 years old at the time and a school student in Class 7. She lived in the same house with the accused, her step father. The victim had been left in the care of the accused when her mother had gone to town to shop.

[5] The accused is 40 years of age, and works as a farmer. He appeared most remorseful and asks the Court for forgiveness. He says that he succumbed to temptation. He produced in Court a letter of reference from the head of the Tavua circuit of the Methodist Church, which letter sets out his family circumstances, including the poverty faced by the family if he is removed from them, and it also states that he has commenced training as a junior lay preacher, ""having devoted his life to the Lord Jesus Christ.""

[6] The State has filed concise but relevant submissions on sentence.

[7] Rape of children in Fiji is becoming far too prevalent. It is profoundly sad that girls of school age at an extremely vulnerable stage in their development should have to suffer the crushing indignity of this offence. As Goundar J. said in State v AV HAC 192 of 2008:

""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault...Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children...sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offence.""

Psychologists tell us that the emotional damage occasioned to child victims in sexual offences is immeasurable.

[8] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment, with the tariff for rape of a child being between ten and fifteen years. If rape of a child is not serious enough, the fact that she was your step daughter adds much to the severity of the offence. As a stepfather you have a role as her protector, role model and mentor. Instead you shattered that role in a small period of which you call ""temptation"". Your relationship will never be the same again, nor could you expect it to be, nor should you deserve to be restored to a parental role in the future.

[9] For this heinous crime, I take a starting point in sentence of fifteen years. For the highly aggravating circumstances in which you infected her with a sexually transmitted disease and caused injury to her vagina, I add to that term a further 3 years. You have powerful mitigation in your favour. You pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and you are obviously remorseful. You have spent less than 2 months in custody pending sentence. For these mitigatory factors I reduce your sentence to one of 12 years and that is the sentence of the Court. You will spend 10 years in custody before you are eligible for parole.

[10] It is to be noted that the names of the accused and that of the victim have been suppressed, in order that the victim may in anonymity be allowed to recover psychologically.

[11] You have 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

FOURTH COUNT
 
Representative Count
 
Statement of Offence
 
SEXUAL ASSAULT: contrary to section 210(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
PENI NAMARUA between the 1st day of January 2013 and 31st day of December 2014, at Tamavua in the Central Division, procured Mereoni Laufili without her consent, to witness an act of gross indecency by Peni Namarua.
 
  
• You have admitted the following summary of facts;
 

Summary of Facts:
 
The Accused:
 
Peni Namarua – 60 years of age, unemployed of Tamavua Village.
 
 
The Complainants:
 
(PW1) Peniasi Nateba – 5th November 2008, 9 years of age, class 3 student of Annesley Infant School of Tamavua Village.
 
(PW2) Mereoni Laufili – 12th October 2009, 8 years of age, class 2 student of Annesley Infant School of Tamavua Village.
 
  
• The accused and two complainants between 2013 and 2014 resided in the same area namely: Tamavua Village. The accused’s house was located just beside PW1’s residence.
 
• On an unknown date in 2013, the accused told PW1 and PW2 to come into his house and in the presence of PW2, the accused told PW1 to remove his clothes. The accused then inserted his erected penis into PW1’s anus which caused him considerable pain.
 
• PW2 was made to watch the accused carry out the abovementioned act on PW1.
 
• The accused after he had done the said act threatened PW1 not to inform anyone about what had happened, and as a result of such threat PW1 was in fear of the accused and did not relay the incident to anyone immediately after it happened.
 
• Apart from the incident in 2013, the accused on an unknown date in 2014, again inserted his erected penis into PW1’s anus.
 
• On another occasion in 2013, the accused told PW1 and PW2 to come into his house. Whilst inside the house, the accused told PW1 to touch his erected penis and after being told this PW1 touched the accused’s penis and massaged it in an upward-downward motion. PW1 did not consent to massaging the accused’s erected penis.
 
• Whilst the accused made PW1 do this, PW2 was made to watch. PW2 did not consent to watching PW1 massage the accused’s erected penis.
 
• The accused was interviewed under caution in the i-taukei language by DC4579 Josaia Soro on the 29th of November 2016 at the Samabula Police station CID office.
 
• The accused when questioned voluntarily admitted to calling PW1 into his house whereby he proceeded to undress PW1 by removing his pants. By this time the accused had already taken off his pants. He then told PW1 to touch his penis and further admitted that whilst PW1 lay down on the ground, he lay on top of him with both his knees on the floor.
 
• The accused admitted that he had called PW1 into his house because he had wanted to have intercourse with him. (Questions and Answers 49-58 and 67 of the said interview are relevant).
 
 
• The maximum sentence for the offence of rape under section 207(1) of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for life and the sentencing tariff for rape of a child is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014).
 
 
• The offence of sexual assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012), this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault.
 
 
• The four offences you are convicted of forms a series of offences of similar character. Therefore, in view of the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”), I consider it appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of the four offences. Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree reads thus;

“If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.”
 
  
• I select 12 years imprisonment as the starting point of your aggregate sentence.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors in this case; 
• There is a substantial age difference between you and the victims. You being an elder in the community have a responsibility to look after young children; and
 
• You exploited the vulnerability and naivety of the victims. 
 

 
• I consider the following as mitigating factors; 
• You are regarded as a first offender;
 
• You have pleaded guilty when the Information was first read over to you;
 
• You cooperated with the police; and
 
• You are remorseful.
 

 
• Your counsel had submitted the following inter alia as your personal circumstances; 
• You are 61 years old and a widower; and
 
• You are sickly, cannot walk without the aid of a walking stick.
 

 
• Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I increase your sentence by 05 years.
 
 
• Considering the mitigating factors other than the early guilty plea, I deduct 02 years. Now your sentence is 15 years imprisonment.
 
 
• In view of your early guilty plea, I deduct 05 years of your sentence.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to an imprisonment term of 10 years. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 07 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Act reads thus;

“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• I note that you were first produced before the magistrate court on 01/12/16 and since that date you have been in remand. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you pertaining to the sentence imposed on you in this case. I hold that a period of 09 months should be considered as served in terms of the provisions of section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Act.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 07 years. Considering the time spent in remand, the time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 09 years and 03 months
 
Non-parole period – 06 years and 03 months
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

MENI RAITEKITEKI on the 18th day of August 2015 at Nepani, Nasinu in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of PW, by penetrating her vagina with his penis without her consent.
 
 
THIRD COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
FALSE INFORMATION TO PUBLIC SERVANT: contrary to section 201(a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
MENI RAITEKITEKI on the 18th day of August 2015 at Nepani, Nasinu in the Central Division gave Detective Constable 4255 Binay Kumar, a person employed in the public service, a false name, intending to cause or knowing it to be likely that Detective Constable 4255 Binay Kumar will arrest Meni Raitekiteki if the true state of facts were known to him.
 
  
• You stand convicted of the first and the second counts after trial and of the third count upon you guilty plea.
 
 
• The brief facts are as follows. You went inside the 74-year-old victim’s house around midday on 18/08/15 when she was alone and watching TV. You were armed with a dagger. You punched the victim, dragged her on the floor and tied her hands with a belt. You then took two bottles of liquor, one Multimeter, assorted jewelries, cash and packets of biscuits, all to the value of around FJD 4900 that were under the possession and control of the victim. Then you made the victim lie down on two pillows you placed on the floor and you raped the victim whose hands were still tied with the belt. You then left the house with the property you took through the back door. You admitted that you gave a false name to the police when you were arrested. You were 20 years old when you committed the offences. 
 
 
• As a result of your punch to the victim’s face, her nasal bridge was broken. Due to the forceful penile penetration, the victim sustained a vaginal laceration which required to be surgically stitched. There was active bleeding from the victim’s vagina even at the time she was examined by the doctor. The doctor had also noted injuries on the victim’s wrists, on her back and a black eye.
 
 
• The crime you have committed on the 74-year-old victim is monstrous and dreadful. There is an unwritten obligation on the younger generation to look after the elders in the society. But, you being a 20 year-old, chose an elderly lady to be your prey, to rob her and rape her.
 
 
• The following convictions are noted in your previous conviction report;  
• 25/01/13 Burglary and theft
 
• 08/03/13 Burglary and theft
 
• 11/04/13 Burglary and theft
 
• 15/07/14 Burglary and theft
 
• 30/07/15 Burglary and theft
 

 
• In addition to the above, you were also convicted and sentenced on 03rd November 2015 for two burglary counts and two theft counts in relation to two incidents.
 
 
• Considering the aforementioned previous convictions, I am inclined to hold that you are a threat to the community. Therefore, I declare that you are a habitual offender in terms of section 11 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• Though you are a young offender, the nature of the crime you committed in this case and the fact that this court has determined that you are a habitual offender given your previous convictions, compels this court to regard the protection of the community from you as the principle purpose of the sentence imposed in this case.
 
 
• Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), reads thus;

“If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.”
 
  
• The above provisions allows a sentencing court to impose an aggregate sentence considering the totality of the offending when sentencing an offender for more than one offence founded on the same facts or which forms a series of offences of the same or similar character. The two offences, aggravated robbery and rape you committed in this case are founded on the same facts. Therefore, in view of the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I consider it appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the first and the second counts.
 
 
• The maximum sentence for the offence of aggravated robbery contrary to section 311(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (“Crimes Decree”) is 20 years imprisonment. The tariff for this offence is an imprisonment term between 8 to 16 years. [Wallace Wise v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0004 of 2015; (24 April 2015)]
 
 
• The maximum sentence for the offence of rape under section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree is imprisonment for life. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of an adult victim is a term of imprisonment between 7 years and 15 years. (State v Naicker [2015] FJHC 537; HAC279.2013)
 
 
• I consider the following as the aggravating factors relevant to the first count and the second count; 
• The vulnerability of the elderly victim who was 74 years old;
 
• The nature and the magnitude of the force used (punching her causing her nasal bridge to be broken, dragging her on the floor and tying her hands with a belt);
 
• You raped the victim while her hands were tied together;
 
• Your forceful penile penetration caused the 74-year-old victim immense pain and she sustained a serious vaginal injury.
 

 
• Your counsel submitted that you are a young offender and that you have cooperated with the police as your mitigating factors. Though you are a young offender you are not a first offender. As I have explained above, this court should regard the protection of the community as the primary objective of sentencing you in this case though you are a young offender. You have admitted giving a false name to the police and therefore I cannot agree with your counsel’s submission that you cooperated with the police. I do not find any mitigating factors in this case.
 
 
• I select 10 years as the starting point of your aggregate sentence for the first and the second counts. Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I increase your sentence to 18 years imprisonment. Since there are no mitigating factors, your aggregate sentence for the first and the second counts shall be 18 years imprisonment.
 
 
• The offence of giving false information to a public servant contrary to section 201 of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 5 years.
 
 
• You gave a false name to the police to avoid being identified by the police given your previous record. However, you pleaded guilty to the third count when the Information was first read to you. Considering all the circumstances I sentence you for a term of 6 months imprisonment for the third count. You shall serve this term of 6 months concurrently with the aggregate term of imprisonment imposed on you for the first and the second counts.
 
 
• Accordingly, your final sentence is 18 years imprisonment. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 15 years of your sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree reads thus;

“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• I note that you have spent 11 months and 19 days in custody in relation to this case after deducting the period you were a serving prisoner. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you in view of the provisions of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. I hold that the period that should be regarded as served is one year.
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years. Considering the time spent in custody, the time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 17 years
 
Non-parole period – 14 years
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

77302,"JUDGMENT

On 22nd April 2002 the appellant was convicted on his own plea of guilty by the Suva Magistrate’s Court of the offence of ATTEMPTED RAPE and sentenced to three years imprisonment.

Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED RAPE: Contrary to Section 151 of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

NEMANI KAVEREVERE, alias NEMANI BULIVUARUA KAVEREVERE between the 10th day of April, 2002 and 11th day of April 2002 at Lami in the Central Division, attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a women namely [the complainant] without her consent.

The appellant in person appeals against the sentence and while it is difficult to make sense out of the filed grounds, it appears that the grounds are:

1) that the police conspired to charge him of attempted rape.

2) that he was wrongly charged because his intention was only to break into complainant’s house.

It was alleged by the prosecution in the outline of facts that between 10.00 p.m. of 10th April 2002 to 1.00 a.m. on 11th April 2002, complainant who is 45 years old was alone at her flat at Lami. She heard a dog barking so she opened her door to check. As soon as she opened her door, the appellant rushed in with a kitchen knife and put it on her neck. He demanded for money and as she had no money, she gave her wedding ring and watch to the appellant.

The accused saw that the complainant was wearing her nightclothes so he pushed her on the bed and lay on top of her. He tried to have sexual intercourse with her but could not penetrate as he could not get an erection. He licked complainant’s private parts and fondled her breasts and again unsuccessfully tried to have sex.

The complainant reported matter to police.

Except for the fact that he was carrying a knife, the appellant admitted other facts, which the learned Chief Magistrate ruled were quite sufficient to prove attempted rape.

In mitigation the appellant inter alia said ""I was drunk at the time. I used to drink near complainant’s house. I went past the complainant’s room. The light was on. She was naked. I was tempted"".

There cannot be a clearer case of unequivocal plea of guilty than this and really this appeal should not be allowed in terms of Section 309 of the Criminal Procedure Code. I could have disposed of the matter here.

However, since the appellant was not represented, I will briefly consider his argument that there was no attempt to rape. His intention was only to break into the house.

The word ‘attempt’ is defined in Section 380 of the Penal Code as follows:

""Where a person, intending to commit an offence, begins to put his intentions into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment, and manifests his intention by some overt act, but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence, he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence.

It is immaterial, except so far as regards punishment, whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence, or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will, or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention.

It is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to the offender it is impossible in fact to commit the offence.""

The intent of accused is same in rape as in attempted rape. That intent is to have sexual intercourse together with knowledge or recklessness as to the absence of consent – R. v. Khan 1990 2 All E.R. 783.

In the present case there were a number of overt acts which went beyond the mere preparatory stage and which show that he had begun to execute his intention. These are that the appellant had –

1) pushed the complainant onto a bed
2) he lay on top of her
3) he tried to have sex with her but could not as he could not get an erection
4) he licked her private parts and fondled her breasts
5) he again lay on top of her to have sex.

In short he tried to have sex twice but failed to penetrate.

In Epironi Levukaiciwa & Others v. The State - Crim. Appeal HAA0087 of 2001 unreported judgment of Justice Nazhat Shameem the accused lay on top of the complainant to have sex. He still had his clothes on and when the complainant pleaded with him he stopped and did not take his clothes off. In dealing with this issue of attempt she commented:

""Section 380 makes it clear that a man is guilty of an attempted rape when, with the intention to rape, he does an overt act, and the fact that he changed his mind, or he was prevented from completing the offence by independent circumstances, is irrelevant to his conviction.""

In the present case there are a series of admitted overt acts as stated above on the basis of which the learned Magistrate was quite correct in convicting the appellant of attempted rape.

The appellant also complains of severity of sentence. He says three years is excessive sentence. The only mitigating factor is the guilty plea thereby saving court’s time.

There are a number of aggravating features to this case. There was violence used by the appellant. The injuries may not be serious but they are multiple as shown by the medical report. There were abrasions on the right and left side of lower jaw, abrasion on left hand and under the wedding ring, abrasions on the left thigh and right thigh.

There were two attempts to rape. The complainant is aged 45 and was alone at home and therefore vulnerable. The incident occurred at night inside complainant’s house. The appellant had forced himself into the privacy of complainant’s home and subjected her to indignities in her own home. The appellant has a string of previous convictions since 1996. He is an annual visitor to the courts and not a first offender.

The learned Magistrate in his sentencing approach looked at the maximum penalty, considered the starting point of five years, looked at the mitigating factors and sentenced the accused to three years imprisonment.

This was a very serious case of attempted rape and the sentence of three years imprisonment was quite proper and may have been a bit lenient. Appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

80882,"SENTENCE

	1.	After a three days trial, the three assessors found you guilty on the following information, the court agreed with them and convicted you accordingly:

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

TUVITA RAQILI on the 16 day of February 2013, at Caubati, in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of A. L, without her consent.

	1.	The facts were as follows. On 16 February 2013, at about 3 am, the complainant (26 years) and her de facto husband (27 years) returned home from the nightclub. It was a Saturday. They had been drinking liquor and partying with friends. Their home was at Caubati. Because they were exhausted, they immediately went to sleep in their bedroom.

	2.	The accused, aged 39 years, was the complainant's husband's uncle. He was also living in the same flat with the couple. He returned home at 4 am on 16 February 2013, after drinking at a nightclub. He saw the complainant and her husband sleeping in the bedroom. He went to the complainant, and raped her while she was asleep. The complainant awoke to find the accused having sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. He knew she was not consenting to sex, as he blocked her mouth with a hand, to avoid her raising the alarm.

	3.	As had been repeatedly said by the courts before, ""rape"" is the worst form of sexual violation. It robs a person of her or his dignity. It seriously violates the person's human rights. Consequently, the law prescribes a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. However, previous case laws had set the tariff between 7 to 16 years imprisonment. The actual sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

	4.	In this case, the aggravating factors were as follows:
		(i) Breach of Trust. The complainant's de facto husband was the accused's nephew. As such, he stands in a position of trust to him. By raping the complainant, he not only breached the complainant's trust, he also breach the trust his nephew had in him;

		(ii) By offending against the complainant, he showed utter disregard to the complainant's right as a human being, and her right to a peaceful life free from unwanted intrusion.

	5.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) At the age of 39 years, this is your first offence;
		(ii) You had been remanded in custody for approximately one year.

	6.	I start with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 10 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 3 years, leaving a balance of 7 years imprisonment.

	7.	For raping the complainant on 16 February 2013, I sentence you, Tuvita Raqili, to 7 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years, effective forthwith.

	8.	The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

• Sulio Vuniamatana Tuinayau, you stand convicted of the following offences;
 

COUNT ONE
 
Statement of offence
 
Rape: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2)(c) and (3) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
SULIO VUNIAMATANA TUINAYAU between the 1st day of July 2011 to the 31st day of July 2011, at Kadavu in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of MLV a child under the age of 13 years with his penis.
 
 
COUNT TWO
 
Statement of offence
 
Sexual Assault: Contrary to section 210 (1)(a)of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
Particulars of offence
 
SULIO VUNIAMATANA TUINAYAU between the 1st day of July 2011 to the 31st day of July 2011, at Kadavu in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted MLV by touching her vagina.
 
  
• The assessors returned with a unanimous opinion that you are guilty of the two counts. This court decided to accept the unanimous opinion of the assessors and convicted you accordingly.
 
 
• Brief facts are as follows. You are victim’s grandmother’s brother and the victim calls you “grandfather”. The victim was living with you and your family in 2011. One day in the month of July 2011 after lunch, you penetrated the victim’s mouth with your penis. A few days later, you removed her underwear and touched her vagina. At the time you committed the two offences you were 42 years old and the victim was 9 years old.
 
 
• The victim was under your care and protection during the time you committed the two offences. You were in the position of a father figure to her and it was your responsibility to look after the victim. You have abused your position of authority and trust. You knew that your granddaughter was already a victim of a similar offence and yet decided to sexually exploit her. 
 
 
• Pursuant to section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (“Crimes Decree”) read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of a child victim is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• I select 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence in respect of the first count.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• you abused your position of trust and authority; 
 
• the age gap between you and the victim which is 33 years; and
 
• you exploited her vulnerability knowing that she is already a victim of a similar offence.
 

 
• You have no previous convictions. Your previous good character will be considered as a mitigating factor.
 
 
• Your counsel has highlighted the following as your personal circumstances; 
• you are 47 years old, married with 1 child; and
 
• you are a farmer.
 

 
• Considering the aggravating factors, your sentence is increased by 4 years and I deduct 2 years of your sentence considering your previous good character.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment for the first count of rape.
 
 
• The offence of sexual assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012), this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault.
 
 
• You have touched the naked genitalia of the complainant. I select 2 years as the starting point of your sentence for the offence of sexual assault. Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors and the mitigating factor, I sentence you to an imprisonment term of 4 years.
 
 
• I order that you serve the two sentences concurrently. Accordingly, your final sentence is 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Your counsel requests this court to refrain from fixing a non-parole period in order for you to obtain the maximum benefit of the provisions with regard to remission given the present practice adopted by the Prisons and Corrections Service.
 
 
• Section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree provides that ‘when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole’. The only exception where a court can refrain from fixing a non-parole period when sentencing an offender for an imprisonment term of two years or more is provided under section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• In terms of the said subsection, a court can decide not to fix a non-parole period when sentencing an offender for a term of two years or above, if the court considers that it is not appropriate to fix a non-parole period given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender. According to the plain reading, the said section is applicable where a court considers that an offender should not be released on parole early and should serve the full sentence, given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender.
 
• Therefore, I am of the view that section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree cannot be applied in order to refrain from fixing a non-parole period considering the circumstances of this case. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 08 years of your sentence in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• You have spent 05 days in remand pending your sentence. Considering the fact that I have deducted 2 years in view of the mitigating factor and the fact that the period in remand was only 05 days, I order that the said 05 days shall not be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served pursuant to the provisions of section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 12 years with a non-parole period of 08 years.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

71631,"SENTENCE

Simione Sigavinaka, you have pleaded guilty, that on the 30th day of December 2003, Malolo, Nadi in the Western Division by an unlawful act caused the death of Mere Vokanivanua. This is your sentence.

The facts that you have acknowledged are that between 6.30am and 7.45am on the 30th December 2003 at Malolo on Tunalia Road, Nadi in the Western Division caused the death of Mere Vokanivanua at the time she was 25 years of age.

You and she had been living as husband and wife for the last 6 years at that time. You then at that time had a 2 ½ year old daughter. You and she both worked in Ghimli Garment Factory in Namaka and you lived in a 2 bedroom flat at Malolo, Nadi.

On the 29th December 2003 at about 6.00pm, you and she finished work and went to Nadi to do some shopping. You gave what was purchased to your wife and you told her to take the lead home. You were going back to your workplace to have some drinks with some friends.

You then took your friends to Malolo to drink in a vacant house. At around midnight, one of your friends, Kaliova Kolilevu and Siteri Nakatudrau left the group to sleep in your spare bedroom while you and your friend moved to Apolosi Seru’s house and continued drinking till 6.00am on the 30th December 2003.

You went home at around 6.00am and the deceased opened the door of the house. You and she had argument after which she started screaming for help. Her screams for help were heard by your friends in the second bedroom and by other neighbours. According to a neighbour, the deceased screamed for help lasted about 30 minutes before everything was quiet.

You admitted in your caution interview that you slapped the deceased twice and punched her once on the face. You also admit that the deceased’s head hit the concrete wall and the concrete floor when she was felled by your punch.

The Post Mortem report dated the 31st December 2003 shows that the deceased suffered significant injuries which most relevantly might be summarized as a sub-dural hematoma over the brain especially over the left cerebrum. Sub-arachnoid haemorrhages also over the left cerebrum. Partially collapsed lungs bilaterally. Extensive scalp haematomas and haemorrhages and it reports the cause of death as being sub-dural haematomas and sub-arachnoid haemorrhages consistent with heavy blows to the head.

At around 1.00pm, you went to call the deceased to have lunch but she did not respond to your calls. You left the deceased and joined your other friends to have lunch. At around 4.30pm, you told your friends that the deceased was still not responding to your calls.

You then on the advice of your friends took the deceased to the Nadi Hospital. You and your friends then arranged for a transport. Upon arriving at the hospital, she was taken to the Emergency Department where she was pronounced dead. You were subsequently arrested and interviewed and you admitted punching the deceased.

You were born on the 7th October 1975. You were 28 years of age at the time the offence was committed and you are now 30 years of age.

You attended Barotu Indian School from Classes 1 to 8 at the Rakiraki Public School until 1991. In 1994 to 1999 you were employed as a guardman with Guard Force and later in 2000, you obtained employment as a garment worker in Namaka. You are currently employed as a labourer at San Bruno Hotel in Nadi. You are described as having co-operated with the police in the course of their investigation. Whilst you have three prior convictions dating back to 1996, two of those three convictions are subsequent to the commission of this offence, certainly unrelated behaviour.

You told the court by your counsel that you have a relationship with your daughter, that you have reconciled with the deceased’s parents and that they take care of your daughter and I am urged by your counsel to impose upon you a non custodial sentence or at least a sentence of less than 3 years.

The Fiji Court of Appeal considered the difficulty in determining an appropriate punishment for manslaughter in Kim Nam Bae v The State – Cr. App. No. AAU0015 of 1998S. The court in that case said:

“The task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculation. This particularly so with manslaughter where the circumstances and the offender’s culpability can vary greatly from case to case. An appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations. In order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case, the courts must have regard to sentences imposed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence.

The cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal. It is important to bear in mind that this range covers a very wide set of varying circumstances which attract different sentences in different manslaughter cases. Each case will attract the appropriate sentence within the range depending on its own facts.”

It is suggested that there would be some provocation in this case and that you were provoked by your wife when she questioned you when you returned home at 6.00am. I find such provocation to be minimal.

In Sashi Kapoor Rayan v The State – Cr. App. No. AAU0028 of 2000S, the court there noted that sentences for manslaughter of a serious case range from 7 to 10 years and of a less serious type fall into a midrange, which I take to be 3 to 6 years and of course, even less serious in low range below 3 years.

I have been referred to State v Mosese Waqasaqa Rawaqa – Cr. Case No. HAC0007 of 2001S where Madam Justice Shameem imposed a sentence of 9 years imprisonment after trial for a death resulting from a domestic situation and what Her Ladyship described as a situation where the accused had beaten the deceased to death.

I am also referred to State v Anand Dinesh Mani & Anor – Cr. Case No. HAC0005 of 2000S, a further decision of Madam Justice Shameem, Her Ladyship imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years on the accused who was convicted after trial where the circumstances involving the death of the deceased included the use of the knife. In passing sentence Her Ladyship noted:

“Although I did not put this case into a category of minimal provocation with gross violence nor do I consider the case of grave provocation with minimum violence.”

I take from the words used that it was seen by Her Ladyship as a midrange type of case. In addition, counsel for the accused refers the court the decision of Mr. Justice Govind, a term of imprisonment of 18 months was imposed upon an accused after trial where the deceased died of drowning in a shallow creek after being punched twice by the accused. Again, a death arising from a domestic situation.

The State refers the court to the State v Salesh Virendra Kumar – Cr. Case No. HAC0004 of 2004, Mr. Justice Govind sentenced the accused to 2 ½ years imprisonment where the accused was convicted on a plea of guilty. Again for a death resulting from a domestic situation.

The incidence of domestic violence offences in this country seems constantly high with an unacceptable level of its acceptance of violence thereto and its incumbent on the court to clearly show that such behaviour is not acceptable in any community in this country.

State Counsel urges that a starting point of 4 ½ years is inappropriate. With that I concur, however, I am of the opinion that a significant discount is to be given to the accused by virtue of his early plea of guilty notwithstanding that the offences were committed some 1 year and 10 months ago. The State on 

the 9th September 2005, filed an information with respect to manslaughter and immediately a plea of guilty was entered.

It is appropriate for a discount of one-third to be given for an early plea of guilty and in my opinion the accused is entitled to the total of this discount. In doing so, I reiterate as I said at the outset or more particularly, what was said by the Court of Appeal in Kim Nam Bae, that the task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculation and nor should it be. However, giving you what the law might consider the maximum discount for the early plea of guilty I come to a resultant sentence of 3 years imprisonment and accordingly, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years.

	1.	FILIPE BABA, you were convicted by this Court after a trial for one count of Rape contrary to section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap17. 

	2.	In the trial it was revealed that on 08th December 2009 at Queen Elizabeth Drive, Suva you with another raped one Vani Baleisuva. 

LAW AND TARIFF

	1.	The maximum penalty for this offence under the Penal Code is life imprisonment. 

	2.	In State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC0016T.2003S (23 April 2004) his Lordship Justice Gates (as he then was) said :

“Parliament has prescribed the sentence of life imprisonment for rape. Rape is the most serious sexual offence. The courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and by meting out harsh sentences.

A long custodial sentence is inevitable. This is to mark the gravity of the offence as felt, and correctly so, by the community. Imprisonment emphasizes the public’s disapproval and serves as a warning to others who may hitherto regard such acts lightly. One must not ignore the validity of the imposition of condign punishment for serious crime. Lastly the sentence is set in order to protect women from such crimes: Roberts and Roberts (1982) 4 Cr. App R(S) 8; The State v Lasaro Turagabeci and Others (unreported) Suva High Court Crim. Case No. HAC0008.1996S .”

	1.	In Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 it was stated :

“We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage” 

	1.	The above decision was supported in, Drotini v. The State [2006] FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005S (24 March 2006) where the court observed :

“The continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in levels of sentences ordered in rape cases by the courts of Fiji. We endorse that trend. We do not suggest that the starting point described in Mohammed Kasim’s case should altered in rape cases in general but the sentencing court should not hesitate to increase the sentence substantially where there are further aggravating factors”.

	1.	In State v Loco [2010] FJHC 465; HAC047.2008L (22 October 2010) his Lordship Justice Madigan said :

“Kasim v State [1994] FJCA 25 set a starting point of rape of an adult at 7 years and Madam Justice Shameem said in Poese v State [2005] FJHC 9 that the tariff on one count is from 5 to 10 years; however Shameem J. further said in Bulimaiwai v State [2005] FJHC 261 ""sentences at the upper end of the tariff should be imposed where gratuitous violence is inflicted, where a weapon is used"".

AGGRAVATING FACTORS

	1.	You assaulted the victim causing injuries to her face. The victim got in to your taxi to go to her home and taking advantage of her vulnerability you dragged her to the park and committed this offence. You committed this offence with another person. 

MITIGATION FACTORS

	1.	In your mitigation you said you are 35 years old married and looking after you mother and other family members. Also you said you are remorseful and seek forgiveness from this Court. 

	2.	I select 07 years as my starting point and add 04 years for aggravating factors to reach 11 years. Deduct 02 years for mitigating factors to reach 09 years imprisonment. You are not a first offender and therefore not entitled for any discount for that. 

	3.	For a similar offence you are serving a prison sentence of 08 years with a non – parole period of 07 years. Therefore pursuant to section 20(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I impose a new non- parole period of 08 years for this case. 

	4.	Accordingly you are sentenced to 09 years imprisonment for the Offence of Rape with a non parole period of 08 years to be concurrent with your present sentence. 

	5.	28 days to appeal

• Jagdishwar Singh, upon pleading guilty, you stand convicted for the following offences;
 

COUNT 2
 
Statement of offence
 
Rape: Contrary to section 207 (1) and 2(c) and (3) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
JAGDISHWAR SINGH on the 11th day of October, 2014 at Vuci South, Nausori in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of Gaura Dasi, a child under the age of 13 years, with his penis.
 
 
COUNT 3
 
Statement of offence
 
Sexual Assault: Contrary to section 210(1)(a) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
JAGDISHWAR SINGH on the 11th day of October, 2014 at Vuci South, Nausori in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted Gaura Dasi.
 
  
• The facts of this case according to the summary of facts are as follows;

“Rape contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(c) and (3) of the Crimes Decree.
 
On the 11th day of October 2014, Gaura Dasi, a child under the age of 13, (hereafter PW1) was sleeping at her home. PW1’s home was located at Vuci South, Nausori. On the said night, PW1 was sleeping with the accused, Jagdishwar Singh (hereafter “the Accused”) who is her biological father.
 
 
The accused on the said night, woke her up and took her to the washroom. After going to the washroom, the accused then took PW1 back to the bedroom. The accused put is penis into the PW1’s mouth and told her to suck it.
 
 
Sexual Assault contrary to section 210 (1)(a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
On the 11th day of October 2014, the Accused unlawfully and indecently assaulted PW1 by rubbing his penis on PW1’s thighs. The Accused told PW1 not to tell her mother about his actions or else she would smack PW1.”
 
  
• The maximum sentence for the offence of rape under section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (“Crimes Decree”) is imprisonment for life and the sentencing tariff for rape of a child is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014).
 
 
• The offence of sexual assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012), this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault.
 
 
• Rape and sexual assault are offences of similar character. Therefore, in view of the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), I consider it appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of the two offences. Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree reads thus;

“If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.”
 
  
• I select 11 years as the starting point of your aggregate sentence.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors in this case;

 a) you are the victim’s father; there is a breach of trust;
 
 b) the age gap between you and the victim is 25 years; and
 
 c) you took advantage of the victim’s vulnerability and naivety.
 
  
• I consider the following as mitigating factors;

 a) you are a first offender and you are 31 years old;
 
 b) you co-operated with the police; and
 
 c) you are remorseful.
 
  
• You have made admissions regarding the two offences in your cautioned interview. You were initially represented by a private counsel and you pleaded not guilty to the charges. You retained the services of the Legal Aid Commission on 30/03/16 and on the next mention date, your counsel informed that you wish to plead guilty for the two counts you are now convicted of. You pleaded guilty well before the trial date and prevented the child victim from having to relate to her miserable experience before this court. In the circumstances, though you have not pleaded guilty on the first available opportunity, I consider it appropriate to give you a considerable reduction. 
 
 
• Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I increase your sentence by 5 years.
 
 
• Considering the above mitigating factors, I deduct 4 years. Now your sentence is 12 years.
 
 
• In view of your relatively early guilty plea, I deduct 2 years and 6 months.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to an imprisonment term of 9 years and 6 months. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 08 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.
 

14. Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree reads thus;
 
“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• I note that you have spent 1 year 09 months and 07 days in remand. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you pertaining to the sentence imposed on you in this case.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 08 years. Considering the time spent in remand, the time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 07 years, 08 months and 23 days
 
Non-parole period – 06 years, 02 months and 23 days
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

73315,"SENTENCE

	1.	You are charged as follows:

First Count
Statement of Offence

Rape: Contrary to Sections 207 (1) and (2) (a) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

Seremaia Dela between the 1st day of December, 2012 and 31st day of December, 2012, at Nadelei Village, Vatukoula, Tavua in the Western Division, penetrated the vagina of IT, a child under the age of 13 years, with his penis.

Second Count
Statement of Offence

Sexual Assault: Contrary to Sections 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

Seremaia Dela between the 1st day of December, 2012 and 31st day of December, 2012, at Nadelei Village, Vatukoula, Tavua in the Western Division, unlawfully and indecently licked the vagina of IT, without her consent.

	1.	On 28th November 2013 you pleaded guilty to both charges against you and admitted the Summary of Facts on 4th December 2013.

	2.	The Summary of Facts submitted by the State Counsel states as follows:

Sometimes on the 1st day of December 2012 to the 31st December 2012, IT (hereinafter referred to as the ""Victim"") was on her way to her friends place when Seremaia Dela (hereinafter referred to as the ""Accused"") who is her neighbor was already waiting for her in the nearby bush. The victim went passed where the accused was hiding and he grabbed her left hand from behind and pushed her to the ground. The victim was wearing a white short and a brown t-shirt which the accused forcefully removed and started touching the victim's vagina. After sometimes the accused removed his shorts and underwear and inserted his erected penis in her vagina. The victim was helpless as the accused was on top of her. It lasted for about 20 minutes and when the accused finished he informed the victim not to tell anyone else or he will do something to her. Victim was frightened all along and never informed anyone about the incident.

The second incident occurred sometimes between the 1st day of December 2012 to the 31st December 2012 when the victim went to feed the pigs in its pen near the river alone. Again the accused approached her and pulled her right hand and pushed her to the ground. The accused then forcefully removed her pants and panty and started licking her vagina for some time and went away.

This matter came to light when the police women in Vatukoula Police Station gave lecture to the students at Nadelei Catholic School where the victim relayed her story to WPC 4280 Bula. The accused was arrested, interviewed under caution to which he admitted to the offence.

The victim was 12 years old at the time of the offence.

	1.	After carefully considering the Plea of you to be unequivocal this Court found you guilty for one count of Rape and one count of Sexual Assault and accordingly you are convicted for one count under Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree and one count under section 210 (1) of the Crimes Decree respectively.

	2.	Accused Seremaia Dela you stand convicted for one count of Rape and one count of Sexual Assault.

	3.	The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of His Lordship Mr. A.H.C.T. Gates in State v Marawa. [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.

	4.	In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed: 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

	1.	The tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 15 years. 

	2.	In State v Mario Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 His Lordship Mr. Paul Madigan held that:

""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""

In this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter.

	1.	In State v Anthony [2012] FJHC 1013; HAC 151.2010 His Lordship Mr. Priynatha Nawana held that:

""The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl of MB's standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in case of this nature, deterrence is therefore, of paramount importance."" 

	1.	Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 13 years imprisonment for the charge of Rape.

	2.	Aggravating factors;
		(a) The victim was of a younger and tender age,
		(b) Victim was subjected to more than one sexual act,
		(c) You had made the victim sexually active at a young age,
		(d) You had traumatized the life of the victim.

Considering all, I increase your sentence by 3 years, now the sentence is 16 years imprisonment.

	1.	For the guilty plea, I deduct 3 years and now your sentence is 13 years.

	2.	Mitigating circumstances:
		(a) You are first offender at the age of 38 years until you were convicted and sentenced by this Court on 29.11.2013. 

Considering all, I reduce 1 year from your sentence, now your sentence is 12 years 
imprisonment.

	1.	You were in remand from 12.6.2013 for a period of 5 months. That period is already deducted in HAC 12/2013.

	2.	Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 11 years as non parole period.

	3.	The maximum penalty for the offence of Sexual Assault is 14 years imprisonment. 

	4.	The tariff for the offence of Sexual assault is between 2 to 8 years imprisonment as decided in Abdul Khaiyum HAC 160/2010 by Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan.

	5.	I start the sentence for charge of sexual assault at 2 years and add 2 years for the aggravation factors mentioned above and deduct 1 year for the mitigating factors. 

	6.	For charge of sexual assault, I sentence you for a period of 3 years with a non parole period of 2 years.

	7.	Your sentences are as follows: 
		(i) 1st count of Rape - 11 years 7 months
		(ii) 2nd count of Sexual assault - 3 years

	8.	The Fiji Court of Appeal in Vukitoga v State [2013] FJCA 19; AAU 0049.2008 (13 March 2013) cited with approval the following citation of D.A. Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (2nd edition, 1979) p. 56-57 which was cited in High Court of Australia judgment Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70:

""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong'; ""when... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behavior and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.""

	1.	Considering the totality principle, I order the sentences of all two charges to run concurrently.

	2.	Further you are already serving a sentence of 11 years 7 months given to you on 29.11.2013. You have pleaded guilty to all the charges in five separate similar cases.
If separate sentences are given for each of these cases it will have a crushing effect on you. The State had conceded this position. Thus I order this sentence to run concurrently with the sentences you are already serving.

	1.	There was report from psychiatrist Victor Herald Wasson that you are fit to plea. The doctor was called to give evidence. According to him you had schizophrenia. Now you are treated and fit to plea. Further such treatment could be continued while you are in remand. Once you served the term, a community treatment order could be issued if needed.

Summary

	1.	You are sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 11 years of imprisonment. This sentence to run concurrently with other sentences already ordered.

	2.	Prison authorities are directed to continue with the treatment of you acting under Section 86 (1) & (2) of the Mental Health Decree, 2010. 

	3.	30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

79221,"SENTENCE

	1.	It is hereby ordered to permanently suppress the name and the identity of the victim.

	2.	Samuela Kiniboi, you have been convicted for one count of Attempted Rape: contrary to section 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 and one count of Rape: contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 on your unequivocal plea of guilty entered on 10th of July 2013.

	3.	First Count: 

Statement of Offence (a)

ATTEMPTED RAPE: Contrary to 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 

Particulars of Offence (b)

Samuela Kiniboi, between the 01st day of January 2011 and 31st day of December 2011 at Tumavia, Nakelo in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of M.R. without her consent.

Second Count

Statement of Offence (a)

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009

Particulars of Offence (b)

SAMUELA KINIBOI, on the 29TH DAY OF March 2012 and 30th day of April 2012 at Tumavia village, Nakelo in the Central Division penetrated the vagina of M.R. with his finger without her consent.

	1.	There is an alternative charge of SEXUAL ASSAULT as the third count. You pleaded guilty to the alternative count as well. In sentencing you, I do not consider that as it was for the alternative count. The Summary of Facts produced in court revealed that between the 01st day of January 2011 and 31st December 2011 at Tumavia in Nakelo, you had undressed yourself and laid the victim on a bed after undressing her. Then you being naked had lay on top of the victim and attempted to insert your penis into the victim's vagina. Further to that, you between 29th day of March 2012 and 30th day of April 2012, at the same vicinity had penetrated the vagina of M.R. with your finger. You were 71 years at the time of the commission of the offences whilst the victim was just 6 years old.

	2.	Later the incidents had been reported to Nausori Police. The victim had been medically examined by a medical examiner and observed that ""Mild abrasion at 7 o'clock site at the border of the hymen and inner labia minora. Hymen regular and intact."" You had made a full admission to the police under caution as well.

	3.	The maximum penalty for the offence of Rape is life imprisonment. When a child victim is involved, the tariff in our jurisdiction for the offence of rape ranges from 10 – 15 years imprisonment. (see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva, State v NK, Criminal Case No. HAC 155 of 2010, State v Nacanieli Yavala, Criminal Case No. HAC 129 of 2012 and State v Simione Taleusila, Criminal Case No. HAC 11 of 2010). 

	4.	It is worthy of reminding once again what was highlighted in the case of Mohammed Kasim v State (1994) FJCA 25; AAU 0021j.93S (27 May 1994):

""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

	1.	Justice Gates, as he was then, stated in State v. Marawa (2004) FJHC 338, that:

""Rape is the most serious sexual offence. Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and meting out harsher sentences"" (paragraph 10)

	1.	In terms of Section 208 of the Crimes Decree, the maximum penalty for the offence of ""Attempted Rape"" is 10 years imprisonment. Justice Shameem, in the cases of Jioji Aunima v. State (HAA 033 of 2010) and Bulimaiwai v The State [2005] FJHC 261; HAA 0068J.2005 S(02nd of September 2005) had identified the tariff for the offence of attempted rape should be 12 months to 05 years imprisonment. 

	2.	After a careful consideration of the legal background on Sentencing for the offences of Rape and Attempted Rape, I now turn to identify the Aggravating and Mitigating grounds in this particular instance. The learned State Counsel submitted a comprehensive Sentencing Submission along with the Victim Impact Assessment Report. The learned Counsel for the defense filed pertinent submissions in Mitigation. The Victim Impact Assessment Report clearly reflects that the emotional and psychological effects to the victim over the alleged sexual acts are enormous. It says that after these incidents, the victim is at a loss and always day dreaming at the home and in the class. She does not perform in the school. The most alarming portion in the report is that ""when she looks at older people she is afraid. She is frightened to be alone in class.""

	3.	The huge disparity in ages between you and the victim, in all means aggravates the background of offending. The victim was just six years of age at the time of the commission of the offence whilst you were 71 years old. The age gap was 65 years. This fact alone is not reconcilable or compensated in any way. Your children must be having their own children older than the victim. On the other hand your conduct amounts to a serious breach of trust. You were an elderly person, almost like the grandfather of the victim, in the close vicinity of the victim's native environment and should have been a role model to the younger generations. Instead, you simply lured the small girl with some oranges. The victim would not have come to your house anticipating this disastrous experience resulting her to be afraid of every old man comes across her entire life. This background undoubtedly aggravates your offending.

	4.	In Mitigation, you claim that you are 72 years of age and residing alone in Tumavia, Nakelo, Tailevu after separated from your wife and three children in 1980. You are unemployed, but engaged in subsistence farming. You pleaded guilty to both the counts without going for a full trial, saving the time and resources of the state and the court. You had no intention to do such an act to the complainant. Nothing was pre-planned and all happened in the spur of the moment. You acknowledge that what you did was wrong and inexcusable. You are sincerely remorseful and seek for forgiveness from court. You admit that your action brought much embarrassment and humiliation to the family. You promise not to reoffend and now engage Evangelism work in the Apostles Church as a pioneer. You have maintained a crime free record for over a decade and had co-operated with the police being truthful and honest of the allegation. You seek forgiveness from court and an opportunity to reform and rehabilitate. You have been in remand custody for one week since 30th of July 2013 in relation to this case. Finally, you are seeking for leniency as you are not a habitual offender and a longer custodial sentence would not serve justice. 

	5.	Having considered the legal and factual background, I take a starting point of 12 years imprisonment for the charge of 'Rape'. I add 06 years for all the Aggravating factors stated in paragraph 11. This court is of the view that this is a fit and proper instance to award you a deduction of a full third for your early plea of guilty as it indicates the true colors of remorse. Further, this court thinks fit to deduct another 2 years from the interim period for all the other mitigating factors averred in paragraph 12 inclusive of your previous good character for over a decade and the one week incarceration. Your final sentence for the count of Rape is 10 years imprisonment.

	6.	It has been well established that the courts will often look into the higher end of the tariff when there is a serious breach of trust or the age gap between the offender and the victim is considerably high. Therefore, in this instance, I take a starting point of 04 years imprisonment for the offence of 'Attempted Rape'. I add 02 years imprisonment for all the Aggravating factors mentioned earlier and deduct 1 year for all the Mitigating factors. It has to be borne in mind that though the charge remains as 'attempted rape', you were almost there in achieving the target. Your final sentence for the offence of 'Attempted Rape' is 05 years imprisonment. 

	7.	Your final sentences stand as follows.

• Count No. 1 – Attempted Rape – 05 years imprisonment.
• Count No. 2 – Rape – 10 years imprisonment.

	1.	Having considered the concepts of 'totality principle' it is hereby ordered that the sentence for the 01st count of 'Attempted Rape' be served concurrently with the sentence for the 02nd count of 'Rape'. Thus, your final sentence is 10 years imprisonment. 

	2.	It is at this juncture, this court has to decide whether to proceed ahead with the final sentence of 10 years imprisonment or to grant 'some concession' to you because of your elderly age. In the case of Ratu Penioni Rokota v The State, [2002] FJHC 168; HAA0068J.2002S [23 August 2002] Justice Shameem cited the following paragraph from Principles of Sentencing of D. A. Thomas, (2nd Ed at page 196).

""Recognition of age as a mitigation factor does not mean that imprisonment should never be imposed on elderly offenders, and the Court has upheld sentences of imprisonment on men in their seventies. It is however a long-established principle that a sentence should normally be shortened so as to avoid the possibility that the offender will not live to be released.""

	1.	The case of Wilkinson, (14.11.74, 3025/C/74 in Thomas, (supra) page 196) a 05 years imprisonment given to a 60 year old man for committing the offences of indecency over a period of several years with his grandnieces was reduced to 30 months and said though 'a substantial custodial sentence' was inevitable, the offender had a perfectly good record and the offences began when he became 'desperately lonely' widower. In Nicholls (27.6.75, 1233/B/75 in Thomas, (supra) page 196) a 10 year sentence ordered for committing the offences of buggery and gross indecency to a man of 62 years without previous convictions, was reduced to 07 years in appeal saying that even though such a sentence is justified on facts, the sentencer 'did not pay sufficient attention to the factor of age'. 

	2.	A careful consideration of Wilkinson and Nicholls show that even though a considerable attention have to be paid to the 'age factor' in sentencing an elderly person, the final sentence has a bearing on the gravity of the offence as well. The concept of avoiding the elderly persons to be sent to prison for longer periods, though principally correct, this court is of the view that such an approach should not attach a massage to the society that one can get rid of a substantive amount of his criminal responsibility due to the elderly age. It is simply because that, as it is quite understood, the more one gets older with maturity, the more he or she should bear the conviction of being a socially, morally and legally responsible person. Therefore, whilst endorsing the long standing principle of awarding short terms of sentences to elderly offenders, this court stresses that whatever the sentence is to be granted to the accused person should reflect the actual gravity of the crime of which the accused is been charged with.

	3.	This is an instance, as stated above, where a six year old girl is been victimized by the lust of a very elderly offender. It is been stressed time and again that the future of a country or a nation is children. Thus, children must have the right to freedom and especially to spend their childhood without any undue disturbances to its smooth functioning. This court considers that the shocking and shameful sexual activities of this nature expose the small children to the much polluted adult world. The egregiousness of the existing facts of this case and the brazen attitude of the accused towards a small girl will have to get prominence over the elderly age of the accused. Thus, this court is of the view that there is no need of being flexible with the tariff to accommodate any 'special treatment' to you or your elderly age. You will receive an immediate custodial sentence.

	4.	Your final sentence stands as 10 years imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole for 06 years. In determining the parole period, this court seriously considered your age factor and thought it fit not to impose a longer non parole term.

	5.	You have 30 days to Appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

80001,"SENTENCE

	1.	Mr ""A"", you stand convicted and awaiting sentence, as this court, at the end of a full trial, agreed with the unanimous opinion of the assessors and found you guilty to the following count of 'Rape'.

First Count

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) (b) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

'A' on the 18th day of June, 2012 at Serua in the Central Division inserted his fingers into the vagina of 4 year old A.R. without her consent.

	1.	Ms. A.R., the six year (6) old victim told court that one day her ""Tutua"" (means Grandfather in Seruan dialect) touched and poked (tonoka) her ""ivi"" (means vagina in Seruan dialect) by his hand. She referred to you as her ""Tutua"". It was revealed that Ms. A.R. is your son's daughter and thus, you stand as her biological grandfather.

	2.	The victim had been examined by Doctor Salma Sahinaz Khan at Navua Hospital after been sedated. She had observed two lacerations, at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions on the hymen and a slight inflammation around the vaginal orifice. The doctor opined that Ms. A.R's 'hymen was not intact' and that is most likely due to a blunt force been inserted into her vagina.

	3.	Before proceeding to sentence you, it was noted that the Director of Public Prosecutions has not filed their sentencing submissions at the Court Registry on or before 16th of May 2014 and unfortunately up till today, as ordered by this court on 25th of April 2014. I assume that the prosecution has nothing to submit to court on your sentence. The only impediment occurs with this non-co-operation is the absence of the Victim Impact Report. Yet for all, the impact on a small girl of four years (4) after this kind of tragic experience is quite understood. Therefore, whilst been deeply concerned about the non-compliance of the court's directives by the prosecution, I will now proceed to finalize your sentence.

	4.	In terms of section 207 (2) (b), if a person penetrates the vulva, vagina or anus of another person to any extent with a thing or a part of his body other than the penis without consent, that also amounts to the offence of rape. It is in that context, insertion of your finger to Ms. A.R's vagina amounted to rape. There is no issue of 'consent' in this instance, as Ms. A.R., being less than ten years (10) old, is not capable of giving 'consent' to perform any sexual act.

	5.	The maximum sentence for the offence of rape is life imprisonment. The tariff ranges from 10 – 15 years imprisonment when a child victim is involved. (see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva).

	6.	In this background, I take a starting point of 11 years imprisonment to commence the sentencing process.

	7.	Ms. A.R. was around four years of age whilst you were around 63 years at the time of the commission of the offence. The age gap is 59 years. The most grief stricken factor is that Ms. A.R. is your biological granddaughter. You have manifestly breached her trust. This aggravating background will receive you further 4 years imprisonment.

	8.	The learned counsel, on behalf of you, submitted that you are 65 years of age, married with a son and three (3) grandchildren. One grandson, Ms. A.R.'s brother, is been looked after by you and your wife. You, been the sole breadwinner, supported your family by farming and fishing. The counsel submits that the prison environment might not be favourable for your age. You, at last, acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and seek court's forgiveness. The offence was committed only once without any violence been deployed. You are willing to reform, if you get any opportunity and promise not to re-offend. Most importantly, you are a first offender. Having considered all the above mitigating factors, I reduce 3 years imprisonment from your interim sentence of 15 years imprisonment.

	9.	Your final sentence now stands at 12 years imprisonment.

	10.	This court discussed the principles when sentencing an elderly accused in State v Samuela Kiniboi, Crim. Case No. HAC 162 of 2012, (7th of August 2012). In Samuela Kiniboi (supra), the accused pleaded guilty for two counts, Attempted Rape and Rape, contrary to section 208 and section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. He was 71 years of age when committed the offences and 72 when sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for the above mentioned charges. 

	11.	The learned defence counsel drew the attention of court to State v David Spowart, Crim. Case No. HAC 89 of 2011, (24th of July 2013), and asked for a lenient sentence. Madigan J imposed a sentence of 5 years imprisonment to the 74 years old accused in David Spoward (supra) and said that it is well outside the tariff for rapes of children and it should not be taken as an authority which pulls the tariff down.

	12.	This court re-iterates that the egregiousness of your act and the brazen attitude towards your own granddaughter will not in any way help you to get any further concessions.

	13.	You are sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years. A longer term of non-parole period was not imposed because of your elderly age.

	14.	Finally, I note that you are in custody since 25th April 2014. In terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I order that one month to be reduced from your final sentence. Now, your sentence is 11 years and 11 months imprisonment.

265889,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] Mosese Vosa, you have freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty to a charge of act with intent to cause grievous harm contrary to section 255(a) of the Crimes Act 2009. You are represented by counsel. The Court is satisfied that your guilty plea is informed and unambiguous. You are convicted as charged. 
 
 
[2] The circumstances of the offending are set out in the facts tendered by the prosecution and admitted by you. The charge arose from a domestic dispute between you and your wife, the victim. She is 32 years old. You are 51 years old. Together you have two children. Your daughter is 9 years old and your son is 8 years old. Your family is depended on you. 
 
 
[3] The incident occurred on 21 July 2018 in Salia village, Nayau, Lau. You had an argument with your wife regarding her whereabouts the previous night. You accused her of drinking with the youths instead of attending an event for the women in the village. She kept quiet because she was scared of you. When she did not respond to your questions, you beat her in the legs, back and shoulders with the stick several times. When she went inside the house you followed her and gave her more beatings until the stick broke. The violence continued. You punched her in the head and then tried to strangle her by pressing her neck with your bare hands. She kicked you hard when she started to choke. You fell backwards. For a moment she thought that the violence had stopped. But you continued with the use of violence on her after she did not respond to your accusations. You picked up the broken stick and gave her more beatings until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness you were not at the scene. The victim found her daughter beside her, crying. She got up and walked to the health centre accompanied by the village nurse. 
 
[4] The following day, the victim was medically examined at the Lakeba Hospital. According to the medical report, the victim feared for her safety and was in pain. She sustained multiple bruises and swelling all over her body. She was kept in the hospital for neurological observation for 24 hours before being discharged. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious.
 
 
[5] On 23 July 2018, you were arrested and interviewed under caution. You confessed to the use of violence on your wife. You were charged and produced in court. You have been in custody on remand since 23 July 2018. 
 
 
[6] The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is life imprisonment. The tariff is between 6 months to 5 years imprisonment (State v Mokubula [2003] FJHC 164; HAA0052J.2003S (23 December 2003). The seriousness of the offence is gauged by the seriousness of the injuries, premeditation or planning, length and nature of attack and vulnerability of the victim (State v Vakalaca - Sentence [2018] FJHC 455; HAC027.2018 (31 May 2018). 
 
 
[7] In cases of family violence, the primary purpose of the sentence is deterrence, both special and general. The courts have a duty to protect women and children from all forms of violence. Rehabilitation is relevant if the offender has taken responsibility for his crime and has addressed or has offered to address his violent behaviour.
 
 
[8] In her victim impact statement, your wife has said:
 
“I feel sorry for my husband and I have forgiven him. I admitted that due to my action that made my husband assault me. My children want him to come back home and we miss him.”
 
 
[9] The Court has also received a counselling report on the victim. According to the counsellor, the victim is traumatized by the assault inflicted on her by her husband. The victim trusted her husband but she fears that she may be victimized again. However, she blames herself for her predicament because her husband’s family has showed little empathy to her following his arrest. 
 
 
[10] I am mindful of the wishes of the victim to continue with her relationship with her husband. But I am cautious in placing too much weight on her wish. The elephant in the room is the family violence. Without removing the elephant, the sanctity of marriage and family cannot be restored. Violence will continue and the victim is exposed to further physical and psychological harm. The power imbalance between you and the victim as in other similar cases of family violence is obvious. The victims, who mostly are women, are forced to reconcile and live in violent relationships because of cultural barriers and lack of support, financial and emotional. 
 
 
[11] Since you are in custody on remand little assistance is available to you to address your violent behaviour. But I am satisfied that if you are offered rehabilitative programmes for gender based violence you will make an attempt to reform your behaviour. You have expressed genuine remorse by confessing your crime to police and by entering an early guilty plea. Court time and resources have been saved by your early guilty plea. You are also a person with previous good character. For all these mitigating factors I give you a reduction in sentence by one year. 
 
[12] I now consider the aggravating factors. You breached the trust of your wife by inflicting physical violence on her. You had exposed one of your children to violence who was found in a distressed condition after your wife regained her consciousness. A weapon was used to inflict the violence resulting in physical injuries. Manual strangulation resulting in choking was a dangerous act. The beatings were prolonged to a point the victim lost consciousness. 
 
 
[13] These are some grave aggravating factors that justify a jail sentence to denounce family violence and deter you and others from committing family violence. Finally, I am mindful of the proportionality principle, that is, your punishment must fit the crime you committed. 
 
 
[14] Taking all these factors into account, I sentence you to 18 months’ imprisonment. Suspension is inappropriate. You have already served about 4 months in custody on remand. The remaining term you will have to serve is 14 months’ imprisonment. 
 
 
[15] A permanent DVRO with standard non-molestation conditions is issued for the protection of the victim and her children in the future.

74828,"SENTENCE

1. You RONALD RAJESH SWAMI were charged for the offence of, Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary section 275 of the Crime Decree No 44 of 2009. 

2. You elected to represent by yourself and pleaded guilty for the said offence on 03 July 2012.

3. I am satisfied that you fully understand legal effect of your plea and your plea was voluntary and free from influence. Wherefore I convict you for the said offence.

Facts in this case

4. On 02 April 2012 you returned home in your van. The complainant (your wife) asked whether if you had gone to Suva in the van but you denied that. After a while you grabbed the complainant and assaulted her causing the injuries as per the medical report. 

5. You admitted the above facts.

6. The medical report was tendered and the doctor found that the complainant got bruises in her left arm and lower body. 

The Law and the Tariff for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm

7. The sec 275 says maximum penalty for the offence is 05 years imprisonment. 

8. His Lordship justice Goundar held out that the tariff for assault occasioning actual harm ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault (Sereka v State [2008] FJHC 88; HAM 027)

Aggravating factors

7 This is a domestic violence. The complainant is your wife. Also you assaulted her without any provocation.

Mitigating factors

9. I consider following points as mitigating factors in this case

I. Married with children 
II. Seeks forgiveness 
III. Reconciled with the complainant

10. You informed the court that you have reconciled with the complainant. The complainant was present and confirmed that.

11. In a normal scenario these kinds of offences can be reconciled under sec 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree.

154. — (1) In the case of any charge for an offence of common assault or assault occasioning actual bodily harm or criminal trespass or damaging property the court may, in such cases which are — 

(a) substantially of a personal or private nature; and 
(b) not aggravated in degree — 

promote reconciliation and encourage the settlement of the proceedings in an amicable way, on terms of payment of compensation or on other term approved by the court, which may involve — 

(i) the giving of an apology in any appropriate manner; 
(ii) the giving of a promise or undertaking not to re-offend, or to respect the rights and interests of any victim; 
(iii) mandatory attendance at any counseling or other program aimed at rehabilitation; or 
(iv) a promise or undertaking to alter any habits or conduct, such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs. 

(2) A court shall only proceed in accordance with sub-section (1) if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner, and the court shall ensure that the victim of the violence does not submit to any proceedings being undertaken in accordance with this section by reason of pressure being exerted in any form. 

(3) Upon proceeding in accordance with this section the court may then — 

(a) order the proceedings to be stayed for a specified period of time upon the offender entering into any bond to comply with the terms imposed by the court under sub-section (1); or 
(b) dismiss the proceedings. 

12. But sec 154(6) of the Criminal Procedure Decree clearly says that this sec does not apply to domestic violence Offences. Therefore even though you have reconciled I am not going to act under sec 154 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree.

13. But the reconciliation has been taken as a mitigating factor in this case.

14. Now I will decide suitable starting point for your sentence. After considering the facts in this case and tariffs I take 06 months as your staring point. 

15. For the aggravating factors I increase the sentence by 03 months. Now your sentence stands for 09 months imprisonment.

16. Since you have pleaded guilty in the first available instance you are entitled for a reduction of 1/3 of the total period of imprisonment. (Akili Vilimone v State). There by your sentence stands for 06 months. 

17. I reduce further 02 months for other mitigating factors to reach the period of 04 months.

18. In pursuant to section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I am mindful that a sentence which is below two years could be suspended by this court.

19. You are not a first offender. But I note that your last conviction was in 2007.

20. Also I take in to my consideration sec 15(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 

As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part.(Emphasis mine) 

21. Therefore I believe you should be given a final chance to rehabilitate away from a custodial sentence. Accordingly I sentence you to 04 months imprisonment and suspend that for 02 years. 

22. If you commit any crime during that 02 years and found to be guilty by a court you have to serve this prison sentence. 

23 Now I will turn my attention to the complainant in this case. The Domestic Violence Decree of 2009 has specific provisions for these situations. Section 24 (a) (b) (i) of the Decree provides:

(a) Subject to subsection (3) but not withstanding any other provision in this Decree – 

(b) where a person – 

(i) pleads guilty to, or is found guilty of, an offence which is a domestic violence offence;
(ii) the Court must make a domestic violence restraining order under this Decree for the safety and well being of the person against whom the offence or alleged offence was committed;
(iii) where subsection (1) applies the Court need not make an order under this section if satisfied that, having regard to the safety and wellbeing of the person for whose protection the order would be made, the order is not required.

24. Considering the summary of facts in this case I believe I should act under sec 24 of the Domestic Violence Decree of 2009. 

25. Therefore I also grant a permanent Domestic violence restraining order with standard non molestation conditions in favor of the complainant.

26. 28 days to appeal

71671,"JUDGMENT

This is an appeal against conviction and sentence. The appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 5 years.

Statement of Offence

DEFILEMENT OF A GIRL BETWEEN 13 YEARS AND 16 YEARS OF AGE: Contrary to section 156(1)(a) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17. 

Particulars of Offence

DAVID SHIU LINGAM s/o Muthaiya on the 27th day of March, 2004 at Solovi, Nadi in the Western Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl namely PRITIKA MOHINI LATA d/o Suresh Chand being the age of 15 years and 29 days.

The appellant pleaded guilty of the 19th May 2004 before the Nadi Magistrates Court.

The appellant waived his right to counsel and prior to entering his plea was advised of the defence contained in the proviso to section 156(1) of the Penal Code.

The Facts

The accused was charged that on the 27 March 2004 having gone to the house of the victim, in the absence of other members of the household, he asked for iced water and when she went to get it he went to her, held her and hugged her and then took off her clothes and had sexual intercourse with her. On the 3 April 2004 the matter was reported to the Police and the victim was medically examined. The accused when questioned admitted the offence. He admitted having sexual intercourse and admitted knowing at the time of the commission of the offence that the victim was under 16 years of age.

The Medical Report indicated that the victim’s hymen was perforated and that she was sexually active. In 2003 the appellant, who was a carrier driver, transported the victim to school when she was in class 8 in primary school.

The appellant admitted these facts after the Learned Magistrate again made him aware of the provisions of section 156(1) and the possible defence.

The Learned Magistrate asked a series of questions of the appellant: -

“Court: Before I ask you whether you admit facts or not, I would like to refer to few matters.
Firstly, you are made aware of s.156(1)(a) proviso of Penal Code. It is a possible defence if you as accused had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the victim was over the age of 16 years.
Accused: I knew she was under 16 years of age. I took her to school in primary school and children under 16 years go to primary school generally.

Court: I ask you – did you know for sure that she was under 16 years?
Accused: Yes.

Court: Absolutely sure?
Accused: Yes. Her father is my best friend and I know Pritika as primary school child.

Court: I am prepared to adjourn the case to get her birth certificate if you need it and if you feel she is over 16 years?
Accused: No need. I knew she is about 14 or so not 16 yet.

Court: Do you admit facts as outlined by prosecution regarding you defiling her as alleged?
Accused: Yes I do. I loved her and wanted her to be my second wife before she even went to high school.”

Appeal against Conviction

On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that the provisions of section 309 of the Criminal Procedure Code enable the appeal to proceed. This section permits an appeal against conviction only where the legality of the sentence is in issue.

The prior section in similar terms was considered by Grant CJ in Peni Rakorako v R - Cr. Appeal No. 85 of 1978 where with reliance on R v Gyan Deo 22 FLR 1 where he found that the section presupposes that: -

1. the offence is one known to law;
2. the admitted facts substantiate the offence;
3. the accused understood the charge;
4. the accused unequivocally admits his guilt.

The offence is known to law.

The accused admitted having sexual intercourse with the victim and admitted knowing that she was at that time under 16 years of age.

The Learned Magistrate indicated a preparedness to adjourn the proceedings to enable a birth certificate with respect to the accused to be produced. It is apparent from the above quoted record, the appellant declined as he knew her to be under 16. He transported her to school in year 8, primary school. Her father was his best friend and told him her age.

Counsel for the appellant urges that the caution interview shows that the appellant did not know that the accused was under 16 years of age. Clearly, from the answers given to the police officer, this was not so at the time of the commission of the offence with which he was charged.

It is submitted by counsel for the appellant that the prosecution, even where the offence is admitted, must prove the age of the victim and must prove that penetration took place. The authorities relied on do not support this proposition but merely support the obvious, that hearsay evidence of these elements is not sufficient to prove them.

Counsel for the appellant argues that by virtue of Ananaia Naqaqa & Ors v State – HBM0014 of 2000L that the Learned Magistrate erred in failing to invite the prosecution to disclose to the court the contents of the record of interview. The record of interview was tendered to the court on the appeal. It does no more than clearly confirm that the appellant was aware that the victim was under the age of 16 at the time of the offence with which he was charged was committed.

The appellant had knowledge of the age of the accused. The plea of guilty in the circumstances is unequivocal.

The appeal as to conviction must fail.

Appeal against Sentence

The maximum sentence for this offence is 10 years [Penal Code (Penalties) (Amendment) Act 2003]. 

Winter J. considered the relevant authorities in Etonia Rokowaqa v State – Cr. Appeal No. HAA0037 of 2004. He there concluded that since the increase of the maximum sentence to 10 years, the starting point for this offence is 4 years. With this I agree.

The appellant is entitled to a discount for his immediate plea of guilty which would reduce the sentence to 2 ½ years. The appellant had no prior convictions. Warranting a further reduction in sentence to 2 years.

The aggravating factors are that: -

1. the accused is 30 years of age and the victim 15 years of age;

2. the accused is married with 3 children;

3. the accused was a carrier driver driving the victim to school and therefore in a position of trust.

A sentence of 3 years therefore seems appropriate in the circumstances and the sentence of 5 years imposed by the Learned Magistrate is excessive.

Orders

1. Appeal against conviction dismissed.
2. Appeal against sentence allowed.
3. The sentence of 5 years imprisonment is set aside.
4. The appellant is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to date from 19 May 2004.

The appellant was convicted in the Labasa Magistrates' Court for the following offence.

Statement of Offence [a]

RAPE: Contrary to section 149 & 150 of Penal Code Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence [b]

JOHN SAMUEL NAIDU on the 28th day of August, 2009 at Vunivere, Seaqaqa in the Northern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of RAM DEI without her consent.

On his own plea of guilty appellant was convicted, and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He appeals against the said conviction and sentence on the following grounds.

1. The sentence ordered by the trial court is too harsh and excessive in nature.

2. That the petitioner had only been convicted on his guilty plea, and that the summary of facts did not contain evidence of the offence charged for a safe conviction by the trial court.

Ground 1

The offence of Rape carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Offence of Rape is a prevalent offence in Fiji. In this case the age of the victim is 78 years. She is a vulnerable member in the society.

In case of Drotini v State (2006) FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005S (24 march 2006) sentence of 11 years imprisonment, was affirmed for a rape of a step daughter.

In this case the victim is a 78 year old woman and it is a horrendous experience for a woman of that age, and is incapable of resisting such a sexual invasion. Therefore deterrent punishment is justified. The accused deserves much more severe punishment, but he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment as it was the maximum punishment that the Magistrate Court could impose.

Therefore the 1st ground, that the punishment is too harsh and excessive, is without merit.

Ground 2

After the plea of guilty the learned Magistrate convicted the accused Appellant upon admitting the summary of facts. Summary of facts which the accused admitted are filed of record and it contains full facts and elements of the offence of Rape.

The counsel for appellant submitted that the accused did not understand the charge. The learned Magistrate has read and explained the charge to the accused, and the record shows that the accused understood the charge.

When the right to counsel was explained to accused, Appellant had said that he did not need Legal Aid assistance and that he would defend himself.

After pleading guilty to the charge he admitted the summary of facts. The learned Magistrate has followed the correct procedure in dealing with the unrepresented accused. The learned Magistrate was satisfied that the plea of guilty by appellant was unequivocal. I see no reason to interfere with the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. 

Hence appeal against the conviction and the sentence is dismissed.

81969,"SENTENCE

The accused Josateki Lulu has been found guilty and convicted for the offence of rape of Swastika Sharma.

The brief facts of the case were, that the victim Swastika Sharma met her boyfriend Pritesh on 12th March, 2010 after work, and they had an argument, after which Pritesh left. Then Swastika had few drinks with Vikash who was a friend of Pritesh and Vikash dropped her around 12.30am at her driveway to her home.

Then Swastika called Pritesh over the phone and was walking while talking to Pritesh over the phone, to get a taxi to go and meet Pritesh. At that point the accused dragged her to the grass area of the nearby ground, pushed her on to the ground, removed her clothes and forcefully raped her.

Rape is considered a very serious crime and the maximum punishment prescribed in law for the offence of Rape is life imprisonment.

The starting point for sentencing an adult in a rape case without aggravating or mitigating factors, should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years (Kasim v State [1994]] FJCA 25; AAU 0021 j.93S (27 May 1994)).

In Kasims' case the court said:

""While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this Court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point"".

While endorsing the trend in Kasims' case, in Drotini v The State (2006) FJCA 26; AAU0001 2005S (24/March 2006) the court said that the sentencing court should not hesitate to increase the sentence substantially, when there are further aggravating factors.

The aggravating factors in this case are that, the accused used violence against the victim. It was evident that the accused dragged the victim to the ground, pushed her on the ground, pressed his hands on her mouth and then on her neck and raped her.

The force and violence used against the victim can be seen by the injuries which were confirmed by the medical report. She had abrasions all over the body, even grass on her breasts and abrasions around the vaginal opening according to the medical evidence. Therefore this is considered a rape with violence used against the victim.

In mitigation it was said on behalf of the accused, that he is 31 years old, married with one daughter aged 3 years, and an unborn baby who is due to be born in May 2011. He works for the Public Works Department and that he is the sole bread winner of the family. He is a first offender.

Considering the above, I take as starting point, a term of 7 years imprisonment.
For the aggravating factors mentioned above I add further 5 years.

For the mitigating factors mentioned above including that he is a first offender, I reduce 2 years making a total of 10 years imprisonment.

The accused has been on remand custody for this case from 17/3/2010 to 27/4/2010 and again after conviction from 18/3/2011 to 13/4/2011.

Acting in terms of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I reduce further 2 months considering the period in remand custody.

Therefore final sentence for the accused is 9 years and 10 months imprisonment.

Considering the circumstances of the case, I make order that the accused should serve a minimum of 8 years imprisonment period, during which period he is not eligible to be released on parole.

252028,"RULING
 
 
[1] This is a timely application for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence. Following a trial in the High Court at Suva, the appellant was convicted of one count of burglary, one count of sexual assault and two counts of rape. He was sentenced to a total term of 16 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years. 
 
 
[2] The appeal is governed by section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap 12. Under this section, the appellant is required to obtain leave to appeal on any ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact, or fact alone. Section 35(1) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. 12 gives a single judge power to grant leave. The test for leave to appeal against conviction is whether the appeal is arguable (Naisua v State unreported Cr App No CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). Leave is also required to appeal against sentence. The test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether there is an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion (Naisua v State unreported Cr App No CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). On any question of law alone, the appellant may appeal as of right (section 21(1)(a)). 
 
 
[3] The grounds of appeal are:
 
 
 Appeal Against Conviction
 
Ground 1 – The Learned Trial Judge erred in law to shift the burden of prove (sic) to the Appellant to show that the confession was not voluntarily, when he directed the assessors that;
 
 (i) He admitted he first appeared in the Nausori Magistrate (sic) Court on 3 June. He admitted he never complain of any improper police behaviour. He also did not ask the magistrate for any medical examination for any injuries allegedly made by police.

Ground 2 – The learned Trial Judge erred in law when he failed to give a written ruling after the completion of the trial within trial before the principal trial.
 
Ground 3 – The learned Trial Judge erred in law ruling the confession statement as admissible in Voir Dire without providing any analysing of the evidence to demonstrate how he reached to such a conclusion.
 
Ground 4 – The learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact to convict the Appellant for the offence of rape in absence of any medical evidence to prove penetration, compromising his right to fair trial.
 
 
Appeal Against Sentence
 
Ground 5 – The sentence is harsh and excessive in all circumstances of the matter.
 
Ground 6 – The learned Trial Judge erred in law to consider breach of trust as an aggravating factor in absence of any evidence to show that there was a relationship of trust between the Appellant and the victim of alleged crime. 
 
 
[4] At trial, the appellant waived his right to counsel and chose to represent himself. The victim was a 49-year old married woman with grown up children. On the night in question, she was home alone. Her husband was away. At around 9 pm, she was confronted with an intruder inside her bedroom. The bedroom lights were switched off. The intruder was masked. The intruder threatened the victim with a cane knife. She was gagged. Her hands and legs were tied with a piece of cloth and with a tape. She was blindfolded with a piece of cloth, which was taped to her face. Her clothes were removed. She was subjected to various sexual assaults including digital and penile rape. The intruder ejaculated inside her during penile rape. She was left gagged after the intruder left.
 
 
[5] The appellant lived in the same neighbourhood as the victim. The victim’s husband gave evidence that when he was leaving his home on the night of the incident, he met the appellant and told him that he was going to Nakasi and his wife was home alone. When the appellant was arrested, he admitted the offences under caution. At trial, the appellant challenged the admissibility of his confession on the ground that it was extracted from him using force and unfair tactics. The trial judge ruled the confession admissible in a voir dire ruling. The appellant gave evidence. He denied committing the alleged offences. The assessors gave opinions that the appellant was guilty. The trial judge agreed and convicted the appellant. 
 
 
 Burden of proof
 
 
[6] The appellant’s contention that the learned trial judge shifted the burden of proof on the appellant to show that the confession was not made voluntarily has no merit. In paragraph 4 of the summing-up, the learned trial told the assessors that “as a matter of law, the onus or burden of proof rest on the prosecution throughout the trial, and it never shifts to the accused. There is no obligation on the accused to prove his innocence. Under our system of criminal justice, an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.” 
 
 
[7] The trial judge reminded the assessors of the burden of proof at the end of the summing-up in paragraph 30 “Remember, the burden to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution throughout the trial, and it never shifts to the accused, at any stage of the trial. The accused is not required to prove his innocence, or prove anything at all. In fact, he is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt”. In my judgment, the direction on the burden of proof is impeccable. There is no basis to conclude that the trial judge gave an impression that the appellant was required to prove that he made his confession involuntarily. Ground one is unarguable. 
 
 
 Lack of detailed reasons for the voir dire ruling
 
 
[8] The trial judge held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the appellant’s confession. After hearing the evidence on the voir dire, the learned judge ruled the confession admissible on 2 March 2015 and proceeded with the trial. He gave written reasons for his decision on 6 March 2015, the date the sentence was delivered and the case was concluded. Counsel for the appellant submits that the practice of admitting the disputed confession into evidence after a voir dire and giving reasons later during the trial was irregular. This Court is not aware of any authority that says that such a practice is irregular. Ground two is unarguable.
 
 
[9] The trial judge’s written reasons were brief. After referring to the relevant principles, the trial judge came to the following conclusion:
 
 
I have heard all the evidence. I accept the prosecution's witnesses evidence as credible, I accept what they said. I rule that the accused's caution interview statements and charge statements are admissible evidence, and their acceptance or otherwise will be a matter for the assessors.
 
 
[10] The appellant’s contention is that the trial judge had not analyzed the evidence in the voir dire ruling. Central to the issue of admissibility was the credibility of the appellant and the police officers. The police officers denied using force or unfair tactics to extract the confession from the appellant. The appellant’s evidence was that they did. The trial judge believed the police officers and ruled the appellant’s confession admissible. The trial judge was indeed economical with his reasons. I do not think he made an error by being economical with his reasons. Such a course was approved by the Court of Appeal in Ganga Ram v R (46 of 1983) where it said: 
 
 
Accordingly we wish to say that it has always been thought desirable that findings adverse to an accused person, if they must be pronounced during the course of a trial, should be as economically worded as possible. 
 
 
[11] Further, in Deo v Reginam [1984] FijiLawRp 4; [1984] 30 FLR 31 (24 November 1984) it was held that the learned trial Judge was correct in his ruling on the admissibility of the confessions, of doing so briefly without going into the details of the evidence. Similar pronouncement was made by the Privy Council in Wallace and Others v The Queen (Jamaica) [1996] UKPC 47 (3rd December, 1996). For these reasons, ground three is unarguable. 
 
 
Medical evidence
 
 
[12] At trial, the prosecution led no medical evidence. But the medical report of the victim was disclosed to the appellant. The appellant’s contention that the medical evidence should have been led is devoid of merit. This Court has no jurisdiction to consider evidence that was not led at the trial. Ground four is unarguable. 
 
 
 Breach of trust
 
 
[13] The appellant’s contention is that the trial judge was wrong to consider the breach of trust as an aggravating factor because the appellant was not related to the victim. I accept that the victim was not related to the appellant, but there was evidence that both lived in the same settlement and the appellant occasionally visited the victim’s home to drink kava with her husband. There was evidence of trust arising from the friendship between the appellant and the victim’s husband, and that trust was breached when the appellant raped his friend’s wife. 
 
 
 Whether the sentence is harsh and excessive?
 
 
[14] Apart from the breach of trust, there were many aggravating factors:
 
  
• The victim was raped in the safety of her own home.
 
• The incident happened at night time when the victim was alone and vulnerable.
 
• The appellant was masked to hide his identity.
 
• The victim was threatened with a cane knife.
 
• The victim was gagged – hands, legs tied and taped, face blindfolded and taped.
 
• The appellant ejaculated inside the victim – thus exposing the victim to pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. 
 

[15] In my judgment, the sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment reflects the criminality involved. There is no arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
 
 
Result
 
 
[16] Leave refused.

271680,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Gates, P
  
• I have read in draft the judgment of Hettige J. I agree with His Lordship’s conclusions and reasons and with the proposed orders for dismissal.
 

Sathyaa Hettige, J
 
  
• This is an application for Special Leave to appeal against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Calanchini P, Jayamanne JA and P. Fernando JA) dated 27th May, 2016, affirming the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner by the High Court at Suva.
 
 
• The petitioner was charged with one count of Indecent Assault contrary to section 154 (1) of the Penal Code Cap. 17 for unlawfully and indecently assaulting Raijeli Katarina between 1st day and 31st January 2010 at Kuku, Bau in the Central Division and the petitioner was charged with a second count of Indecent Assault on Raijeli Katarina between 1st February 2010 and 14th May 2010 at Kuku , Bau in the Central Division contrary to section 212 (1) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.The petitioner was charged with one count of rape in that the petitioner had carnal knowledge of Raijeli Katarina on 15th May 2010 at Kuku, Bau Tailevu in the Central Division without her consent contrary to section 207 (1) and section 207 (2) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. On the second count of rape contrary to section 207 (1) and section 207 (2) of the Crimes Decree 2009 the petitioner was charged with having carnal Knowledge of Raijeli Katarina without her consent at Kuku, Bau, Tailevu in the Central Division between 1st August 2010 and 31st August 2011. 
 
 
• Following a trial which lasted for 4 days in the High Court at Suva on all four counts, the trial Judge convicted the petitioner on a unanimous verdict of guilty of the assessors in respect of each count against the petitioner on 20th August 2012.
 
 
• The learned trial Judge sentenced the petitioner on 24th August 2012 as follows:
  
• (1) Two and half years imprisonment on each of the indecent assault convictions 


 14 Years of imprisonment on each of the rape convictions.
 
 
The trial Judge ordered all the sentences to be served concurrently. The petitioner was sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment with a non–parole period of 12 years effective from 24th August, 2012. 
 
  
• The petitioner being dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court sought leave to appeal before a single Judge of the Court of Appeal against the conviction and sentence and the petitioner’s application for leave was dismissed by the single Judge of the Court of Appeal on 30 September 2015 on the basis that none of the grounds of appeal against the conviction and the sentence appeal was arguable.
 
 
• The petitioner filed on the 5th October 2015 a letter seeking to renew his leave to appeal application under section 35 (3) of the Court of  Appeal Act. The Full Court of Appeal after hearing the renewed application for leave on fresh grounds of appeal made by the petitioner dismissed the appeal against the conviction and sentence on 27th May 2016.
 
 
• The petitioner seeks leave to appeal before the Supreme Court under section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act of 1998 on the following grounds of appeal contained in a petition which was received in the Registry of the Supreme Court on 8th July 2016.
  
• (i) That the Court of Appeal erred in law in not properly addressing the grounds of appeal.
 
 
• (ii) That the Court Appeal erred in law in holding that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice and thereby applying the provision to 23 of the Court of Appeal Act despite earlier findings merits in the petitioner’s grounds which relates to the paucity of directions on the recent complaint as per paragraph 16 and 25 of the impugned judgment.
 
 
• (iii) That the Court of Appeal erred in law in wrongly purporting to overrule or not follow the recent Supreme court ruling in Praveen Ram CAV001/2011 and in particular the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Suresh Chandra v State CAV 21/2015 where the court in that instance endorsed the principles in Ram, in view of the petitioner’s initial complaint that the trial Judge did not properly and/or independently assess the evidence after the verdict of the assessors.
 
 
• (iv) The Court of Appeal thereby erred in holding in paragraph 30 that Ram must be read in a manner that is consistent with the provision of 237 of the CPD in light of the overriding provision in section 98 of 2013 Constitution , the Supreme Court , sub section 7, binding on all other courts of the State. 
 

 
• However, according to the appeal submissions filed by the petitioner dated 14th September 2016 the main grounds of appeal can be limited to the following:
  
• (i) The Fiji Court of Appeal erred in law when it did not consider the issue of non direction on the inconsistent statement of the complainant during the trial and lack of direction on recent complaint evidence.
 
 
• (ii) The petitioner alleges the lack of reasoning and independent evaluation of evidence by the learned trial Judge after the verdict of the assessors were given. 
 

 
•  It is relevant to consider the facts briefly in this case before dealing with the grounds of appeal of the petitioner.
 

BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
  
• The female complainant was born on 24th July 1994. She was the child of the petitioner’s wife’s younger sister. She was the niece of the petitioner by marriage. In December 2009 she lived with her relatives in Nadi. She was 15 and half years old at that time. Her parents were residing in the United States. In January 2010 it was discovered that she was 4 - 5 months pregnant. The petitioner and his wife offered to take her to village at Kuku and look after her and her child. The petitioner and his wife accordingly agreed to allow her to stay with them. Shortly after the petitioner’s family returned to Kuku village in Tailevu with the victim in January 2010 she became a part of the family. As soon as the victim arrived in the petitioner’s house at Kuku village the petitioner started to abuse her by fondling her breasts, body and kissing her in the neck and mouth. The petitioner repeatedly abused her on numerous occasions between January and May in 2010. The complainant alleged in her evidence further that the petitioner continued to rape her when the petitioner’s wife and his daughter were away from the house.
 

The victim alleged in her evidence that the petitioner raped her on the previous day of the birth of the child and one week after the child’s birth. The petitioner continued to rape the complainant twice a week without her consent thereafter until she left the house in August 2011 as she was fed up and could not take it any further. The victim stated that she told her aunty on at least, two occasions but she did not believe what she told her. It was revealed in the course of her evidence that she was treated like a “house-girl”. She also admitted under cross-examination that she was hit by the petitioner with a stick. 
 
  
• According to the above facts and evidence elicited at the trial, it must be stated that the offence of rape involved in this case is a serious one. It is a worst form of sexual assault on the complainant. The victim had to undergo the trauma for a long period of time during her stay in the petitioner’s house in Kuku village. 
 
 
• It is also important to refer to the agreed facts before considering the grounds of appeal.
 

The following facts were agreed on 28 June 2012 by the prosecution and the defence in terms of section 135 of the Criminal Procedure Decree No. 43 of 2009.
 
  
• That the victim Raijeili Katarina was the accused’s niece.
 
• That the victim fell pregnant and came to live with the accused and his wife.
 
• That the victim resided with the accused and his wife at their home in Kuku Village, Bau Road during the time of the alleged offending.
 
• That the victim resided with the accused family until giving birth.
 

It is pertinent to state that the agreed facts are admissions and they are sufficient proof of the facts admitted and there is no legal requirement to prove them.
 
 
GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
  
• We will deal with the main grounds of appeal as stated in paragraph 8 above based on the submissions of the petitioner. The main grounds of appeal on inconsistencies of statements and recent complaint issue as contained in the appeal submissions are dealt with based on the material and all the submissions made by both parties. We observe that the Court of Appeal has carefully discussed the above grounds of appeal in paragraphs 13, 14, and 15 of the judgment and reached the correct conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice or unfair trial.
 

 INCONSISTENCIES OF STATEMENT
 
  
• The contents in Paragraph 14 is reproduced as follows:

“ (14) To the extent that there were inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence , it must not be forgotten that at the time when the offences commenced the complainant was 15 and half years old and pregnant. She had been offered and accepted accommodation during her confinement and following the birth of her son. The trial was over two years later by which time the complainant had turned 18.. It should not be surprising that her memory of the details of events that had occurred at a time when she was extremely vulnerable were inconsistent during the course of her evidence and cross-examination . Her evidence on the elements of the offences were entirely consistent throughout the trial. In my judgment there were no material inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence that would require comment by the learned Judge in his summing up. (Emphasis added)
 
  
• We also observe that even though there are some inconsistencies in relation to the medical report when the complainant told the doctor that she was hit by the petitioner with a rope having previously claimed that she was hit with a stick, the evidence of the complainant was consistent with the elements of the offences of rape and indecent assault with which the petitioner was charged. 
 
 
• However, we find that the learned trial Judge in his summing up at paragraphs 26 and 31 has correctly directed the assessors on the issue of credibility of the complainant as a witness.
 

Paragraph 26 states as follows:
 
“As assessors and judges of fact your decision in this case , will largely depend on how you decided on the credibility of the complainant as against the accused, as a witness. In other words, after observing the two give evidence from the witness box and watching their behavior and general demeanour in the court room , and given your general experience as members of the community , who do you find as more credible of the two witnesses. Your answer to this question will determine your answer to the questions posed in paragraph 8 hereof.” 
 
 
And in paragraph 31 the learned trial judge left it entirely to the Assessors to decide whether or not to accept the complainant’s evidence.
 
  
• It is important to mention that there is no evidence or any indication that the complainant was cross-examined on the issue of inconsistencies and in fact when this matter was heard court posed this question on the inconsistencies of statements of the complainant to the counsel who represented the petitioner and he admitted that the issue on inconsistency of statement was never raised in the trial court. As such there does not appear to be any error on the part of the trial Judge to give any direction to the assessors. (Sudhakar v The State AAU 105 of 2010) (5/12/2015) It was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioner was represented by a counsel during the trial proper and none of the material inconsistencies were cross-examined and challenged by the defending counsel. If the witness was not cross-examined on the inconsistencies the petitioner cannot raise that issue on appeal. (Per Lord Morris in Browne v Dunn H.L. (1893) R 6. 67 P). 
 

 RECENT COMPLAINT 
  
  
• The petitioner has urged in the next ground of appeal that the learned Judge failed to direct the assessors on belatedness of the complaint made to the police. The reason for not making a timely complaint to the police was obvious. The victim was treated like a “house-girl and she was under the direct control of the petitioner in the house. She was only 15 and half years old. The complainant, immediately after leaving the petitioner’s house duly complained to relatives in Nadi and the police after the confinement. The learned trial Judge adequately addressed this issue in his summing up.
 

In Jonkers v Police (1996) 67 SASR 401 Matheson J observed the following on recent complaint.
 
“The authorities establish that a complaint can be recent and admissible, although it may not have been made at the first opportunity which presented itself. What is the first reasonable opportunity will depend on the circumstances including the character of the complainant and relationship between the complainant and to whom she complained and the persons to whom she might have complained did not do so.” 
 
  
• It is to be noted that the complainant in fact had told the neighbor Ms Vadei about what happened to her and that the petitioner was troubling her and the trial Judge has referred to it in his summing up. The neighbor, Ms.Vadei testified in court and confirmed that the victim was raped by the petitioner. In paragraph 27 of the summing up at page 71 of the SC Record learned trial Judge directed the assessors as follows:
 

“Ms Vadei said, she lived in a home which was three footsteps away from the accused’s family house in Kuku village. She said she knew the accused’s family and the complainant well, and she got on well with them. She said she resided in Kuku village from 2009 to 2011. She said the complainant normally shared things with her. She recalled the complainant coming to her one day and complained that the accused’s family was making her work hard. She also said she was crying at the time and she told her that Livai was touching her and having sex with her . She said Livai beat her, and she was showing her bruises on her leg. She said she cried with her. As assessors and Judges of fact, you must consider this evidence carefully. It does not prove truth of what the complainant alleged against the accused, but it does tend to prove what was occupying the complainant’s mind and her general demeanour, at the time, she confided in Ms Vadei. It is evidence which you will have to consider , with other evidence , when you deliberate in the case.” It is the credibility of the complainant when giving evidence that has to be considered. We conclude that the grounds of appeal on inconsistency of statement and on issue of recent complaint fail and should be refused due to lack of merit.
 
 
TRIAL JUDGE’S FAILURE TO ASSESS THE EVIDENCE INDEPENDENTLY
 
  
• This ground of appeal is a fresh ground which was not raised in the Court of Appeal. This court is not inclined to make any observations on this ground of appeal as the Court of Appeal did not have the opportunity to look into issue raised by the petitioner. However, we observe that the trial Judge has given proper directions to the assessors on each aspect of evidence and the law in his summing up. 
 
 
• It can be seen from a line of authorities in Fiji and other jurisdictions that the Supreme Court has been reluctant and have refused to excise its jurisdiction in allowing the new points to be taken up or to be argued in the Apex court if the new point had not been argued in the court below.

As such, we refuse and dismiss leave to appeal on this ground of appeal.
 
 
LEAVE TO APPEAL BEFORE SUPREME COURT 
 
  
• The petitioner’s application for leave to appeal is subject to the threshold criteria specifically contained in section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act No. 14 of 1998 which reads as follows:-
 

(2) In relation to a criminal matter, the Supreme Court must not grant special leave to appeal unless-
 
(a) A question of general legal importance is involved;
 
(b) A substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved; or
 
(c) Substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur.
 
  
• In Dip Chand v State CAV0014/2012 (9 May 2012) the Supreme Court observed as follows:

 “ Given that the criteria set out in section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act No. 14 of 1998 are extremely stringent, and special leave to appeal is not granted as a matter of course, the fact that the majority of the grounds relied upon by the petitioner for special leave to appeal have not been raised in the Court of Appeal makes the task of the petitioner of crossing the threshold requirements for special leave even more difficult.”
 
  
• It is manifestly clear from the above provisions contained in the section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act special leave should not be granted as a matter of course. The Supreme Court in Aminiasi Katonivualiku v State (2003) FJSC Crim. App. No. CAV0001/1999S, 17th April 2003 clarified the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court at page 3 as follows:

“It is plain from this provision that the Supreme Court is not a Court of criminal appeal or general review nor is there an appeal to the Court as a matter of right and , whilst we accept in an application for special leave some elaboration on the grounds of appeal may have to be entertained, the Court is necessarily confined within the legal parameters set out above, to an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal which in this instance, was an order for a new trial.”
 
  
• It is to be noted that the above passage in Aminiasi case (supra) was cited with approval in subsequent Supreme Court decisions such as Raura v The State (2006) FJSC 4; CAV0010U. 2005S (4th May 2006), and Chand v The State (2012) FJSC6; CAV14/2010 (9th May 2012).
 
 
• As stated above the stringent threshold criteria in section 7 of the Supreme Court has been discussed and decided in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of Fiji. See Bulu v Housing Authority (2005) FJSC 1 CBV 0011.2004S 8 April 2005. 
 
 
• It can be observed that from the above decisions that special leave is not granted unless the case is one involving a matter of public interest , or some important question of law.
 
 
• The extra-ordinary power of the Supreme Court in Fiji will be exercised under section 7(2) of the Supreme Court in its discretion, only if the threshold criteria encapsulated therein is met by a petitioner notwithstanding the right of appeal granted to an aggrieved party to seek special leave.
 
 
• Chandra, J
 

I agree with the reasons and conclusions of His Lordship Hettige, J.
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
  
• In considering the facts and evidence and written submissions of both the petitioner and the State Counsel in this case both in the trial court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court we do not find that the Court of Appeal had fallen into any error as alleged by the petitioner and there is no miscarriage of justice suffered by the petitioner. We also do not find that the petitioner has sustained any substantial and grave injustice. The petitioner has failed to satisfy the threshold requirements contemplated in section 7 (2) of the Supreme Court Act of 1998 and in the result the petitioner has failed to satisfy us on any of the grounds of appeal urged before this court and we reach the conclusion that the petitioner’s application should be dismissed.
 
 
• For the reasons set out above this court in exercising its extra ordinary power under section 98 (3) of the Constitution would not be justified in granting special leave to appeal in this case
 
 
• Accordingly, we make the following orders :
  
• Leave to appeal application is refused.
 
 
• The Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 27th May 2016 is affirmed.

SIXTH COUNT
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (c) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
ALBERT HERBERT VALENTINE, between the 24th day of April 2015 and the 11th day of May 2015, in Qamea, in the Northern Division penetrated the outh of C.F.V., a child under the age of 13 years, with his penis.
 
  
• The prosecution presented the following summary of facts:
 

""The Accused in this matter is Albert Herbert Valentine, aged 36 years, in 2015. He has been charged for five counts of Rape and one count of Sexual Assault.
 
 
On the 27th day of June 2015, in Qamea in the Northern Division, the Accused, the 5 years old niece of the Accused was playing outside of his house. The Accused told the 5 year old child, L.V. to go inside the house and change into a skirt and return to play. The child went and changed into a skirt and went back. When the Accused saw her return wearing a skirt, he told her to accompany him inside his house. There he took the child to his bed, took her under the bed covers and lifted her skirt, parted her legs and her panty and inserted his tongue into her vagina, by licking. Thereafter, the Accused took his penis and penetrated it inside the mouth of the 5 years old child and told the child to swallow his semen.
 
 
Before the above date, that is between the 15th of June 2015 and the 25 of June 2015, the Accused called his cousin who was 9 years old, G. L, into his house. When she entered his house, the Accused took her into his room. He then lay her on the bed and removed her panty. He then inserted his tongue into her vagina by licking. Thereafter, he proceeded to rub his penis on her vagina and thereby indecently and unlawfully assaulted her.
 
 
Prior to that incident, between the 24th day of April and the 11th day of May 2015, the Accused had visited his 7 year old cousin, C.F.V. and her parents. As they were alone in the house, the Accused called C.F.V. into the sitting room, he was lying facing upwards. He told the 7 year old to come and sit around his face area. In that way his mouth was directly in line with her vaginal area and he then proceeded to insert his tongue into her vagina by licking. Thereafter, he proceeded to penetrate his penis into her mouth.""
 
 
3. The court then checked with your counsel to see whether or not you had admitted to all the elements of ""rape"" and 'sexual assault"" in counts no. 1 to 6. Through your counsel, you said that you admitted all the particulars of offences in counts no. 1 to 6, and that you agreed with the prosecution's summary of facts. Through your counsel, you admitted all the elements of ""rape"" in counts no. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and the elements of ""sexual assault"" in count no. 4. As a result of the above, the court found you guilty as charged on all counts and convicted you on all counts.
 
 
4. ""Rape"" is always treated seriously by our lawmakers and it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Honorable Chief Justice via the Supreme Court case of Anand Ahay Raj v The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. CAV 0003 of 2014, has set the tariff for the rape of juveniles a sentence between 10 to 16 years imprisonment.
 
 
5. For ""sexual assault"" the maximum sentence is a sentence at 10 years imprisonment. In The State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca, Criminal Case No. HAC 252 of 2011, High Court, Suva, His Lordship Justice Paul Madigan set the tariff at a sentence between 2 to 8 years imprisonment. The more serious the assault, the higher the sentence will be. Of course, the final sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors. 
 
 
6. In this case, the aggravating factors were as follows:
 
 
(i) Breach of Trust. The three child complainants were related to the accused. Complainant no. 1 was 5 years old, and the accused was her uncle. The second complainant was 9 years old, and the accused was her cousin. Likewise, the third complainant was 7 years old, and the accused was her cousin. The accused was 36 years old. The age difference between the complainants and the accused was large, and in a sense, he stood in a position of trust to them. As an elder and relative, his responsibility to the complainants was to see that no-one abused them. Yet he was the very one that abused them sexually. As such, he abused the trust the complainants had in him;
 
 
(ii) The rape of children. Raping children is a despicable crime. It is a direct attack on the most vulnerable in our society. Children are the future of this country, and it is the duty of the court to pass severe sentences on those that attack them sexually, as a deterrence to others. You must not complain when your liberty is taken away to pay for your crimes;
 
 
(iii) By offending against the three child complainants, you showed no regard to their human rights and dignity.
 
  
• The mitigating factors were as follows:
 

(i) At the age of 36 years, this is your first offence;
 
(ii) Although you pleaded guilty to the charges 2 months 5 days after first call in the High Court, you nevertheless saved the court's time, and the need for the three child complainants to re-live their ordeal in the courtroom, by giving evidence;
 
(iii) You had been remanded in custody for 2 months 17 days, since 1 July 2015.
 
(iv) You fully co-operated with the police during their investigation, and you admitted the offence when caution interviewed;
 
(v) You are remorseful, as shown by your early guilty plea.
 
 
8. On count no. 1 (rape), I start with a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 18 years imprisonment. For pleading guilty to the offence, I deduct 3 years from the 18 years total. I make another 1 year deduction for being a first offender. I deduct another 3 months for time already served while remanded in custody. I deduct another 9 months for being remorseful. I deduct another 1 year for co-operation with police. Total deduction is 6 years from 18 years, leaving a balance of 12 years imprisonment. On count no. 1 (rape), I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
9. I repeat the above process and sentence for the other rape counts, that is, counts no. 2, 3, 5 and 6.
 
 
10. As for count no. 4 (sexual assault), I sentence you to 6 years imprisonment.
 
  
• The summary of your sentences are as follows:
 

(i) Count no. 1 - Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 
(ii) Count no. 2 - Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 
(iii) Count no. 3 - Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 
(iv) Count no. 4 - Sexual Assault - 6 years imprisonment.
 
 (v) Count no. 5 - Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 (vi) Count no. 6 - Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 

12. Because of the principle of totality of sentencing, I direct that all the above sentences are to be made concurrent to each other, that is, a final total sentence of 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
13. Mr. Albert Herbert Valentine, for raping and sexually assaulting the three child complainants, between 24 April and 27 June 2015, at Qamea in the Northern Division, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
14. The name of the three child complainants are permanent suppressed to protect their privacy.

• Apenisa Raileqe, you stand convicted of the following offence;
 

Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) and (3) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
APENISA RAILEQE, between the 12th of August, 2017 and 27th of August, 2017 at Nadaro Village, in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of LG, who is a child under the age of 13 years old.
 
  
• At the time of offence the victim was 07 years old and you were 42 years old. You are the victim’s father’s elder brother where she calls you ‘Ta levu’. You raped the victim by inserting your penis inside her vagina in her own house. As a result the victim had sustained injuries in her genitalia.
 
 
• Being the victim’s father’s elder brother it was expected of you to be a protector of the victim. You on the other hand became her predator and exploited her when her parents were away. By your decision to renounce the basic moral values a human being of your standard is expected to possess, you have brought discredit to all the Tata Levus and in general to all adult males in our society. In fact, in this case, it is submitted in the victim impact statement that your conduct had led not only the victim but also her parents to lose the trust on the [male] family members.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 207(1) of the Crimes Act 2009 (“Crimes Act”) read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”), the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of a child victim is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors in this case; 
• There is a serious breach of trust;
 
• The age gap between you and the victim which is 35years;
 
• The victim sustained physical injuries as a result of your conduct; and
 
• You exploited the victim’s vulnerability.
 

 
• The only mitigating factor available to you is the fact that you are a first offender.
 
 
• I select 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence. Considering the above aggravating factors I would add 07 years to your sentence and would deduct 2 years in view of the fact that you are a first offender.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to a term of 15 years imprisonment. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 13 years of your sentence in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 
 
• It was submitted that you were in custody since 19/09/2017. The period you have been held in custody shall be considered as a period of imprisonment already served by you in terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 07 months.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 15 years with a non-parole period of 13 years. In view of the time spent in custody, time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 14 years and 05 months
 
Non-parole period – 12 years and 05 months
 
  
• Having considered the facts of this case, a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order is issued against you, identifying the victim ‘LG’ as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any form of contact with the victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

73577,"SENTENCE

	1.	You are charged as follows:

First Count
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and 2 (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

OTETI SIVOINATOTO between September 2010 and May 2011 at Lautoka in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of MN without her consent.

Second Count
Statement of Offence

ABORTION: Contrary to Section 234 (1) and 4 (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

OTETI SIVOINATOTO between April 2011 and August 2011 at Lautoka in the Western Division did an act on MN, with intent to procure abortion.

	1.	When the case was taken up for trial on 24.3 2014 accused pleaded guilty to the 2nd count of abortion and admitted the summary of facts on 25.3.2014.

	2.	Summary of facts for the second count are as follows:
Sometimes in March 2011, the complainant (MN) was not having her mensus. At the time, she was staying with the accused (Mr Oteti Sivoinatoto) at Bandila Crescent, Rifle Range in Lautoka. The complainant then told the accused (Mr Oteti Sivoinatoto) sometimes in April 2011 and August 2011 that her mensus were not coming and she thought that she was pregnant. The accused then gave the complainant rum which was mixed with milk for the complainant to drink to abort the baby. The complainant drank and nothing happened.

On the following day, the complainant after returning from school, the accused mixed her a strong tea to drink to abort the baby but it was again unsuccessful. On another occasion sometimes in April 2011 and August 2011, the accused gave the complainant two (2) raw eggs to drink to abort the baby.

The matter was reported to the Police and he was charged for Abortion contrary to Section 234 (1) (4) (b) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The accused was then cautioned interviewed by the Police and he admits to giving various things to the Complainant to drink in order to abort the baby, but those attempts failed.

	1.	After carefully considering your Plea for the 2nd count to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for Abortion contrary to Section 234 (1) and 4 (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

	2.	After trial, the majority of the assessors found you Guilty for the Rape count. One assessor found you Guilty for Defilement.

	3.	I concurred with the majority verdict and found you guilty for the 1st count of Rape.

	4.	Following facts were revealed in the evidence. That in 2010 in one night accused had come to complainant's room wearing a towel. Accused had undressed her and inserted his penis into her vagina. It was painful and she had started crying. She had tried to move but accused was holding her. She did not consent to sexual intercourse at anytime. She had not reported the matter to Police as the accused used to threaten her with a knife and slap her. 

	5.	Accused Oteti Sivoinatoto you stand convicted for one count of Rape and one count of abortion.

	6.	The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates (as then he was) in State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.

	7.	In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed: 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

	1.	The tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 15 years. 

	2.	In State v Mario Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""

In this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter.

	1.	In State v Anthony [2012] FJHC 1013; HAC 151.2010 Hon. Mr. Justice Priynatha Nawana held that:

""The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl of MB's standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in case of this nature, deterrence is therefore, of paramount importance."" 

	1.	It was held further by Hon. Mr. Justice Priynatha Nawana that:

""The accused had not shown any remorse or repentance. On the contrary, he relentlessly castigated the witnesses saying that they were making up a false allegation at the expense of the little girl to avenge an unsubstantiated previous incident of refusing a loan to MB's mother. This added, in my view, insult to the injury. While court recognizes that the accused was entitled to advance any proposition in support of his case, court equally recognizes that it should show its displeasure by showing no mercy in the matter of sentence when such allegations are found to be totally ill-founded as in this case.""

	1.	Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment for the charge of Rape.

	2.	Aggravating factors;
		(a) The victim was of a younger and tender age,
		(b) You completely breached the trust shared between you and the victim,
		(c) Victim was subjected to more than one sexual act,
		(d) You had made the victim sexually active at a young age,
		(e) You had traumatized the life of the victim.

Considering all, I increase your sentence by 3 years now the sentence is 14 years 
imprisonment.

	1.	Mitigating circumstances:
		(a) You are first offender at the age of 64 years,
		(b) You seek forgiveness from this court.
Considering above, I reduce 1 year from your sentence now your sentence is 13 years imprisonment.

	1.	Considering section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 10 years as non parole period.

	2.	The maximum sentence for the second charge is 25 years.

	3.	There is no set tariff for the offence.

	4.	In State v Mudaliar [2006] FJHC 47; HAC 015.2005S (17 May 2006) Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates (as he then was) ordered a sentence of 3 years imprisonment for a specialist obstetrician who carried out an abortion. However, this conviction and sentence was later set aside by the Supreme Court and a re-trial was ordered.

	5.	In Devi v State [1992] FJHC 30; [1992] 38 FLR 94 (3 June 1992) a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for manslaughter for death following illegal abortion was suspended for 2 years by the Court of Appeal after serving 5 months.

	6.	I take a starting point of 2 years and add 2 years for the aggravating factors including the age of the victim, nature of relationship between you and victim and the repeated attempts of abortion. I deduct 1 year for the mitigation mentioned above. Another 1 year to be deducted for the Guilty plea and the final sentence is 2 years for the 2nd count.

	7.	Your sentences are as follows: 
		(i) 1st count of Rape - 13 years 
		(ii) 2nd count of Abortion - 2 years

	8.	The Fiji Court of Appeal in Vukitoga v State [2013] FJCA 19; AAU 0049.2008 (13 March 2013) cited with approval the following citation of D.A. Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (2nd edition, 1979) p. 56-57 which was cited in High Court of Australia judgment Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70:

""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong'; ""when... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behavior and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.""

	1.	Considering the totality principle, I order the sentences for both charges to run concurrently.

Summary

	1.	You are sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for the 1st count of Rape and 2 years imprisonment for the 2nd count of abortion. Both sentences to run concurrently. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 10 years of imprisonment.

	2.	Having considered the nature of the relationship you had with the victim, I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) in place, identifying victim MN as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any contact with the victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.

	3.	30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

	1.	Mr. Pita Tiqatabua, stands convicted before this court for the following four counts of Attempted Rape contrary to Section 151 of the Penal Code, Cap 17 and Section 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. The particulars of the offences are as follows;

Count 1:
On the 23rd day of December 2009, at Vatuwaqa in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of Ms. T, without her consent.
Count 2:
On the 19th day of January 2010, at Vatuwaqa in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of Ms. T, without his/her consent.
Count 3:
On the 26th day of January 2010, at Vatuwaqa in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of Ms. T, without her consent.
Count 4:
On the 22nd day of December 2010, at Vatuwaqa in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of Ms. T, without her consent.

	1.	It was only after a full Hearing, listening to all the prosecution witnesses, as well as the accused, this court deliberated that Mr. Pita Tiqatabua is guilty of all 4 counts of Attempted Rape. The detailed analysis of evidence is being reflected in the Judgment, pronounced in open court on 14th January 2013.

	2.	The maximum penalty for the offence of Attempted Rape contrary to Section 151 of the Penal Code and Section 208 of the Crimes Decree attract a maximum period of 10 years imprisonment. It was decided in Jolame Nokonokomoli v State HAA 23 of 2009 that the tariff for the offence of Attempted Rape should be between 12 months to 5 years imprisonment. In the case of Aunima v The State [2001] FJHC 294; [2001] 1FLR 213 dated 27th June 2001 Shameem J re-confirmed the tariff for the offence of Attempted Rape is to lie between 12 months to 5 years imprisonment.

	3.	Keeping the legal precedents in mind I take a starting point of 42 months of imprisonment (3 ½ years) for each count.

	4.	It was revealed in the course of the Hearing that the accused is a relative of the victim as the victim calls the accused ""grandfather"". Both parties were living in the same settlement in close by barracks. The accused was almost 40 years of age while the victim was 12 years at the time of the commission of the offence. As the learned Prosecutor correctly pointed out, the conduct of the accused is a clear reflection of gross breach of trust where a civilized society would not anticipate such behaviour from a person with this age difference while being related to the victim. It was quite evident that the accused was using his authority of age and relationship to get the control over the victim. Being 12 years of age, it is obvious that the victim is so vulnerable. At the same time, I note that the alleged offences had continued for almost 1 year on four different occasions and that is a clear indication of as to how the accused maximized the opportunity of abusing the victim whenever the opportunity comes in his way. Until the accused and the victim were caught red-handed by another child in close vicinity (Eparama), the victim was kept in the dark and in fear not to divulge her bitter experiences to anybody because of the authority and the force of the accused. Adding salt to the injury, it makes things worse when the sexual activities were tried to be compensated with some ""Sun-Pops"" or a $1.00 coin or a packet of noodles. The above stated factors will aggravate the background with which the accused is being charged with.

	5.	In mitigation the following grounds were urged by the accused;
		* Apologizes to court.
		* Remorseful for his actions and deeds.
		* States that these offences were totally out of character.
		* Remand Centre has been a very salutary lesson and he is determined to lead a new life away from crime.
		* Low level of violence used with no injuries to the victim, though there were threats.

	6.	Accused is a security officer of 42 years of age. He is married with 4 children and his schooling children and elderly parents are dependent on him. It is rather interesting to note that though the accused who initially challenged the charges leveled against him and went for a full Hearing, had taken a topsy-turvy by admitting himself in mitigation that he is remorseful for his actions and deeds, the offences are totally out of character, he learnt his lessons and determined to lead a crime free life. Paster Leveni Sovatavua of Apostle Church in Nabua was also called on behalf of the ""accused to offer character evidence"". Pastor testified to the effect that the accused was an honest man while he was working with him in church and he was surprised to hear about this case. But he admitted that he knows the victim girl also and he has not come across any of her dishonest acts as well. Since the court has already decided to place its reliance on the victim girl, upon listening to her testimony, I am not going to take into consideration what the Pastor said about the victim.

	7.	For all the above stated aggravating factors I add 12 months imprisonment to the starting point. Having considered the mitigatory factors, inclusive of the testimony of Pastor Leveni, I reduce 6 months form the total. You did not plead guilty to the charges without going for a Hearing. Therefore, you are not entitled to a reduction for an early guilty plea and on the other hand it's an indication of the ""true colours"" of your ""remorse"". The outcome of that was the victim being still a small girl coming to the witness box and recalling all her bitter experiences.

	8.	With the above mathematical arrangement, your final sentence remains at 48 months imprisonment for each count. As the case record reflects that you had been in remand at least since 24th of January 2011 to 8th of March 2011 in relation to this case and that is around 1 ½ months. Thus, I order that 1 ½ months be reduced from your sentence of 4 years imprisonment for each count and therefore it will come down to 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks imprisonment.

	9.	Further, I note that you have been in remand custody since 14th January 2013, the day this court pronounced your conviction. Hence, I order your sentence of 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks for each count to be commenced from 14th of January 2013.

	10.	Finally, I order the sentence of 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks for each count to run concurrently from 14th of January 2013.

• Peni Bulago, you stand convicted of one count of sexual assault under section 210(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
• According to the evidence, you rubbed a banana on top of the victim’s genitalia on one night in 2012. You are the victim’s maternal grandfather. This incident took place when the victim was living in your house at Kalabu. Victim’s parents were living at Lautoka. At the time of offence, the victim was below the age of 13 years.
 
 
• The offence of sexual assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012), this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault.
 
 
• I take 2 years as the starting point of your sentence.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• The victim was under your care and your protection when you sexually assaulted her. There is a serious breach of trust; 
 
• age difference between you and the victim is 52 years; and
 
• you took advantage of the victims naivety and vulnerability. 
 

 
• According to the previous conviction report filed by the prosecution, you have 15 previous convictions and your last conviction was on 06/05/02 for the offence of indecent assault. Your good behaviour for almost 10 years before you committed the offence in this case will be considered as a mitigating factor. Your counsel submitted that you are genuinely remorseful.
 
 
• Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I add 04 years to the starting point. Now your sentence is 06 years imprisonment.
 
 
• I deduct 02 years of your sentence considering the aforementioned mitigating factors.
 
 
• For committing the offence of sexual assault, I hereby sentence you for a term of 04 years imprisonment. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 03 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Act reads thus;

“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• I note that you have spent around 05 months in custody for this matter. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 05 months.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to 04 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 03 years. Considering the time spent in custody, the time remaining to be served is as follows;

Head Sentence – 03 years, and 07 months
 
Non-parole period – 02 years, and 07 months
 
  
• Having considered the facts in this case, a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order is issued against you, identifying the victim ‘IT’ as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any form of contact with the victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

_____________________________________
 
 
1.] The accused has been convicted after trial in this Court of one count of rape and one count of Attempting to Pervert the course of justice.
 
 
2.] The brief facts of the case are that on the 27th October 2012, the accused who was at the time a serving police officer, met the victim Mere (not her real name) in a Nadi nightclub in the very early hours of the morning. He persuaded her to go with him to his quarters at the Namaka Police Station, on the pretext of getting more money but when they got there he raped her in one of the single officers’’ quarters which was vacant at the time. 
 
 
3.] In the following few days he, his wife and a policeman friend persistently tried to get Mere to withdraw her complaint which she refused to do. 
 
 
4.] The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment and the tariff for rape of an adult is a term of imprisonment of between 7 and 15 years (Marawa  [2004] FJHC 338.).
 
 
5.] In mitigation, counsel tells me that he is 40 years old, married with 2 children, aged 12 and 6. He has been the sole breadwinner for his family and he supports his parents who live in the village. Ever since October 2012 his Police Force salary has been interdicted and has had to support his family on $25 per week. 
 
 
6.] The accused asked to be allowed to mitigate on his own behalf, which the Court allowed. In a passionate and pathetic submission he told the Court how much he had been suffering for the last 5 years and that the delay in bringing this trial to hearing has caused him so many difficulties. His bail restrictions have effectively kept him under house arrest with little money. 
 
 
7.] The accused has a clear record and he spent 3 months in custody before being admitted to bail. 
 
 
8.] I take a starting point for the rape of 10 years imprisonment. There are no aggravating features. 
 
 
9.] His family circumstances are of no mitigatory value. A father of two very young children at the time should not have been out drinking at 3am in the morning. In his submission, it was all about how he had suffered, but not one word of remorse as to the effect his abuse would have had on the young woman. This Court is aware however of the delay in getting this matter to trial, a delay which has caused more hardship to the accused than normally would be the case. Allowance must be made for that. 
 
 
10.] I deduct 12 months from the sentence for his clear record and time spent in custody and a further year to reflect the hardship occasioned by the long delay in bringing this matter to trial. 
 
 
11.] For the rape, he is sentenced to as term of imprisonment of 8 years and is to serve a minimum of 7 years before he is eligible for parole. 
 
 
12.] The maximum penalty for an attempt to pervert the course of justice is imprisonment for 5 years. 
 
 
13.] There is very little precedent to guide a sentencing court for this offence, but the relatively low maximum would suggest a term in the range of 12 to 36 months. Attempts to prevent a witness from giving true evidence would attract terms at the low end of that band but more sophisticated attempts to subvert the judicial process would attract sentences at the higher end of the band. 
 
 
14.] For this rather unsophisticated attempt to have a complaint withdrawn I take a starting point of 15 months imprisonment. The attempt to have the complainant’s sister influence the withdrawal is an aggravating feature and for that I add a further 3 month’s imprisonment. The clear record and time in custody have been reflected in the rape sentence. 
 
 
15.] I order that the accused serve 18 months imprisonment for the offence, a term to be served concurrently with the rape sentence. 
 
 
16.] There are no exhibits to be dealt with.
 
 
17.] Orders:
 
  
• The accused is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 7 years for the rape offence.
 
• He is to serve 18 months for the attempt to pervert the course of justice, a term to be served concurrently with the rape offence.

74605,"SENTENCE

[1] The Accused above named is charged with one count of Rape punishable under Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

[2] Originally this case was fixed for trial on several occasions and it could not be reached because of various reasons. On the last occasion when the trial was about to begin the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge in the presence of the assessors.

[3] The Accused admitted to the summary of facts submitted by the State. According to the summary of facts the Complainant was a 7 year old girl. The Accused is her uncle living in the same house. On the 21st March 2010 she was watching television and lying on the lap of the Accused. After sometimes the Accused took the child out by holding her hands. He had taken the child to the village hall which was dark there he had felt her, kissed her on her lips, removed her panties and touched her vagina. Thereafter he removed his sulu and penetrated her vagina when she cried in pain he stopped it.

After seeing both, the mother inquired from the child, then she had relayed the incident to her. Mother in turn told it to her husband (victim's father). Matter was reported to the police and the child was subjected to medical examination on the 23/5/2010. There it was found the child had injuries on her vagina and the hymen was not intact.

Law

[4] Section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree prescribes imprisonment for life as maximum sentence for the offence of Rape.

Tariff

[5] Tariff for the offence of Rape was discussed in many cases it ranges from 10 to 16 years imprisonment.

[6] In William Christopher Millbery & 2 Others vs. R (2002) EWCA Crim. 2891 (09 December 2002) the Court held:

""22. The Panel confirms the 15 years and upwards starting point for a campaign of rape. This is recommended where the offender has repeatedly raped the same victim over a course of time as well as for those involving multiple victims.""

[7] In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994 the Court of Appeal observed (at p.6):

""We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

[8] In State v Lasaro Turagabeci [1996] FJHC 173; HAC 0008.1996S (27 November 1996) Pain J. said:

""The Courts made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.""

[9] In a case with some similarities to this case Shameem J in The State v Navauniani Koroi (unreported) Cr. App. Case No. HAA0050.2002S arrived at a sentence of 12 years and explained:

""Taking the 7 years as the starting point, I increase the term by two years for the young age of the complainant, and a further three years for the fact that she is your daughter. I add a further year for the resulting pregnancy. I reduce the term by one year for the guilty plea and other mitigation ....""

[10] In The State v Peniasi Senikarawa (unreported) High Court Suva Cr. Case HAC 0017.2008S; 20 May 2003 the accused was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. Shameem J started on the tariff at 7 years. The mitigation was that the accused had a good character, was hardworking and struggling to raise his son single handed. But for being in breach of his position of trust to his 14 year old step-daughter, for the beatings he gave her, and for the fact that she had to give evidence twice, the court imposed a further 4 years.

""The Courts made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.""

[11] State v Sailosi Selebula (2010) HAC 148 of 2010 – The Court held that a single count of rape should properly reflect the complete abhorrence that members of the public feel towards adults who abuse young children in their case. The Court stated that a sentence in the region of 10 years would be appropriate. The accused was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment reduced to 14 years for good character. A non-parole period of 11 years was imposed.

[12] In R v M [1988] VSCA 68 (7 October 1998) the Supreme Court of Victoria – Court of Appeal held for the count of oral rape that the accused be sentenced to 6 years. We wish to draw attention to the fact here that the complainant was an adult and also the accused had been charged for other offences in this case. But the seriousness of the count of oral rape still reflects the sentence given and in the case before the Court this involves a child.

[13] Further the Court observed in Millbery v R (supra):

""60 .... we note that the Court's prior to the guideline were regarding relationship rape as serious and deserving heavy sentence.""

[14] In the case of State v Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216; HAC 027.2011 (18 April 2011) the Court in this case stated that:

""Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to ber very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect societies abhorrence for such crimes. Our nations children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""

[15] Considering the above factors I commence your sentence at 14 years imprisonment.

[16] Aggravating factors

	a.	Victim is your niece and you betrayed the trust between uncle and niece;
	b.	You really ruined the life of a 7 year old girl;
	i.	You took advantage of the vulnerability of this small child.

Considering all I increase your sentence by 3 years now your sentence is 17 years imprisonment.

[17] Mitigating circumstances

	a.	You have pleaded guilty (not at first occasion after about 3 years);
	b.	You claim that you are remorseful;
	i.	Family depending on you

Considering all I reduce 6 years from your sentence now your sentence is 11 years imprisonment.

[18] Since you have 2 previous convictions within operational period I am unable to give you any further concessions.

[19] Considering Section 18(1) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree I impose 9 years as non parole period.

[20] You are sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 9 years imprisonment.

[21] 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

256798,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused has been convicted of two counts of rape of his 10 year old niece in the year 2014 in Savusavu.
 
 
[2] The facts were that the accused had a house in the village in which he lived alone. 
 
 
[3] On the first occasion he called Mere (not her real name) into the house. The two of them were inside alone. He placed her against a wall, removed her trousers and invaded her with a finger.
 
 
[4] On the second occasion when he called her in he was lying on the bed. He gave her some money and then told her to lie down on the floor. He removed her clothes and his clothes, lay on top of her and started moving up and down. Mere said it was causing pain in her vagina because he was “putting it in”. 
 
 
[5] She said that there were several occasions that he did this and on each occasion he would give her money to buy sweets and gum. 
 
 
[6] The incidents came to light when an Aunt noticed that she had unexplained sums of money and observations and persistent enquiry of Mere revealed the relationship. 
 
 
Mitigation
 
 
[7] In written submissions in mitigation, Counsel pleads for mercy. The accused is 49 years old and separatedfrom his wife for 17 years.He has one son who lives in Suva. At the relevant time he was a farmer within the village 
 
 
[8] He is a first offender and is said to be very remorseful. The Court has noticed that remorse throughout his trial. 
 
 
[9] He has spent 17 months on remand whilst awaiting trial. The maximumpenaltyfor rape is life imprisonment and the Supreme Court has said that sentences for rape of minors should be a term of imprisonment of between 10 and 16 years. (AnandAbhayRajCAV003/2014).
 
 
[10] In following that case I take a starting point of 10 years.
 
 
Aggravation
 
 
[11] The abuse of a niece by her uncle is a serious breach of trust and the 37 years age difference makes it very much worse.
 
 
[12] The victim wasa very shy and impressionable 10 year old at the time and these assaults would almost certainly scar her own development to sexual maturity. As this Court said in Mario Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216:
 
 
 “Our nation’s children must be protected and they must be allowed
 
to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound”.
 
 
[13] A further aggravating feature in this case is that the accused enticed the girl with small gifts of money and sweets.
 
 
[14] For these aggravating features I add six years to the starting point bringing the sentence up to a term of 16 years. 
 
 
[15] For his clear recordandobvious remorse I deduct two years bringing the sentence down to 14 years.
 
 
[16] I deduct the 17 months he has spent in remand awaiting trial and the final sentence that this Court imposes for rape is twelve years and five months.
 
 
[17] That is the sentence to be imposed for each of the two counts of rape. These terms will be served concurrently and he will serve a minimum term of 9 years and 6 months before being eligible for parole.

[1] In a judgment delivered on 31 May, 2017, this court found the accused guilty and convicted him for two counts of rape as per the following information: 
 
FIRST COUNT
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (c) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ILIESA RAGIGIA on the 1st day of July, 2013, at NADI in the WESTERN DIVISION, used his penis to penetrate the mouth of TEMALESI BULIVOU, without her consent.
 
 
SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ILIESA RAGIGIA, on the 1st day of July, 2013 at NADI in the WESTERN DIVISION, used his penis to penetrate the vagina of TEMALESI BULIVOU, without her consent. 
 
 
[2] The brief facts were as follows:
 
The complainant was a tenant of the accused living next door to the house of the accused. The complainant was asked by the wife of the accused to look after her children in her absence. The complainant felt sorry for the children and was helping them.
 
 
[3] On 1st July, 2013 at about 1pm after hanging the accused children’s clothes to dry the complainant saw the accused standing near his bathroom wearing a blue and white stripe towel without a t-shirt. 
 
 
[4] The accused pulled the complainant into the bathroom, she begged the accused by saying in the Itaukei language “tau kerekere” meaning for the accused to stop what he was doing. 
 
 
[5] In the bathroom the accused opened his towel and forced his penis into the complainant’s mouth for 10 minutes. At this time the complainant was struggling with the accused, crying and the accused was pushing her hands away.
 
 
[6] The complainant did not shout because she was frightened and afraid that the accused would do something to her. Again the complainant begged the accused to stop after which the accused opened the bathroom door.
 
 
[7] The accused after putting on his towel dragged the complainant to his bedroom by holding her hand tightly. There was no one around the complainant was crying and afraid but she did not shout since she was feeling weak.
 
 
[8] In the bedroom the accused locked the door and told the complainant not to shout, the accused pulled the complainant towards him and then pushed her to the floor. The accused was trying to take out her top, the complainant was struggling to push the accused away but he kept on pulling her hand. The accused managed to pull her top up the complainant kept on crying begging him to stop. To cover her body the complainant sat on the floor with her legs crossed. The accused was able to remove the complainant’s long pants and top. 
 
 
[9] The accused then forced himself on her when she struggled to push him away he held her tightly. The accused then forced his penis into the complainant’s vagina for 30 minutes.
 
 
[10] The complainant did not consent to what the accused had done to her. After this the accused stood up put on his towel and went away. The complainant ran outside the house crying, at her house she informed her cousin brother Pajilai Bale and thereafter the matter was reported to Police.
 
 
[11] Both counsel have filed written submissions for which the court is grateful. 
 
 
[12] Counsel for the accused presented the following personal details and mitigation on behalf of the accused:
 
 
 (a) The accused is a first offender;
 (b) He is self-employed and 54 years of age;

(c) His level of education is up to Form 6;
 
(d) He is married with six children the youngest one is 3 years of age and the eldest 18.
 
 
 Counsel for the accused also submits that the accused has helped in the formation of two major community projects in Nadi namely:
 
 
 
(a) The Standard Cement Korovuto Project; and
 
 (b) Maqalevu Project owned by the Beijing Restaurant. 
 
 
 
 In 2016 the accused donated 10 acres of his land to the Fiji Mission Seventh Day Adventist Church to build their church in Korovuto. Counsel further submits that the accused is the sole breadwinner of the family who provides for the needs of his wife and children. The children are very much attached to their father and a long custodial sentence will be detrimental to the family. The Counsel also relies on the five character references given on behalf of the accused. All the references provided speak highly of the accused as a hardworking, dedicated, honest and a person of good character.
 
 
[13] I accept in accordance with the Supreme Court decision in Anand Abhay Raj vs the State, CAV 0003 of 2014 that the personal circumstances and family background of an accused person has little mitigatory value in cases of sexual nature.
 
 
 The aggravating features are:
 
 
 (a) Breach of Trust

The victim was a tenant on the accused property who trusted and respected him like her father and the victim was assisting his children by attending to household chores in the absence of his wife. The accused by his actions has committed a serious breach of trust.
 
 
[14] The maximum penalty for the offence of rape is life imprisonment which means this offence falls under the most serious category of offences.
 
 
[15] In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal had stated:
 
 
“We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than the starting point.”
[16] Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act states:
 
 
“If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.”
 
 
[17] I am satisfied that the two offences for which the accused stands convicted are offences founded on the same facts and are of similar character. Therefore taking into account section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act I prefer to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the two offences.
 
 
[18] It is the duty of the court to protect women from sexual violations of any kind that is the reason why the law makers have imposed life imprisonment for the offence of rape as the maximum penalty.
 
 
[19] Bearing in mind the seriousness of the offences committed I take 9 years imprisonment as the starting point of your aggregate sentence. I add 2 years for the aggravating factor, bringing an interim total of 11 years imprisonment. Although the personal circumstances and family background of the accused has little mitigatory value, however, I find your good character has substantive mitigating value. I therefore reduce the sentence by 2 years.
 
 
[20] I note the accused has been in remand for about 1 month and 18 days. I exercise my discretion to further reduce the sentence for the remand period by 2 months in accordance with section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act as a period of imprisonment already served. 
 
 
[21] Under the aggregate sentencing regime of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act the final sentence of imprisonment for the two offences of rape is 8 years and 10 months imprisonment.
 
 
[22] Having considered section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act and the serious nature of the offences committed on the victim compels me to state that the purpose of this sentence is to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances of the case and to deter offenders and other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature. 
 
 
[23] Under section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I impose 7 years as a non-parole period to be served before the accused is eligible for parole. I consider this non-parole period to be appropriate in the rehabilitation of the accused which is just in the circumstances of this case.
 
 
[24] Mr. Ragigia you have committed an abhorrent crime against a victim who trusted you. In this case the victim was doing a good deed to your family in particular to your children by attending to household chores in the absence of your wife. I am sure it will be difficult for the complainant to forget what you had done to her. Your actions towards the victim were deplorable and selfish. This court will be failing in its duty if a deterrent custodial sentence was not imposed.
 
 
[25] I am satisfied that the term of 8 years and 10 months imprisonment does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each offence. 
 
 
[26] In summary I pass an aggregate sentence of 8 years and 10 months imprisonment for the two offences of rape that the accused have been convicted of with a non-parole period of 7 years to be served before the accused is eligible for parole.
 
 
[27] 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

• Eroni Vakalevulevu, you were charged for the following offences by the Director of Public Prosecutions;
 

FIRST COUNT
Statement of offence
 
ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT RAPE: Contrary to Section 209 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, assaulted NASI VAKACEGU by punching her on the back with intent to commit rape.
 
 
SECOND COUNT
Statement of offence
 
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted NASI VAKACEGU by rubbing his penis on the body of the said NASI VAKACEGU.
 
 
THIRD COUNT
Statement of offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (c) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of NASI VAKACEGU, with his penis without her consent.
 
  
• You pleaded guilty for all the above charges on 02nd December 2015 and you were convicted accordingly.
 
 
• According to the summary of facts;
  
• You are the stepfather of the victim who is 14 years old. On the 16th October 2015, while your wife and two children were attending a funeral in Naivicula village, you asked the victim who was staying at a Pastor's house at that time to come home with you. You then called her to the bedroom, you caressed her breasts and you forcefully undressed her. You told her to bend down to the floor and you rubbed your penis against her body.
 
 
• You then punched her back, strangled her neck, grabbed her hair and told her to suck your penis.
 
 
• You then held her neck to force her mouth to open and inserted your penis into her mouth.
 
 
• You stopped when you saw the victim crying.
 

 
• Section 209 of the Crimes Decree 2009, provides that the maximum sentence for the offence of Assault with intent to commit Rape is 10 years. In the case of Jone Tabaka v State [2013] FJHC 667, this court had endorsed an imprisonment of 1 to 4 years as the tariff for this offence.
 
 
• The offence of Sexual Assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJSC 1414, this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for Sexual Assault.
 
 
• The maximum sentence for the offence of Rape is imprisonment for life and the sentencing tariff for rape of a child is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, reads thus;
 

""If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.""
 
  
• The three offences you are convicted of are based on the same facts. Therefore, in view of the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I opt to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the three offences.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors;
  
• You are victim's stepfather. There is a breach of trust
 
 
• You are 20 years older than the victim
 
 
• There was planning involved and you used your authority to compel the victim to be alone with you during the time of offence
 
 
• You used violence on her
 

 
• I consider the following as your mitigating factors;
  
• You pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity
 
 
• Your counsel says you are remorseful
 
 
• You are 34 years old and married with 2 children
 

 
• In 2008, you have been convicted of the offence of attempted Rape. Therefore, I cannot consider you as a person of previous good character.
 
 
• I consider 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence. Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I add 7 years. Now your sentence is 17 years imprisonment.
 
 
• You pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Thereby, you saved Court's time and also prevented the victim from having to relive her ordeal by giving evidence in this Court. Therefore, you deserve a one third reduction of your sentence. I deduct 5 years and 8 months of your sentence for your early guilty plea and arrive at 11 years and 4 months. For the other mitigating factors, I deduct a further 1 year.
 
 
• I hereby sentence you for an imprisonment term of 10 years and 4 months. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 9 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.
 
 
• The offence of Rape attracts the highest term of imprisonment considering the other two offences you are convicted of and the above sentence is within the tariff of the offence of Rape when it comes to a child victim. Hence, I am satisfied that the above aggregate sentence of imprisonment does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment had this court imposed separate terms of imprisonment for the three charges.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree reads thus;
 

""If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.""
 
  
• I note that you were first produced before the Magistrate Court on 19th October 2015. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you pertaining to the sentence imposed on you in this case. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 2 months.
 
 
• Accordingly, the time remaining to be served is as follows;
 

Head Sentence – 10 years and 2 months
 
Non-parole period – 8 years and 10 months
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

[1] Eliki Butadroka, on 15 March 2018, you freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and two counts of digital rape. The charges arose in July 2016 at Navukebuli Village. The victim was sexually abused when she came to your village with her parents to attend her grandfather’s funeral. At the time, she was 12 years old. You were 19 years old. There is no relationship between you and the victim but it appears that you developed a friendship with her when she was in your village. You lured her into the bushes and removed her skirt and underwear. You kissed the victim on the lips (count 1). You penetrated her vagina with your tongue (count 2). You penetrated her mouth with your penis (alternative count to the third count). You admitted to these sexual acts. Since the victim was under the age of 13 years, she was incapable of giving a valid consent. You are represented by counsel. Your guilty pleas are competent and informed. You are convicted as charged. I now pronounce your sentence.
 
[2] In assessing the seriousness of the offences, I have borne in mind the maximum punishment prescribed by law for each offence. The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 10 years imprisonment. The tariff is 2 to 8 years’ imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the actual act committed by the accused (State v Baravilala [2016] FJHC 679; HAC49.2016 (27 July 2016)). The act of kissing is on the lower end of the seriousness and is tantamount to an indecent assault. 
 
 
[3] The maximum penalty prescribed for rape is life imprisonment. The tariff for rape of a child or a juvenile girl is 10 to 16 years’ imprisonment (Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2014). In Ram v State [2015] FJSC 26; CAV12.2015 (23 October 2015), the Supreme Court said at [21]:
 
The casting of the offence of rape in the Crimes Decree is such that no distinctions are drawn as to gravity of offending dependent on the object used to penetrate or of the orifice of the victim penetrated. No separate penalties are prescribed. Sufficient no doubt is the unwanted invasion, the violation of the person, the forcible intrusion into the privacy and body of another. (per Gates CJ)
 
[4] In State v Vatu [2015] FJHC 263; HAC231.2011 (23 April 2015), an 18-year old accused was convicted of two counts of lingual rape of a 4-year old girl after early guilty pleas. Madigan J sentenced the accused to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years for the following reasons at [7]:
 
It appears to be extremely important in this case that a balance be struck between expectations of the community that such activity be punished and retribution be afforded the victim with the need to recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood. Whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him (her) when faced with a serious crime or crimes, a Court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to follow the same course of action.
 
[5] In State v Tokatokavanua [2015] FJHC 656; HAC66.2015 (8 September 2015), an 18-year old offender pleaded guilty to anal rape of a 9-year old boy. Aluthge J sentenced the offender to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
 
[6] In assessing the seriousness of your actual acts, I take into account that you did not use any form of force or physical violence on the victim. You are now 21 years old and earn a living as a fisherman. You have previous good character, which is a mitigating factor. The most compelling mitigating factor is your guilty plea. You pleaded guilty to the charges before the case was listed for trial. You have relieved the victim, who is a child from the further trauma of giving evidence in court. You have also saved court time and resources. Your expression of remorse is genuine. You have spent time in custody while on remand for twelve days. I give significant weight to your early guilty pleas, expression of remorse, previous good character and young age.
 
[7] The aggravating factors are that the victim was a child and that she trusted you to accompany her around the village when she was attending her grandfather’s funeral. You exploited her vulnerability and trust by sexually violating her. The courts have a duty to protect young girls from any form of sexual abuse by denouncing such conduct. The purposes of your sentence are to denounce your conduct and deter others from sexually abusing juvenile girls. 
 
 
[8] Taking all these factors into account, I sentence you to 6 months’ imprisonment for sexual assault and 8 years’ imprisonment for each count of rape, to be served concurrently. I decline to fix a non-parole period. I now give reasons why I have sentenced you below the normal range of 10-16 years’ imprisonment and without a non-parole period. You were relatively young, 19 years old, when you committed the offence. You are a first time offender. The offence you committed did not involve use of threats or physical violence. You have taken responsibility for your conduct and are genuinely remorseful. In these special circumstances, it is justified to accord you with an opportunity to rehabilitate while serving your imprisonment sentence. I refer you for counselling by Empower Pacific, Labasa. The Office of the Legal Aid Commission is to assist Empower Pacific in the facilitation of counselling of the offender. 
 
[9] I refer the victim for counselling by Medical Services Pacific, Labasa. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is to assist Medical Services Pacific in the facilitation of counselling of the victim.

244624,"SENTENCE
 
  
• On 1 August 2016, the court delivered a judgment, on the following counts, in the following information:

Count 1
 
Statement of Offence
 
MURDER: Contrary to section 237 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
SITIVENI QIO VASUTURAGA on the 10th of August, 2014 at Kadavu in the Southern Division, murdered ELENOA WAQAICECE.
 
 
Count 2
 
Statement of Offence
 
MURDER: Contrary to section 237 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
SITIVENI QIO VASUTURAGA on the 10th of August, 2014 at Kadavu in the Southern Division, murdered SALASEINI KUNAYASI.
 
 
Count 3
 
Statement of Offence
 
ATTEMPTED MURDER: Contrary to section 44(1) and section 237 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
SITIVENI QIO VASUTURAGA on the 10th of August, 2014 at Kadavu in the Southern Division, attempted to murder JIMMY VICTOR MORRELL.
 
  
• On count no. 1, the court found you guilty of murdering your wife, Ms. Elenoa Waqaicece, on 10 August 2014, at Kadavu in the Southern Division. The court then convicted you accordingly. On count no. 2, the court found you not guilty of murdering your mother-in-law, Ms. Salaseini Kunayasi, on 10 August 2014, at Kadavu in the Southern Division, but guilty of her manslaughter, at the time. The court then acquitted you of the murder charge, but convicted you on the lesser offence of manslaughter. On count no. 3, the court found you not guilty, and acquitted you accordingly.
 
 
• The brief facts were as follows. On 10 August 2014, you lived with your wife in a rented two bedroom house at Namuana Village, Kadavu. You were 41 years old, while your wife was 38 years old. Your wife worked at Vunisea Hospital as a cook, while you stayed at home doing domestic chores, cook, farmed and dived for fish for the family. You had been married for 16 years. Your mother-in-law moved in with the two of you when you two went to Kadavu. She was 51 years old. Also, residing with you were your nephews Jimmy Morrell and Steven Morrell, including you two’s adopted daughter, your wife’s namesake.
 
 
• You and your mother-in-law do not get on well. She saw you as “a good for nothing lay about”. At times, she felt you don’t deserve her daughter, and she often asked her to leave you for good. On 10 August 2014, an argument started between the two of you. She started calling you names and repeatedly swore at you. Your wife joined in the argument siding with her mother. Your wife, mother-in-law and your nephews Jimmy and Steven decided to leave the house. You stopped your wife. You two argued in the kitchen. Your wife threatened you with a kitchen knife. You grabbed the same and stabbed her to death. You later went into the sitting room, and later to the porch, where you repeatedly stabbed your mother-in-law to death.
 
 
• There is only one sentence for murder and that is a mandatory life imprisonment (section 237 of the Crimes Decree 2009). For the murder of your wife, I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment (count no. 1). The law gives the court power to fix a minimum term to be served before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji (section 119 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji).
 
 
• Life is precious in this world. You have unnecessarily taken away the life of your wife. This woman had choosen to share her life with you by marrying you. You had been married for 16 years. The problem that arose on 10 August 2014 between you and your wife could have been resolved in a more peaceful way. But you choose to end her life on that day by stabbing her to death. By doing so, you had shown no regard whatsoever to her right to life. You had shown no regard whatsoever to her personal safety. You had shown no love to the woman who had choosen to share her life with you for the last 16 years. You have to accept that you will have to pay for your crime with the loss of your liberty. At least, you are still breathing, while your wife stopped breathing on 10 August 2014 at about 5.05 pm. I note that you had been remanded in custody since 21 August 2014, that is, approximately 2 years ago. I also note that you are a first offender at the age of 43 years, and co-operated with the police during the investigation. Taking the above into account, I fix the minimum term to be served before pardon may be considered as 21 years imprisonment.
 
 
• For the manslaughter conviction in count no. 2, the maximum sentence is 25 years imprisonment (section 239 of the Crimes Decree 2009). In State v Arthur James Kamoe Moore, Criminal Case No. HAC 114 of 2010S, High Court, Suva, I said the following, “... “Manslaughter” is a serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. However, case laws in Fiji seemed to show that penalties for manslaughter range from a suspended prison sentence to 12 years imprisonment. Sentences in the upper range were reserved for cases where the degree of violence was high and the provocation given was minimal. Sentences at the lower end of the scale were reserved for case where the violence used was minimal and the provocation given was in the extreme; see Kim Nam Bae v The State, Fiji Court of Appeal, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0015 of 1998S; The State v Frances Bulewa Kean, Criminal Case No. HAC 037 of 2007S, High Court, Suva; State v Amali Rasalusalu, Criminal Case No. HAC 003 of 2003, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence passed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors...”
 
• The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows: 
• (i) The use of extreme violence to resolve a problem. This incident arose as a result of your inability to resolve this domestic problem in a peaceful way. Although your mother-in-law was somewhat harsh on you, that does not mean that her life had to be taken away to resolve the problem. You had no right to take away a person’s life, no matter what the provocation was. You can only take away a person’s life on the grounds of self-defence, if it was necessary to preserve you or others’ life. That was not the case here. Your 51 year old mother-in-law is dead, while you, 43 years old, is still alive. You showed no regard whatsoever to the victim’s right to life. For your offending, you must not complain when your liberty is taken away to pay for your crime;
 
 
• (ii) As a result of your offending, Ms. Salaseini Kunayasi had lost her life, and this obviously will cause heart-ache and sadness to her family.
 

 
• The mitigating factors were as follows: 
• (i) At the age of 43 years, this is your first offence;
 
• (ii) You had been remanded in custody for approximately 2 years
 

 
• I start with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 10 years imprisonment. I deduct 1 year for the accused being a first offender, leaving a balance of 9 years. I deduct another 2 years, for time spent in remand, while awaiting trial. The balance is 7 years imprisonment. On count no. 2, I sentence you to 7 years imprisonment.
 
 
• In summary, your sentences are as follows: 
• (i) Count no. 1 : Murder : Mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum 


term of 21 years to be served, before pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
 
 (ii) Count no. 2 : Manslaughter : 7 years imprisonment
 
 
• Because of the principle of the totality of sentence, I direct that the above sentences be made concurrent to each other, that is, a final sentence of mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 21 years to be served before a pardon may be considered.
 
• Mr. Sitiveni Qio Vasuturaga, for the murder of your wife Elenoa Waqaicece (count no. 1) and the manslaughter of your mother-in-law Salaseini Kunayasi (count no. 2), on 10 August 2014, at Kadavu in the Southern Division, I sentence you to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 21 years to be served in prison, before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, to be effective forthwith.
 
 
• You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

242935,"SENTENCE
 
 
[Name of the victim is suppressed. The victim will be referred to as [M.V.]
 
  
• Senijieli Waqanituva, you stand convicted for one count of Rape contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.
 
 
• The brief facts of the case were that you went to the victim's home in the night when her parents were away and you called her to the room. Her grandmother and her sisters had been sleeping in the sitting room. When the victim refused to come, you repeatedly called her. Then, when she came to the room you pestered her to remove her clothes and inserted your finger into her vagina. The victim 'M.V.' was 11 years old at the time you raped her.
 
• Rape of small children has become frequent in Fiji and I find that the punishment imposed should be adequate and also should deter offenders. 
 
 
• In State v. Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216; HAC 027.2011 (18 April 2011) 18 April 2011) Hon. Justice Madigan observed:
 

""Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""
 
 
In that case the child was 14 years old and the accused was sentenced to 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
 
  
• The maximum penalty for Rape under the Crimes Decree44 of 2009 is imprisonment for life. Tariff for the offence of Rape of children is 10 – 16 years imprisonment. (Anand Abhay Raj v. State[2014] FJHC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2012).
 
 
• In the instant case, the aggravating factors are, you breached the trust as you are a cousin of the victim, and it is a domestic violence. The victim was 11 years old when you raped her.
 
 
• The mitigating factors are that you are a young offender who was 20 years old at the time of the offence and also was a first offender. Your personal background that was submitted on your behalf that your parents were separated since your childhood and that you were living with the grandparents is also considered.
 
 
• I take 12 years as my starting point and add 3 years for the aggravating factors. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors and now your sentence is 12 years imprisonment. I further deduct another 15 months for your period in remand.
 
 
• Now your final sentence is 10 years and 9 months. You will serve 9 years before being eligible for parole.
 
 
• Having considered the domestic relationship between you and the victim 'M.V.', I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order in place identifying the victim 'M.V.' as the protected person.

73541,"JUDGMENT

	1.	The appellant was charged before the Sigatoka Magistrate under following counts:

First Count
Statement of Offence

ABDUCTION WITH INTENT TO CONFINE PERSON:- Contrary to Section 281 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

Particulars of the Offence

POASA MANAKIWAI on the 30th day of July to 2nd day of August, 2013 at Naidovi, Sigatoka in the Western Division, abducted LEILANI AGNUS with intent to cause that person to be secretly and wrongfully confined. 

Second Count
Statement of Offence

DISOBEDIENCE OF LAWFUL ORDER: - Contrary to Section 202 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

Particulars of the offence

POASA MANAKIWAI on the 30th day of July, 2013 at Naidovi, Sigatoka in the Western Division disobeyed the order of the Interim Domestic Violence Restraining Order Application No. 48/13 with effective from 25th July, 2013 issued by the Sigatoka Magistrates Court.

	1.	The appellant pleaded guilty and after waiving his right to counsel on 05th August, 2013 and admitted the summary of facts the same day. He was sentenced for 2 years imprisonment for the first count and 12 months imprisonment for the 2nd count to run concurrently on 07th August, 2013.

	2.	The facts of the case are the appellant on the 30th day of July 2013 at about 1600 hours at Naidovi, Sigatoka abduct the victim with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine her and in disobedience of lawful order of the domestic violence restraining order in effect from 25th July, 2013.

Both parties are known to each other since 2010 as boyfriend and girlfriend. However, they had on and off relationship. Appellant was explained the domestic violence restraining order on 25th July, 2013. On 30th July, 2013 when the complainant was on her way to shop with her cousin, appellant who came in a carrier, grabbed the complainant into that vehicle and abducted her to a friend's house. 

They had spent two nights and complainant was threatened not to contact with anyone about their whereabouts.

After matter was reported, appellant was arrested and he admitted the offence in caution interview statement.

	1.	This appeal against the sentence was filed on 15 August, 2013 within time.

	2.	The grounds of appeal are:
		(i) That the sentence imposed by the sentencing Magistrate is harsh and excessive. 

		(ii) That the learned Magistrate failed to consider the prompt early guilty plea on the very first instance in saving the courts time and resources in a defended trial.

		(iii) That the learned Magistrate failed to consider FOUR CLASSICAL PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING.

		(iv) That no regard was given to the Section 4 (1) (d) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, as to the rehabilitation of the appellant and the sentence should have been suspended.

		(v) That the learned Magistrate failed to consider Section 4 (2) (c) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree in regards to the nature and gravity of this particular offence.

		(vi) That the learned Magistrate erred in law and fact, in taking irrelevant matters into consideration.

		(vii) That the sentence is neither wrong in principle nor excessive in length but because of the impact of the sentence on the appellant.

	3.	On 31st October, 2013 appellant requested to amend the grounds of appeal.

	4.	Accordingly he wants to maintain only one ground that is:

That the learned Magistrate erred when his lordship took into account as an aggravating factor the fact ""that you have breached the DVRO"" and by doing so resulted in the three years enhance of sentence being harsh and excessive.

	1.	However, in the written submissions filed by the appellant on 21st January, 2013 he had stated that he maintains the following grounds of appeal:
		(i) That the sentence is harsh and excessive in exceeding the starting point tariff of 12 months.

		(ii) Failure to give proper credit of a reduction a third of the sentence to reflect the early guilty plea.

		(iii) Breach of DVRO as an aggravating factor was wrongly considered and taken into account. 

Grounds (i) - Sentence harsh and excessive and exceeding the starting point tariff

	1.	The learned Magistrate had selected a starting point of three years. He had not mentioned any guideline judgment he had followed. 

	2.	In Sasau v State [2012] FJHC 1301; HAC 111.2009 Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan had held:

""The maximum penalty for abduction is seven years imprisonment. There has been no tariff set in this jurisdiction for the offence. Thurairaja J purported to set the tariff at six months to 18 months in the case of Sadrugu HAC 116 of 2011, where the learned Judge said that tariff has been set in Sanoka [2009] FJHC 91. This is incorrect. Sanoka did not set such a tariff.""

Sentencing for abduction has been discussed by the English Court of Appeal in Spence and Thomas 5 Cr. App. R (S) 413 where the Court said that a top end of sentencing range should be reserved for cases where the victim is taken hostage or a ransom has been demanded, and at the maximum if undue violence or firearms are used. The bottom end of the tariff can be appropriate in cases of family disputes or lovers' tiffs.

As the maximum penalty for this offence is seven years both under the Penal Code and the Crimes Decree 2009, an appropriate tariff for the offence would be between 18 months and four years, depending on the violence, length of detention, use of weapons, etc.""

	1.	Although the learned Magistrate had not mentioned about this judgment, the starting point taken by the Magistrate is 3 years, which is within the tariff. However, considering the facts and circumstances of this case, it falls in the midline of the tariff and correct starting point should have been 2 years. This ground has to be considered with the other grounds.

Ground (ii) - Failure to give proper credit of a reduction a third of the sentence to reflect the early Guilty plea

	1.	The learned Magistrate had reached an interim sentence of 6 years after adding 3 years for aggravating factors. Then he had stated ""Considering your compelling mitigation, I deduct 1/3 of the interim sentence of 6 years."" Then he had stated that ""Final sentence is 2 years imprisonment."" It is not clear as how he arrived at this final figure as he had only deducted 2 years for mitigation. To arrive at a final sentence of 2 years another 2 years has to be deducted. However, it is not recorded as to why this 2 years period is deducted. 

	2.	In Basa v State [2006] FJCA 23; AAU 0024.2005 (24 March 2006) the Court of Appeal held that:

""The appellant suggests that the reference to the fact the plea of guilty was entered late means he was not given full credit for it. Whenever an accused person admits his guilt by pleading guilty, the court will give some credit for that as a clear demonstration of remorse. However, the amount that will be given is not fixed and will depend on the offence charged and the circumstances of each case. The maximum credit is likely to be given for offences such as rape and personal violence because it saves the victim having to relive the trauma in the witness box. At the other end of the scale, little or no credit may be given if the evidence is so overwhelming that the accused has no real option but to admit it. Where, as here, the accused has admitted the offence and the receipt of his share of the money, the delay in pleading guilty must reduce the value of the plea considerably.'""

	1.	At was held in Naikelekelevesi v State [2008] FJCA 11; AAU 0061.2007 (27 June 2008) that ""Where there is a guilty plea, this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factor in a case.""

	2.	The learned Magistrate had erred by not awarding the appellant separate deduction for his guilty plea. There is merit in this ground and it succeeds.

Ground (iii) - Breach of DVRO as an aggravating factor was wrongly considered and taken into account

	1.	The learned Magistrate had added 3 years for the aggravating factors. He had stated that;

""The aggravating factor is your full knowledge that you have breached the DVRO, which you had consented to and that two nights you had kept the victim against her will. I add 3 years.""

	1.	When the appellant is also charged for disobedience of DVRO, it is an error to consider the same as aggravating factor for the other charge. The state in their submission had conceded this position. Therefore there is merit in this ground and it succeeds.

Conclusion

	1.	This background warrants this Court to exercise its powers in terms of Section 256 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree to quash the sentence passed by the Magistrate and pass other sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence within the acceptable range of tariff.

	2.	Accordingly, I take a starting point of 2 years and add 1 year for the aggravating factor that the victim was kept away for two nights. I deduct 6 months for the mitigating factors and another 1 year for the guilty plea. The final sentence for the 1st charge is 1 year and 6 months.

	3.	The sentence for the 2nd charge to stand at 12 months as the appellant had seriously violated the DVRO within short period of time.

	4.	Considering totality principle, I order both sentences to run concurrently. 

	5.	Appellant was in remand since 05th August, 2013 for a period of 5 months and 23 days. That period to be deducted from the final sentence.

	6.	I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order in place, identifying Leilani Agnus as the protected person. The appellant is hereby ordered not to have any sort of contact with the said victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.

	7.	Therefore appellant to serve 1 year and 7 days from today. Suspension of your sentence is not appropriate as you have nine previous convictions.

	8.	Appeal is allowed. Sentence is varied.

267324,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. Yesterday, in the presence of your counsels, you pleaded guilty to the following counts in the following information:
 
 
FIRST COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA, on 01 November 2017, at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted A.B. by licking her vagina.
 
 
 SECOND COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA , on 01 November 2017, at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, with his finger, penetrated the vagina of A.B., a child under the age of 13 years.
 
 
2. In fact, your guilty plea came just before the trial was to start. Your trial had been set from 20 to 23 November 2018. The information was read and explained to you in the “i-taukei” and English languages. You said you understood the same. You then pleaded guilty to both counts. Your counsels were present. You told the court that no-one forced or pressured you to plead guilty. You said you pleaded guilty to the counts voluntarily and out of your own free will.
 
 
3. The prosecution presented their summary of facts in court. The same were as follows:
 A. The Accused in this matter, MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA. He is charged with two counts – Sexual Assault and digital rape. The victim is A.B., hereinafter referred to as “the child”. The child was born on the 24th of September 2011 and therefore under the age of 13 years.
 B. The Accused is the brother of the child’s mother’s father and therefore a constant visitor to child’s home as they were very closely related.
 C. The Accused lived in the same village as the child.
 D. On the 1st day of November 2017, the child, A.B., who was 6 years old at that time, returned home from Kindergarten school. On that same day, when the child reached her home in Yacata, the Accused also arrived at her home. No one except the child was at home when the Accused went to the child’s home that afternoon – 1st November 2017.
 E. The Accused then told the child to remove her pants and her undergarments. The child followed what the Accused told her and removed her pants and her undergarments.
 F. After the child removed her pants and her undergarments, the Accused proceeded to do the following to her:
 G. SEXUAL ASSAULT
 The Accused, Mataitoga Rogoivosa, then used his tongue to lick the vagina of the child, A.B., who was at that time, under the age of 13 years.
 RAPE
 Thereafter, the Accused, Mataitoga Rogoivosa, penetrated his finger into the vagina of the child, A.B., who was at that time a child under the age of 13 years.
 H. The Accused had done the above to child in her home when the rest of her family members were not around.
 I. The Accused made admissions in his caution interview as per attached [not provided].
 
 
4. The court then checked with your counsel, on your behalf, on whether or not you admitted the above summary of facts. Your counsel told the court that you admitted the prosecution’s summary of facts. Your counsel also said that you admitted the particulars of the offences in count 1 and 2 in the information. As a result of the above, the court found you guilty as charged on both counts in the information, and convicted you accordingly on those counts.
 
 
5. The prosecution said, you were a first offender at the age of 54 years old. Your antecedent report was considered. You were married with four children, aged between 40 and 23 years old. You resided at Yacata Village and was a subsistence farmer. The victim’s impact report was considered. You did not challenge the above reports. Your counsel then submitted a well prepared written plea in mitigation. The same also contained your sentence submission. The prosecution also submitted their written sentence submission. I have carefully considered the papers submitted by you and the prosecution, and I have listened very carefully to you two’s verbal submissions.
 
 
6. We will discuss the “rape” offence (count no. 2) first, as it is the more serious of the two offences. Of the sexual offences, “rape” is at the top of the criminal calendar. It is the unwarranted invasion of person’s body and dignity. It is the worst form of sexual assault. It invades the privacy of a person and unwanted intrusion into a person’s dignity. Society views it seriously, and through their representative in Parliament, had prescribed the maximum penalty of life imprisonment (section 207 (1) of the Crimes Act 2009). This crime, in the past, had only been prevalent amongst adults, that is, those over 18 years old. However, a disturbing trend had been witnessed in the courts. More and more, we have seen that the victims of this crime are increasingly the children of this country.
 
 
7. So much so that in Gordon Aitcheson v The State, Criminal Petition CAV 012 of 2018, the Supreme Court of Fiji, on 2 November 2018, the President of the Supreme Court of Fiji, His Lordship the Hon Chief Justice Mr. Anthony Gates, said as follows:
 
 
 
 “[23] The increases are obvious. Even this court now has many more of such cases coming before it. This sittings is also remarkable for the number of such cases listed for consideration.
 
 
 
 [24] The increasing prevalence of these crimes, crimes characterised by disturbing aggravating circumstances, means the court must consider widening the tariff for rape against children. It will be for judges to exercise their discretion taking into account the age group of these child victims. I do not for myself believe that that judicial discretion should be shackled. But it is obvious to state that crimes like these on the youngest children are the most abhorrent.
 
 
 
 [25] The tariff previously set in Raj v The State [2014] FJSC12 CAV0003.2014 (20th August 2014) should now be between 11-20 years imprisonment. Much will depend upon the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, considerations of remorse, early pleas, and finally time spent on remand awaiting trial for the final sentence outcome. The increased tariff represents the denunciation of the courts in the strongest terms.
 
 
 [26] It is entirely possible that the sentencing judge when confronted with a particularly heinous rape as in State v Isoa Rainima Crim. Case HAC 064 of 2017S 25th October 2018 may exceed the tariff when assessing all of the factors. That was a case committed against an adult victim. The total sentence came to 23 years imprisonment with a non- parole period of 20 years.”
 
 
8. “Sexual Assault”, contrary to section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009 carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
9. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows:
 (i) Breach of Trust. You are related to the child victim and you are her grandfather. As such, your role was to look after and care for her. In a village setting, that was expected of you. However, you abused the trust she had in you. Instead of looking after her, you committed the offences against her. This was done when no-one was around. You forced her to take her clothes off and committed the offences against her. She was 6 years old at the time.
 (ii) Rape of a child. We have said before and we will say again that we, the courts, will keep on passing heavy prison sentence against child rapists, as a warning to others.
 (iii) By offending against the child, you had shown no regards to her right as a child, her right as a human being and her right not to be harmed. You also had caused heartache and sadness to her family.
 
 
10. The mitigating factors were as follows:
 (i) At the age of 55 years, this was your first offence;
 (ii) You had been remanded in custody, awaiting trial, for approximately 1 year 3 days from 17 November 2017;
 (iii) Although you pleaded guilty to the charges approximately 1 year after first call in the High Court, you nevertheless saved some court time;
 (iv) You co-operated with the police during the interview process, by admitting the offence.
 
 
11. I will start with the rape offence, as it is the more serious of the two. On count no. 2, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 16 years imprisonment. For time already served while remanded in custody, I deduct 1 year 1 week, leaving a balance of 14 years 51 weeks. For your late guilty plea and for co- operating with police during the interview, I deduct 51 weeks, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment. For being a first offender at the age of 55 years, I deduct 2 years, leaving a balance of 12 years imprisonment. On count no. 2 (rape), I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
12. On the sexual assault charge (count no. 1), I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment.
 
 
13. The summary of your sentences are as follows:
 (i) Count no. 1 : Sexual Assault - 5 years imprisonment. 
 (ii) Count no. 2 : Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
14. Because of the totality principle of sentencing, I direct that the above sentences be made concurrent to each other, making a final total sentence of 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
15. Mr. Mataitoga Rogoivosa, for sexually offending against the child complainant on 1 November 2017 at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
16. Pursuant to section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the purpose of the above sentence is to punish you in a manner that is just in all the circumstances; to protect the community from people like you; to deter other people like you and to signify that the court and the community denounce what you did to the child complainant on 1 November 2017.
 
 
17. The child complainant’s name is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.
 
 
18. Pursuant to section 26 of the Domestic Violence Act 2009, I make a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order against the Accused to ensure the safety and well-being of the complainant.
 
 
19. You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Gates P
 
 
[1] I have read the draft judgment of Chandra J. I am in agreement with its conclusions and the reasoning for it. I concur with the orders proposed.
 
 
Chandra J
 
 
[2] The Petitioner seeks leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 27 May 2016 dismissing his appeal.
 
 
[3] At the hearing of the application of the Petitioner, Counsel of the Legal Aid Commission appeared and moved to withdraw from the case since the Petitioner was seeking to dispense with the services of the Legal Aid Commission and wanted to rely on the written submissions filed by him on the grounds set out in his notice of appeal.
 
 
[4] The Petitioner had by letter dated 13th June 2017 sent to the Legal Aid Commission with copy to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Registry of the Supreme Court indicated his decision to dispense with the assistance of the Legal Aid Commission and that he would be relying on his written submissions filed on the 11th day of January 2017.
 
 
[5] The application of Counsel for the Legal Aid commission to withdraw was allowed and the Petitioner was permitted to make submissions on his behalf.
 
 
[6] The Petitioner had filed his petition of appeal in June 2016 after the Court of Appeal had dismissed his appeal on 27 May 2016, but the appeal had been forwarded to the Registry by the Naboro Minimum Corrections Centre only on the 19th of July 2017 which was 11 days out of time. Although the application for leave to appeal was 11 days out of time, it was considered as a proper application as the delay in forwarding his application was by the Corrections Centre.
 
 
[7] The grounds of appeal set out in his application seeking leave to appeal are as follows:
 
  
•  That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to clearly direct the Assessors about each element of Rape that the prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
 
•  That his Lordships direction in relation to the burden and standard of proof was insufficient and not precise.
 
•  That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to direct the Assessors about the inconsistencies in the statement out of court and evidence on oath of the virtual complainant.

4. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in his summing up resulting in a miscarriage of justice, when he failed to direct the Assessors about the lies told in court about the virtual complainant.
 
5. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in his summing up, resulting in a miscarriage of justice when he failed to direct the assessors the following facts:
  
•  That are not bound by the expert opinion of Dr. Salma Hanif
 
•  The findings of Dr. Salma failed to specifically state that the hymen was not intact due to sexual activities.
 
•  The findings of Dr. Salma is inconsistent with the allegation of Rape.

6. That the conviction and the verdict is safe unsatisfactory having regard to evidence inconsistencies and misdirection.
 
 
Factual Background
 
[8] The Petitioner was charged in the High Court at Lautoka for 3 counts of indecent assault contrary to Section 154(1) and two counts of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code. After trial before three assessors, the learned High court Judge found the Petitioner guilty on counts 1, 2 and 5 for indecent assault and on counts 3 and 4 for rape as charged. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years.
 
 
[9] The victim, 14 years of age at the time of giving evidence (2012), was the daughter of the Petitioner. The charges spanned from the year 2006 to 2010. The victim was living with her father (Petitioner), mother, two brothers and a younger sister. In her evidence she recounted the events that she encountered. Her grandmother to whom she had complained also gave evidence. Medical evidence was led through Dr. Salma Hanif who stated in evidence that the hymen of the victim was not intact. The Petitioner did not give evidence nor did he lead any other evidence and relied on the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses.
 
 
[10] The Court of Appeal heard the arguments of the Petitioner on the grounds set out in his petition of appeal to the Court of Appeal which are different from the grounds of appeal filed in this Court. The grounds of appeal on which his appeal was argued before the Court of Appeal were as follows:
 
Against Conviction:
  
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and denied the appellant a fair hearing, because of non-disclosure before or during trial of a letter dated 9 November 2011 purporting the allegation against the appellant to be false and fabricated. 
 
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors how to approach the expert opinion evidence. 
 
•  That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up.

 Against Sentence:
  
• That the learned Judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to separately discount the 9 months the appellant had spent in remand.
 
• That the learned trial Judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature.
 
• That the sentence was in breach of section 14(2) (n) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji Islands.
 

[11] Of these grounds of appeal, the Petitioner had abandoned ground A of the grounds against conviction. 
 
 
[12] The grounds of appeal set out in his application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court would ex facie appear to be different from the grounds urged and argued before the Court of Appeal. However, grounds 1 to 4 and 6 relate to the summing up of the learned Trial Judge on different aspects and could be considered under ground C of the grounds of appeal urged before the Court of Appeal and Ground 5 can be considered under Ground B of the grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal. 
 
 
[13] The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is set out in Section 98(3) of the Constitution of Fiji which states:
 
“The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction, subject to such requirements as prescribed by written law, to hear and determine appeals from all final judgments of the Court of Appeal”.
 
 
Section 98(4) of the Constitution provides:
 
“An appeal may not be brought to the Supreme Court from a final Judgment of the Court of Appeal unless the Supreme Court grants leave to appeal.”
 
 
Section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act, 1998 provides: 
 
“In relation to a criminal matter, the Supreme Court must not grant special leave to appeal unless:
  
• A question of general legal importance is involved;
 
• A substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved; or
 
• Substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur.”
 

[14] The threshold set by Section 7(2) is very high unlike in an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal which is based on whether a ground of appeal is arguable. An appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court must satisfy the threshold for special leave to appeal in the first instance. The grounds of appeal should be in respect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. 
 
 
[15] In the present application the Petitioner has urged that grave and substantial injustice has been caused to him. However, he has not set out the manner in which the Court of Appeal has erred in its judgment which has caused such grave and substantial injustice. He has canvassed the same grounds of appeal before this Court.
 
[16] I reiterate the views expressed in Sachindra Nand Sharma v The State Criminal Appeal No.CAV 001 of 2016 (26 August 2016) where I cited Kosar Mahmood v HKSR FAMC No.31 of 2012 (unreported) by Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the following effect:
 
“We wish to stress that in all future applications on the substantial and grave injustice ground, the application for leave to appeal must identify the specific way in which it is submitted that the court below has departed from established legal norms; and why such departure is so seriously wrong that justice demands a hearing before the Court of Final Appeal notwithstanding the absence of any real controversy on any point of law of great and general importance. It will simply not be sufficient merely to set out the same arguments that were canvassed in the court below.” 
 
 
[17] In the present appeal what has to be seen is whether the grounds of appeal raised by the Petitioner give rise to a situation of grave and substantial miscarriage of justice for granting of leave.
 
 
Ground 1
 
[18] In this ground the Petitioner submitted that the learned trial Judge has failed to direct the Assessors regarding the elements of rape that have to be proved and referred to paragraph 17 of the summing up which states:
 
“[17] The offence of Rape is defined in the Penal Code and the Crimes Decree. According to our law the Prosecution should prove that the accused had carnal knowledge of the virtual complainant. In simple terms the Prosecution should prove that the Accused penetrated the vagina of the virtual complainant.”
 
 
[19] When the appeal was argued before the Court of Appeal, this aspect regarding the elements of rape had not been urged and therefore the Court of Appeal had not addressed its mind to same. 
 
[20] The Petitioner’s contention before this Court was that the direction of the learned Trial Judge was inadequate. The elements of rape were adverted to by the learned Trial Judge only in paragraph [17] cited above. It would appear that the learned Trial Judge has not stated anything about the consent of the victim. Counsel for the Respondent in his counter submissions stated that the victim in the case was under 13 years at the time of the commission of the rape and therefore the question of consent did not arise. On that basis it was his submission that there was no miscarriage of justice.
 
 
[21] It would have been better if the learned Trial Judge had elaborated more on the elements of Rape in his direction to the Assessors but since the question of consent was not material to the case before Court, there is no miscarriage of justice and therefore this ground would not assist the Petitioner.
 
 
Ground 2
 
[22] The second ground is that the directions of the learned Trial Judge on the burden and standard of proof were inadequate and reference was made to the fact that it was only mentioned in paragraph [5] of the summing up. This aspect of the summing up was not canvassed before the Court of Appeal and as a result the Court of Appeal had not addressed its mind to same.
 
 
[23] When considering the summing up of the learned Trial Judge, he has dealt with the burden and standard of proof in his summing up not only in paragraph [5] but also in paragraphs [29] and [33] of the summing up which was adequate. Therefore there has been no miscarriage of justice as urged by the Petitioner.
 
 
Grounds 3, 4 and 6
 
[24] Grounds 3 and 4 relate to the same aspect of the evidence of the victim and the summing up of the learned Trial Judge in relation to that evidence. It was the contention of the Petitioner that the evidence of the victim was inconsistent and that she had lied in her evidence.
 
[25] The Petitioner was emphasizing on the last answer given by the victim under cross examination. When she was asked whether she agreed that the complaint of rape is false she had answered in the affirmative. It was unfortunate that the prosecution nor the learned Trial Judge had sought any clarification regarding this answer given by the victim under cross examination. 
 
 
[26] The Court of Appeal dealt with this question and concluded thus:
 
“[24] I have reproduced the related questions and answers in paragraphs 10 and 11 of this judgment. It is unfortunate for both the prosecuting counsel as well as the learned judge to overlook the answer given by the victim to a question that was put to her. Having considered all the questions answers given I am of the view that the answer given as “yes” would have been nothing but a slip. The learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the failure of the learned counsel for the accused to address this issue in his address to the Assessors shows that this answer “yes” did not mean a denial of the incident. Omitting to refer to this solitary answer by the learned judge itself did not cause a miscarriage of justice.”
 
 
[27] The Court of Appeal had dealt with this question taking into account the entirety of the evidence at the trial and had arrived at the conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice. In view of that finding by the Court of Appeal these three grounds of appeal urged by the Petitioner would not have merit for granting leave to appeal.
 
 
Ground 5
 
[28] Ground 5 addresses the medical evidence led at the trial and the learned trial Judge’s direction to the assessors regarding same being inadequate.
 
 
[29] The Court of Appeal dealt with this question in detail and stated as follows:
 
“[19] The medical evidence is unchallenged. That evidence is that the hymen of the victim is not intact. At the time of giving evidence the victim was 14 years of age. There is no evidence of the victim associating with any males. The only man with whom she had had sex with was her own father. The medical opinion for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration. That is due to having had sex with someone. The doctor cannot say who that someone is. The victim’s evidence is that it is the father. Although it was suggested to the doctor that a girl of the age of the victim can lose the hymen due to vigorous sports activity, there is no such evidence. It is true that the learned judge had failed to analyse the evidence and explain that the Assessors are not bound by the opinion of the doctor that the losing of the hymen was due to vaginal penetration. The learned Judge said to the Assessors that they are Judges of facts. He also said that if an opinion had been expressed by him with regard to facts, that the Assessors are not obliged to accept it. The Assessors were told that they have to consider all the evidence and decide. It appears that there is no strict rule to say that the trial Judge is bound to tell the Assessors that they are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor. It was held in Fitzpatrick [1999] Crim. L. R. 832 that a failure slavishly to follow this formula does not automatically render a conviction unsafe. In this case I am of the view that it would have been better if the Judge said to the Assessors that they are not bound by the opinion expressed by the doctor that the reason for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration. In addition to the opinion expressed by the doctor the vaginal penetration has been established through the evidence of the victim and the grandmother. Therefore not giving a warning that the Assessors are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor cannot be considered as fatal. However by considering the fact that the evidence led was short and it not being a complex case, no prejudice was caused and no miscarriage of justice has occurred.”
 
 
[30] The Court of Appeal has dealt with this ground adequately and no error can be found regarding the conclusion reached regarding same. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
[31] In the above circumstances, as the application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of the Petitioner alleging grave and substantial miscarriage of justice has not satisfied the threshold required for granting such leave, his application is refused and the application is dismissed. 
 
 
Calanchini J
 
[32] I agree that leave to appeal should be refused.

271661,"Judgment : 12 October 2018 
 
Date of Punishment : 19 October 2018
 
 
The name of the complainant is suppressed. Accordingly, the complainant will be referred to as “MW”.
 
 
PUNISHMENT
 
 
[1] Stan Davidson Ramere (Stan), in terms of the Amended Information filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), you were charged, along with Eparama Warua, with the following offences:
 
COUNT 1
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
STAN DAVIDSON RAMERE, on 4 June 2011, at Labasa in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of MW, with his penis, without her consent.
 
 
COUNT 2
 
Statement of Offence
 
AIDING AND ABETTING: Contrary to Section 45 and 207 [1] and [2] [a] of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
EPARAMA WARUA, on 4 June 2011, at Labasa in the Northern Division, aided and abetted STAN DAVIDSON RAMERE to penetrate the vagina of MW, with his penis, without her consent. 
 
[2] Count 1 was the relevant charge against you.
 
[3] You pleaded not guilty to charge against you and the ensuing trial was held over 2 days.
 
[4] At the conclusion of the evidence and after the directions given in the summing up, by a unanimous decision, the three Assessors found you not guilty of Rape. However, by their unanimous decision the three Assessors found you guilty of the lesser or the alternative charge of Defilement of a Young Person between 13 and 16 Years of Age (Defilement), contrary to section 215(1) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009 (Crimes Act). 
 
[5] Having reviewed the evidence, this Court was of the opinion that the unanimous decision of the Assessors in finding you guilty of Defilement was justified. In the circumstances, Court found you guilty and convicted you of Defilement.
 
[6] At the time of the incident, you were 15 years of age, and as such a juvenile. 
 
[7] In terms of the Juveniles Act (as amended) a ""juvenile"" has been defined to mean a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years, and includes a child and a young person. A ""child"" means a person who has not attained the age of fourteen years; while a ""young person"" means a person who has attained the age of fourteen years, but who has not attained the age of eighteen years.
 
[8] Furthermore, Section 20 of the Juveniles Act stipulates that “The words ""conviction"" and ""sentence"" shall not be used in relation to juveniles and any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of juvenile persons, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.”
 
[9] In terms of Section 20 of the Juveniles Act, it is clear that the words ""conviction"" and ""sentence"" shall not be used in relation to juveniles. Thus the reference made by me in my Judgment, dated 12 October 2018, that you have been “convicted” has been made ‘per incuriam’. Court could only have made a finding of guilt against you. 
 
[10] Pursuant to the said finding of guilt, I now proceed to impose the punishment against you.
 
[11] Section 30 of the Juveniles Act imposes certain restrictions on the punishments which Courts could order against juvenile offenders. The Section provides that:
 
“(1) No child shall be ordered to be imprisoned for any offence.

(2) No young person shall be ordered to be imprisoned for an offence, or to be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine, damages or costs, unless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in an approved institution or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained.
 
(3) A young person shall not be ordered to be imprisoned for more than two years for any offence.”
 
Emphasis is mine.
 
[12] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act No. 42 of 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”) stipulates the relevant factors that a Court should take into account during the sentencing process. I have duly considered these factors in determining the punishment to be imposed on you. 
 
[13] In terms of Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act, “(1) A person commits a summary offence if he or she unlawfully and carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any person being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of 16 years.”
 
[14] The offence of Defilement in terms of Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
 
[15] As at 4 June 2011, the complainant was 13 years and 5 months old. Her date of birth is 12 January 1998.
 
[16] The applicable tariff for the offence of Defilement is a suspended sentence to 4 years imprisonment. The law and tariff in relation to the offence of Defilement remains the same as found in the Penal Code (Chapter 17).
 
[17] In Livinai Namami v. The State [1979] FCA 55; [1995] 41 FLR 152 (17 July 1995); where the accused appellant appealed the sentence of 2½ years imprisonment on a charge of Defilement of his girlfriend, aged 15½ years, His Lordship Justice Fatiaki held:
 
“......On the facts of this case there can be little doubt that this was a case of ""a virtuous friendship (between two young people) that ended with them having sexual intercourse with one another."" Certainly it falls within that category of offending where ""... it is inappropriate to pass sentences of a punitive nature.""
 
In this case the learned trial magistrate sentenced the appellant on an incorrect factual basis in that the complainant was not then under 15 years of age at the time of the offence. Furthermore no consideration appears to have been given to the minimal age difference between the parties and finally, as conceded by learned State counsel, there is no record that the learned trial magistrate was aware that the appellant was a student at the time of sentencing him.
 
Insofar as it may be possible to give some guidance in the matter, on a charge of Defilement under Section 156(1) (a) of the Penal Code (Cap. 17), this Court is firmly of the view that in the absence of aggravating factors and subject to a favourable Social Welfare Officer's report, where the age difference between the accused and the complainant is less than 4 years, a non-custodial sentence is appropriate.
 
In the light of the above and for the foregoing reasons the appeal was allowed and the appellant and his father were ordered to enter into a recognizance of $100 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months and further conditioned that the appellant was not to associate with the complainant.”
 
 [18] In State v Kabaura [2010] FJHC 280; HAC117.2010 (9 August 2010); His Lordship Justice Goundar said:
“The tariff for this offence is from a suspended sentence to four years imprisonment; suspended sentences reserved for virtuous friendship offending while the higher side of the range is for offenders who are older and in position of trust with the victim (Etonia Rokowaqa v. State Criminal Appeal No. HAA37 of 2004); Elia Donumainasuva v. State Criminal Appeal No. HAA032 of 2001).”
 
[19] This tariff was followed by His Lordship Justice Madiagan in State v Raovuna [2011] FJHC 59; HAC 021.2010 (10 February 2011) where he stated: 
 
‘’The facts at trial revealed that in the last week of May 2010, you (the accused) had gone to stay with your uncle at Seaqaqa. While there you came into contact with the victim Katarina and you and she had several meetings over 3 days and you each considered the other to be a romantic friend. On the evening of the 30th May 2010, you and Katarina found yourselves at a house in the settlement where sexual intercourse took place between you. The assessors and the court were obviously of the view that it was consensual.’’
 
 [20] Similarly, in State v Raibevu [2012] FJHC 1040; HAC27.2011 (27 April 2012); His Lordship Justice Madiagan held: 
 
“.....the usual range of sentences (for Defilement) is from a suspended sentence for protagonists in a ""virtuous relationship"" whilst the higher end of the range is for offenders who are older and in a position of trust. (Rokowaqa CA 37/2004, Kabaura HAC 117/2010). In the case of Donumainasuva CA 32/2001, Shameem, J said ""The offence is clearly designed to protect young girls who have entered puberty and experiencing social and hormonal changes, from sexual exploitation.""
 
 [21] In the case of State v Vetaukula [2014] FJHC 500; HAC46.2013 (8 July 2014); the accused, who was the turaga-ni-koro of the village, and who pleaded guilty to the defilement of a 15 year old girl in the same village, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Goundar J said:
 
“The maximum penalty for defilement is 10 years imprisonment. The tariff is between suspended sentences to 4 years imprisonment (Elia Donumainasava v State [2001] HAA 32/01S, 18 May 2001). Suspended sentences are appropriate in cases of non-exploitative relationship between persons of similar age. Custodial sentences are appropriate in cases of sexual exploitation of younger girls by old men or men who hold positions of authority over the girls.”
 
[22] It is the opinion of this Court, that considering the facts of this case, there are no aggravating factors. 
 
[23] Stan, in mitigation you have submitted as follows: 
 
(i) That you are a first offender and that there have been no previous findings of guilt recorded against you to date. The State too confirms this position.
 
(ii) That you fully cooperated with the Police when you were taken in for questioning and subsequently charged instead of trying to circumvent the course of justice. 
 
(iii) You admitted to the offence whilst testifying in Court. Thus, you have acknowledged that what you did was wrong and inexcusable. You have sought forgiveness from this Court and have assured that you will not re-offend. You have submitted that you are gravely remorseful of your actions. 
 
(iv) There has been an unfortunate history of delay prior to this matter being transferred to the High Court and taken up for trial. 
 
[24] Considering all the aforementioned factors, and the restrictions placed on this Court in terms of the provisions of Section 30(3) of the Juveniles Act, I impose on you a punishment of 12 months imprisonment.
 
[25] The next issue for consideration is whether your punishment should be suspended.
 
[26] Section 26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act provides as follows:
 
(1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances. 
 
(2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence,— 
 
(a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or 
 
(b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrate’s Court. 
 
[27] Stan, you are now 22 years of age. You have admitted that what you did was wrong, and taken full responsibility for your actions. You have also promised that you would lead a crime free life if you are granted a non-custodial punishment. 
 
[28] In Singh & Others v. State [2000] FJHC 115; HAA 79J of 2000S (26 October 2000); Her Ladyship Madam Justice Shameem held: 
 
 “....However as a general rule, leniency is shown to first offenders, young offenders, and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse.....”
 
[29] Her Ladyship Madam Justice Shameem also held In Nariva v. The State [2006] FJHC 6; HAA 148J.2005S (9 February 2006);
 
“The courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment.”
 
[30] I have considered the following circumstances: 
  
• You are a young offender;
 
• You have been of previous good character;
 
• You have fully cooperated with the Police;
 
• You have accepted responsibility for your conduct;
 
• You submit that you are truly remorseful of your actions and have sought forgiveness from this Court;
 
• You have assured Court that you will not re-offend. 
 

Accordingly, it is my opinion that the chances for your rehabilitation is high. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to suspend your punishment. Accordingly, I suspend your punishment for a period of 3 years. The juvenile is advised of the effect of breaching a suspended punishment. 
 
 
[31] In the result, your final punishment would be 12 months imprisonment, which term of imprisonment is suspended for a period of 3 years. 
 
[32] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal if you so wish.

269299,"SENTENCE
 
  
• Mr. Penaia Salakubou, you have been charged with one count of Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm, contrary to Section 255 (a) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The particulars of the offence are that:
 

COUNT ONE
 
 
Statement of Offence (a)
 
ACT WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to Section 255 (a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
 Particulars of Offence (b)
 
PENAIA SALAKUBOU on the 3rd day of August 2018, at Labasa, in the Northern Division, with intent to do some grievous harm to MONIKA TINAIRAVONU unlawfully wounded the said MONIKA TINAIRAVONU.
 
  
• You pleaded guilty to this offence on the 11th of October 2018 before Justice Hamza. Having perused the record of the proceedings pertaining to the 11th of October 2018 and the re-confirmation of the plea of guilty, I then proceeded to provide the summary of facts to the accused, which he admitted in open court. Satisfied by the fact that you have fully comprehended the legal effect of your plea and your plea was voluntary and free from influence, I now convict you to this offence.
 
 
• It was revealed in the summary of facts, which you admitted in the court that you have asked the complainant to go into the bedroom. The complainant is your de-facto wife. Once she entered into the bedroom you have closed the door and the windows of the room. You have then started to throw punches at the complainant on her head and the eyes. You have then held her neck to choke her. Subsequently, you had stuck her with an object. Having repeatedly assaulted her, you have walked out of the room, leaving the complainant unattended with her wounds. 
 
 
• This is a case of domestic violence where the de-facto husband had used physical violence on the de-facto wife. There is no excuse for causing physical harm and violence on family members. The law and also the society have denounced such crimes on the family members without any reservations. Such acts of violence undoubtedly attract immediate custodial sentences, unless there is an exceptional circumstances to do otherwise. Therefore, I find this is a very serious crime. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this offence, the purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence and protection of community. 
 
• The sentencing tariff for the offence of Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm is between six (6) months to five (5) years imprisonment period. 
 
 
• You have taken the complainant into the room and locked her inside by closing the door and windows before you have unleashed your brutal assault on her. Neither she had any prospect of protecting herself nor escaping from the room. It is clear that this was a premeditated act. Therefore, I find the level of harm and the culpability in this offending is significantly high. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of the offence, the level of capability and harm, I select two (2) years as the starting point for this sentence. 
 
 
• You have breached the trust that the complainant had for you as her de-facto husband. You had walked out of the room, leaving the wounded complainant unattended in the room. Due to this incident, the complainant had to leave her house. I consider these factors as aggravating grounds. 
 
 
• In view of these aggravating factors, I increase two (2) years to reach four (4) years of interim imprisonment. 
 
 
• You are a first offender. You have three young children. Having taken into consideration your previous character and family backgrounds, I deduct one (1) year and reach to three (3) years imprisonment.
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for this offence at the first available opportunity, which demonstrates your remorse and repent in committing this crime. Hence, I give you a substantive discount for your early plea of guilty and remorse. Therefore I reduce further one (1) year. Accordingly, your final sentence is two (2) years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In view of the serious nature of this offence, I do not find any appropriate reasons to suspend your sentence. 
 
• Taking into consideration your age, opportunities for rehabilitation and the seriousness of this offence, I find one (1) year of non-parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence. 
 

Head Sentence
 
  
• Accordingly, I sentence you to a period of two (2) years for this offence of Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm, contrary to Section 255 (a) of the Crimes Act. I further order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of one (1) year. 
 

Actual Period of the Sentence
 
  
• You have been in remand custody for this case for a period of nearly two (2) months as you were not granted bail by the Court. In pursuant of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider the period of two months (2) as the period of imprisonment that have already been served by you.
 
 
• Accordingly, your actual sentencing period is one (1) year and ten (10) months of imprisonment period with non-parole period of ten (10) months. 
 

Domestic Violence Restraining Order
 
  
• Since this incident involves with Domestic Violence, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the Domestic Violence Act. I accordingly make a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order against you with standard non-molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to section 24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Act. The above Domestic Violence Restraining Order will be in force until this court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it. Furthermore, if you breached this restraining order, you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of Section 77 of the Domestic Violence Act. 
 
 
• Thirty (30) days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

253037,"SENTENCE
 
[1]. Mr. Inoke Salayavi, you were charged on following Information.
 
COUNT 1
 
Statement of Offence
 
 ASSAULT CAUSING ACTUAL BODILY HARM: Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 INOKE SALAYAVI on the 2nd day of October 2016 at Rakiraki in the Western Division assaulted SHARON MATAI thereby causing her actual bodily harm.
 
COUNT 2
 
Statement of Offence
 
 RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 INOKE SALAYAVI on the 2nd day of October 2016 at Rakiraki in the Western Division penetrated the vagina of SHARON MATAI with his fingers.
 
[2]. You pleaded guilty to both counts on your own free will when you were represented by a legal counsel. When I explained the consequence of the guilty plea and the tariff range of the sentence, you understood what I explained and maintained your position. I accepted your plea after being satisfied that it was unequivocal, voluntary and free from any influence. 
 
[3]. On the 3rd of March, 2017 you agreed the summary of facts filed by the State. I found the two counts in the Information proved on facts agreed by you. You were convicted on both counts accordingly. I now proceed to sentence you as follows: 
 
[4]. The summary of facts filed by the State was that: 
 
On the 2nd day of October 2016 at about 9.00 am at Dranivau Village, your wife was at home when you entered the house and approached her. You started to question your wife alleging her of extra-marital affairs which leads to a heated argument between you and your wife. You then punched her on the face and then left towards the kitchen. Your wife then lied down on the mattress in the bedroom since she felt body pain as she was three (3) months pregnant at that time.
 
 
Whilst your wife was lying down, you returned to her and then pressed her buttocks. She tried to push you away but was unsuccessful as you were strong. You then forcefully spread her legs and forcefully inserted your finger in her vagina and started to poke it. Your wife felt pain in her vagina. Your wife tried to stop you but she could not. After doing this then walked out of the house.
 
 
Your wife then reported the matter at the Rakiraki Police Station and she was taken for medical examination at the Rakiraki Hospital. You were then arrested and interviewed under caution. You admitted assaulting and raping your wife. 
 
 
Maximum Sentence
 
[5]. The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment. 
 
Tariff for Rape
 
[6]. The tariff for rape in Fiji is well settled. When the victim is an adult, a minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment should be imposed. 
 
 
[7]. In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, Fiji Court of Appeal observed:
 
 
“While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this Court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.”
 
 
[8]. Maximum punishment prescribed for Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm is imprisonment for 5 years. The tariff rangers from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months’ imprisonment. (State v. Tugalala (2008) FJHC 78; HAC 025/2008S).
 
 
[9]. In State v. Tugalala (supra) Justice Shameem said: 
 
 
“The tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. The High Court said in Elizabeth Joseph v. The State [2004] HAA 030/04S and State v. Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA 073/04S, that it is the extent of the injury which determines  sentence. The use of a pen knife for instance, justifies a higher starting point. Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing  hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld (Amasai Korovata v. The State [2006] HAA 115/06S.”
 
 
[10]. Statistics for domestic violence in Fiji are always awful. For some spouses, this can include rape. Most of the cases do not come to light because some victims think the sustainability of marriage is far more important and don’t take trouble to complain. Some of them remain passive partners due to ignorance, shame, fear or cultural taboos. It is incredible to think before 1992, that a man could rape his wife. The wife was deemed to consent to sexual intercourse on marrying the husband. In R v R [1992] AC 599 the House of Lords recognized the sexual autonomy of a spouse within institution of marriage and the requirement for the prosecution to prove that sexual intercourse had taken place outside marriage was abandoned. 
 
 
[11]. State v Ismail [2014] FJHC 628; HAC115.2012 (26 August 2014) Janaka Bandara J observed:
 
 
“The law pertaining to ""Rape"" is well settled in this jurisdiction. When the victim is over thirteen (13) years, 'consent' is an essential element to have sexual intercourse. In other words, what matters is the ""consent"", but not the ""relationship"" the perpetrator shares with the ""victim"". In the eyes of the Law, irrespective of their gender, everybody is equal and treated equally. A spouse is of no exception. If a wife is compelled to have sexual intercourse or oral or anal sex against her will by the use of authority, force or by threat of using force, she has a right to say 'NO' to such sexual demands of a husband. If the husband decides to proceed ahead despite of that 'NO', he risks of being criminally liable for raping his own wife”.
 
 
[12]. This sentence is passed not only to denounce your offending and punish you. But also to send a clear massage to the society that marital rape, the worst form of domestic violence is no longer tolerated in Fiji. When sexual intimacy is egoistically used to despoil marital union in order to advance a felonious urge for coitus by force, violence or intimidation, the court will step into protect sanctity of marriage, vindicate justice and protect our laws and State policies. 
 
[13]. You committed these offences on your wife who was three months pregnant at that time. You also used violence on her in addition to the digital penetration, an act in itself constituted violence. A man who penetrates his wife without her consent commits sexual violence in a domestic relationship. Marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity. Having considered high culpability factors and the harm caused to the victim, I take 9 years as the starting point for the offence of Rape Count before taking into consideration the aggravating and mitigation factors.
 
 
Aggravating factors
 
 
[14]. You breached the trust the complainant placed on you in that she trusted you as her husband.
 
 
[15]. You committed this offence whilst on license.
 
 
[16]. You exploited the vulnerability of your pregnant wife. 
 
 
Mitigating Factors
 
 
[17]. I take into account the mitigating factors submitted on your behalf. You are a first offender. You are a 42 years old farmer and you look after your family. You are a father of three children and your wife is expecting the fourth child. 
 
 
[18]. You co-operated with the police. 
 
 
[19]. You admitted the offences at the caution interview and pleaded guilty to the charge at the first available opportunity. In doing so, you saved precious time and resources of this court and also saved your wife from going through the ordeal again in this court. You seek forgiveness of this Court and of your wife. Your wife indicated to this Court that she accepted the apology you tendered. I accept your remorse as genuine. 
 
 
[20]. I understand the difficult situation your wife and children are getting into when they are separated from you. Your dependents should not suffer and be punished for the wrong you have committed. However, I have no other option than to apply the law and sentencing principles of this country and send you to a correction centre. However, I have considered this mitigating factor into consideration in deciding your non- parole period. 
 
 
[21]. I add two years to the starting point of nine years’ for aggravating factors bringing the interim sentence to 11 years. I deduct three years for your mitigating factors mentioned above.
 
 
[22]. Now your sentence for the Rape count is 8 years’ imprisonment. 
 
 
[23]. I took same mitigating factors discussed above into consideration in deciding your sentence for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm. 
 
 
[24]. I sentence you to 6 months imprisonment for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily harm in Count No. 2.
 
 
[25]. Therefore your final sentence is:
 
 
Count No. 1 – Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm  – 6 months imprisonment
 
Count No. 2 – Rape - 8 years’ imprisonment.
 
 
[26] Both sentences in Counts No. 1 and 2 are to run concurrently. 
 
 
[27]. Your non-parole period will be five years. You will be eligible for parole after five years.
 
 
 [28]. 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

79200,"JUDGMENT

	1.	The appellant was charged before the Tavua Magistrate under the following count:

Statement of Offence

ASSAULT CAUSING ACTUAL BODILY HARM:- Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of the Offence

PRANAY PRATAP KISSUN, on the 14th day of April 2013 at Tavua in the Western Division, assaulted ROSELYN PRASAD thereby causing her actual bodily harm.

	1.	The appellant pleaded guilty, convicted and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years on 1st July 2013. 

	2.	The facts of the case are on 14th April 2013 at home, the victim was asking her child to do some house work which was not liked by the victim's mother in law. Victim had told mother in law not to interfere as she wants her daughter to learn. There was heated argument between victim and the mother in law. The appellant who is the husband of the victim asked the victim why she was rude to his mother. Then appellant held the victim by neck and pushed her out side.

	3.	This appeal was filed on 9th July 2013 within time.

	4.	The grounds of appeal are:

Appeal against the conviction:

(a) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in convicting the Appellant when he failed to consider all aspects and/or all relevant matters of mitigation into account.
		(i) Failing to consider the fact that the complainant had written a letter withdrawing the complaint;

		(ii) Failing to consider the emails attached to the typed mitigation submitted to the Court;

		(iii) Failing to consider the effect of conviction on the well being of the family and the likely effect on the marriage between the parties;

		(iv) Failing to consider the continued support by the accused of his family despite the affair of his wife with another man and the reasons why he had lost his job with Big Rooster.


(b) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in concluding that there was no provocation in the matter particularly in view of the emails attached to the mitigation.

(c) That learned Trial Magistrate's decision in entering a conviction was manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in principal and in the exercise of his discretion in all the circumstances of the case.

(d) That the learned Trial Magistrate's application and/or interpretation of the case of State v David Batiratu Revision Case No. HAR 001/2012 is with respect incorrect particularly also in view of considering Section 9 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

(e) That the learned Trial Magistrate failed to exercise his discretion under Section 15,16, and 45 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, which discretion he has under the said provisions.

(f) That the appellant reserves his right to add to the above grounds of appeal upon receipt of the Court records in this matter.
Appeal against the sentence

(a) That the appellant appeal against the sentence being manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in principal in all the circumstances of the case.

(b) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the appellant and also not taking into relevant considerations.
		(i) Failing to consider the fact the complainant had written a letter withdrawing the complaint;

(ii) Failing to consider the emails attached to the typed mitigation;

(iii) Failing to consider the effect of conviction on the well being of the family and the likely effect on the marriage between the parties;

(iv) Failing to consider the continued support by the accused of his family despite the affair of his wife with another man and the reasons why he had lost his job with Big Rooster.

(c) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in considering the prevalence of offence as aggravating factor.

(d) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact when considering the lack of provocation and aggravating factor when clearly pursuant to the emails attached to the mitigation there was provocation.

(e) That the learned Trial Magistrate's application and/or interpretation of the case of State v David Batiratu Revision Case No. HAR 001/2012 is with respect incorrect particularly also in view of considering Section 9 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

(f) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 and in particular Sections 4,5,9,15,16 and 45 when sentencing the appellant.
Appeal against the conviction:

	1.	The appellant had pleaded guilty to the count against him and admitted the summary of facts on 24.6.2013.

	2.	In the written submissions of mitigation filed by the appellant before the learned Magistrate he had prayed for dismissal of the charge without recording a conviction acting under Sections 15(1) (j), 16 (1) and 45 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree on the basis that such conviction will jeopardize his prospects of employment. 

	3.	The learned Magistrate had considered the question whether it would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case to enter a no conviction against the appellant and to discharge him.

	4.	He had considered the judgment of State v Kumar [2001] FJHC 101; HAA 0014.2001l(2 February 2001), where it was held that:

""The Court in its sentencing remarks said rightly, it was faced with a very awkward situation for this accused was facing dismissal from his employment if a conviction were to be entered. Nevertheless a discharge without conviction being entered was not an appropriate sentence here. Absolute discharges are appropriate only in limited number of circumstances, such as where no moral blame attaches(R v O'Toole (1971) 55 Cr App p 206) or where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred, perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty (R v Kavanagh (unreported) May 16th 1972 CA)""

	1.	Further the case of State v David Batiratu Revisional Case No. HAR001/2012 was also considered by the learned Magistrate. It was held in that case by the Hon. Chief Justice that:

""The effect of the cases and the purport of the more detailed provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree with regard to discharges can be summarized. If a discharge without conviction is urged upon the Court the sentencer must consider the following question, whether:

(a) The offender is morally blameless.
(b) Whether only a technical breach in the law has occurred.
(c) Whether the offence is of a trivial and minor nature.
(d) Whether the public interest in the enforcement and effectiveness of the legislation is such that escape from penalty is not consistent with that interest.
(e) Whether circumstances exist in which it is appropriate to record a conviction, or merely to impose nominal punishment.
(f) Are there any other extenuating or exceptional circumstances, a rare situation, justifying a court showing mercy to an offender.""
	1.	The learned Magistrate then stated that:

""When considering the above questions, the offender in this case cannot be said to be morally blameless. The offending was deliberate and there's no technical breach of the law. In addition as noted earlier the nature of the offending in this case is serious and not trivial. It is domestic violence offence and due to its seriousness it is no longer a reconcilable offence. In the public interest and to ensure that enforcement of the law is effective, a punishment is warranted due to seriousness of the charge. There are no exceptional circumstances in this case that justify no conviction to be entered and offender to be discharged. Therefore in exercising my discretion a conviction will have to be entered and as it would be wrong in principle to discharge you without conviction.""

	1.	I totally agree with the observations of the learned Magistrate in the back ground of the cited authorities. 

	2.	Further in State v Kumar [2001] FJHC 340;[2001] 2FLR 225 (25 July 2001) it was held by His Lordship Anthony Gates that:

""The respondent, prior to the sentence, has suffered in various ways. The case went through many adjournments in the Magistrates' Court. For nearly 3 years he suffered interdiction without pay. This had the equivalent effect of a substantial time. His wife had earlier left him. He was trying to look after the two children, to whom he had to act as mother and father. I had been informed that he was to pay $100 to the complainant as compensation, which compensation the victim has now confirmed has been paid. Upon the basis that a punishment, if it were to result in the loss of the respondent's livelihood with the police, would be disproportionate to the crime committed, I ordered that the Respondent be discharged absolute without conviction entered. This cannot be a precedent however for the imposition of absolute discharges in cases of this sort.""

	1.	It was cited in approval the reasoning of Richard J in Fisheries Inspector v Turner[1978] 2 NZLR 233 at p241 who described the extend of the sentencing discretion for a section not very different from section 44 of the Fiji's Penal Code:

""In considering the exercise of the discretion under s42 the Court is required to balance all the relevant public interest considerations that apply in the particular case; or; as s42 (1) puts it, 'after inquiry into the circumstances of the case', which must refer to all circumstances that are relevant in the particular case before the Court. It must have due regard to the nature of the offence and the gravity with which it is viewed by Parliament; to the seriousness of the particular offending; to the circumstances of the particular offender in terms of the effect on his career, his pocket, his reputation and any civil disabilities consequential on conviction; and to any other relevant circumstances. And if the direct and indirect consequences of a conviction are in Court's judgment, out of all proportion to the gravity of the offence, it is proper for the a discharge to be given under s42.""

	1.	The appellant by his counsel had submitted that the learned Magistrate should have taken Section 16(1) (c) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree into consideration and not order a conviction to be entered. He submits that as he is a first offender and there is reconciliation it is a suitable case for not recording a conviction. 

	2.	Section 16 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree reads as follows:

""Section 16 (1) In exercising his discretion whether or not record a conviction, a Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including-..............

(a) The nature of the offence;
(b) The character and past history of the offender; and
(c) The impact of a conviction on the offender's economic or social well-being, and on his or her employment prospects.""
	1.	The operative word in this section is ""discretion"". Where the Magistrate had exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power that it would be in very exceptional circumstances that an appellate Court would interfere with that exercise.

	2.	This is particularly so in cases of Domestic Violence which this case is. The Domestic Violence Decree is clearly a Decree to provide greater protection from Domestic Violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not to record a conviction against a perpetrator. 

	3.	Further according to Section 154 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Decree promotion of reconciliation is not applicable to offences of Domestic Violence, as defined by the Domestic Violence Decree, 2009.

	4.	The appellant had pleaded guilty to the offence and had admitted the summary of facts which go to the elements of the offence. The learned Magistrate had exercised his discretion correctly.
Thus there is merit in the grounds against the conviction and those fails. 

	1.	The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.

Appeal against the sentence

	1.	The learned Magistrate had taken a starting point of 9 months. For aggravating factors namely the prevalence of the offence in community and lack of provocation he had added 2 months. This being the first offence and other mitigating factors 2 months was reduced. Further 3 months were reduced for the guilty plea arriving at a sentence of 6 months. 

	2.	Then the learned Magistrate had considered the suspension of the sentence. He had stated that 'Although the nature of the offending was unprovoked, this is your first offence and you need to be given opportunity to reform yourself. Therefore I am going to suspend your sentence.'

	3.	The sentence of 6 months imprisonment was suspended for 2 years. Further he had made permanent the interim restraining orders made under Section 27 (2) of the Domestic Violence Decree on 18th April 2013.

	4.	The learned Magistrate had followed the following tariff judgments.

State v Salote Tugalala HAC 25 of 2008
Elizabeth Joseph v The state [2004] HAA 030.2004S
State v Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA 073 .2004S
Amasi Korovata v The State [2006] HAA 115.2006S

According to these judgments the tariff for the offence of Common Assault and Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. In State v Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA 073 .2004S it is stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence........ Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases sentence of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld. (Amasi Korovata v The State [2006] HAA 115.2006S)

	1.	In Raisoqoni v State [2011] FJHC 32; HAA 004.2011 (7 February 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Daniel Gounder held that:

'The Domestic Violence Decree has changed the old law. Under the new law, domestic violence offences are not reconcilable and therefore there is no discretion given to the courts to encourage reconciliation. However, if the victim freely reconciles with the partner and gives evidence of that effect, reconciliation is a factor that ought to be taken into account in sentencing the offender........The term of six months imprisonment was within the tariff and was arrived at after all relevant factors were taken into account.'

	1.	In State v Kumar [2011] FJHC 341; HAA 020.2010(9 June 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'A domestic violence offence which this obviously is cannot be reconciled and in any event the Court record notes that the victim did not want to reconcile. It is incumbent upon the tribunal or officer of the Court to have regard to the Domestic Violence Decree which came into force on the 1st of December 2009. The Decree was enacted to protect persons, men women and children, from abuse in domestic environment and if the Courts do not make findings and rulings within the spirit of the Decree, then that altruistic arm is thwarted.'

Setting aside a penalty of $100 compensation, a term of 6 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years was ordered in this case.

	1.	In Chand v State [2011] FJHC 593; HAA 024.2011 (23 September 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'Assaults in a domestic context are particularly odious in that wives, and husband for that matter, should feel safe in their homes without having their trust I their loved ones betrayed. The learned Magistrate was quite correct in finding that the domestic element to this offending was an aggravating feature.'

	1.	In Botaki v State [2012] FJHC 1250; HAA 015.2012 (1 August 2012) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'The question of reconciliation in a Domestic Violence is a difficult one. It is quite clear that it is not a reconcilable offence, it being a domestic violence case and that being so, reconciliation as a mitigating factor is of very dubious value. A female victim will nearly always say that the parties are reconciled because she will fear the loss of the family breadwinner and supporter or she is forced to say it by her accused husband. A sentencing tribunal should always therefore look at a submission of reconciliation with great caution and suspicion. In this case, although the Magistrate has listed reconciliation as a mitigating factor, he later expresses doubts whether it was voluntary or not because the victim did not confirm it in Court. It was a submission of the accused.'

	1.	The learned Magistrate had not mentioned that he considered reconciliation as a ground of mitigation. However, he had deducted 2 months for mitigation. In the circumstances the learned Magistrate is justified in making that deduction for all the mitigation.

	2.	The sentence is well within the accepted tariff for the offence. The Magistrate has not made any error of law in passing the sentence, and in the circumstances it is entirely appropriate sentence. The appeal against the sentence has no merit and is dismissed.

	3.	For the reasons given above the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

248796,"SENTENCE
 
  
• Inoke Lagivere, you stand convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to section 215(1) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
• In brief, you had sexual intercourse with the victim who was 14 years old at the material time. The victim and you are related as cousins. You were 27 years old at the time of the offence. When you gave evidence, you admitted that you solicited the victim to have sexual intercourse with you.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 215(1) of the Crimes Act 2009 read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the maximum punishment for defilement is an imprisonment for 10 years.
 
 
• The offence of defilement under section 215(1) of the Crimes Act is designed to protect young girls below the age of 16 years and above the age of 13 years who may be physically ready to have sexual intercourse with the onset of puberty from sexual exploitation until they attain a certain level of maturity.
 
 
• Based on the previous sentencing decisions I concluded in the case of State v Chand (2016) FJHC 889; HAC314.2015 (6 October 2016) that the sentencing tariff for the offence of defilement of young person between 13 and 16 years of age under section 215(1) of the Crimes Act is 2 to 4 years. However, as I highlighted in Chand (supra), 4 years imprisonment was taken as the higher end of the tariff when the maximum sentence for the offence of defilement of girl between thirteen and sixteen years of age (under section 156 of the Penal Code) was 5 years imprisonment.
 
 
• It is pertinent to note that the tariff for the offence of indecent assault is 12 months imprisonment to 4 years where the offence of indecent assault carries a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment under the Crimes Act. This sentencing tariff was also established when the Penal Code was in force and the maximum sentence for the offence of indecent assault under section 154 of the Penal Code is also 5 years imprisonment. However, the maximum sentence for the offence of defilement of a person between 13 and 16 years of age is now an imprisonment term of 10 years as I have stated above.
 
 
• Therefore, in my view, the question as to whether the higher end of the sentencing tariff of the offence of defilement of young person between 13 and 16 years of age under section 215(1) of the Crimes Act should be increased in order to give effect to the intention of the lawgivers need to be considered in an appropriate case.
 
• I take 02 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• You are related to the victim as an elder cousin. You were in a position of trust;
 
• The age difference between you and the victim is 13 years;
 
• You took advantage of the victim’s naivety.
 

 
• I consider the following as mitigating factors;  
• You are a first offender; and
 
• You had cooperated with the police. 
 

 
• Considering the above aggravating factors I add 02 years to the starting point and in view of the mitigating factors I deduct 01 year of your sentence. 
 
 
• Accordingly, I hereby sentence you for a term of 03 years imprisonment. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 01 year and 06 months of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Act reads thus;

“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• You have spent about 04 months in custody in relation to this matter. In view of the provisions of section 24 of the sentencing and Penalties Act 2009 the period you have been in custody for this case shall be regarded as time already served by you. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 04 months.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to 03 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 01 year and 06 months. Considering the period spent in custody, the time remaining to be served is;

Head Sentence – 02 years and 08 months
 
Non-parole period – 01 year and 02 months
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

	1.	NIRAJ KIRAN PRASAD , you were convicted after a trial for one count of Defilement contrary to section 214(1) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

	2.	During the trial it was revealed that on 21st August 2010 you had unlawful carnal knowledge with Ms. LN ( name suppressed) who was 13 years old at that time . 

	3.	Both parties have filed submissions which I have also considered for this sentence. 

	4.	Maximum penalty for this offence under the Crimes Decree is life imprisonment. 

	5.	In John Peter Vunilagi v State (Criminal Appeal Case no. 075 of 2004 and HAA076 of 2004) appellant was sentenced in the Magistrates Court for 6 years imprisonment for defilement of a girl under 13 years of age and sitting in appeal Shameem J had made following comments whilst upholding a sentence of 6 years imprisonment.

""In respect of defilement of girls under the age of 13, the statutory maximum is life imprisonment. There can be only exceptional circumstances which could justify a term of imprisonment less than 3 years"".

	1.	In the above-mentioned case Shameem J has referred to Attorney General Reference (No. 1 of 1989) [90 Cr. App. R. 149] which laid down the guidelines for sentencing the offenders who had sexual intercourse with girls under 13 years. Like in Fiji, in England maximum sentence for such offence is life imprisonment and considering the guidelines Shameem J held;

""The court said that a wide range of sentences could be expected, but where the victim was not far short of her thirteenth birthday and there were no particularly adverse or favaourable features, at term of 6 years would be appropriate. The younger the girl when the sexual approach was first made, the more it would be that her will was overborne, and the more serious the crime"".

7. Aggravating factors in this case are that the age difference between the parties taking advantage of the complainant's vulnerability and lack of remorse by denying offence even in the mitigation stage. 
8. Mitigating factors are you are a young offender, married with a 06 month old child , sole bread winner and looking after your elderly mother .
9. Considering the facts in this case I select 06 years as my starting point and add 03 years for aggravating factors to reach 09years. For mitigating factors I deduct 03 years and for past good behavior I deduct 01 year to reach 05 years imprisonment. 
	1.	Considering your age as well as your past good behavior this Court would not impose non - parole period for you in this case. 

	2.	NIRAJ KIRAN PRASAD, you are sentenced to 05 years imprisonment for the offence of Defilement contrary to section 214(1) of the Crimes Decree. 

	3.	28 days to appeal

	1.	In a judgment delivered yesterday, the court found you guilty and convicted you on the following charges:

FIRST COUNT
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and Section 207(2)(b) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

ILAITIA MATASAVUI on the 14th day of September, 2011 at Lakena, Nausori in the Central Division, penetrated the vagina of V. V with his tongue without her consent.

SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and Section 207(2)(b) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

ILAITIA MATASAVUI on the 14th day of September 2011 at Lakena, Nausori in the Central Division, penetrated the vagina of V. V with his finger without her consent.

THIRD COUNT
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and Section 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

ILAITIA MATASAVUI on the 14th day of September 2011 at Lakena, Nausori in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of V. V without her consent.

	1.	The brief facts were as follows. You were well known to the complainant and her husband. You were neighbours at Lakena Hill, Nausori. At times, the complainant and her husband often invited you to their house, to share a meal. On 14th September, 2011, after midday, the complainant was gathering firewood at an island next to the Kings Road before Verata Vilage.

3. You were also in the area gathering firewood. You approached the complainant. You put a knife to her neck, forced her down on the ground and forcefully took off her clothes. You then unlawfully licked her vagina, poked her vagina with a finger and then inserted your penis into her vagina. She didn't consent to the above, and you well knew she was not consenting to the above, at the time.

4. The courts have repeatedly said that, rape, as a criminal offence, is always a serious offence. It is a serious unlawful intrusion into the privacy of someone. It is a betrayal of a person's dignity. Society looks down on these types of behaviour, and through their representative in Parliament, have prescribed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Through the years, the courts have set 7 to 15 years imprisonment as the tariff for the offence. see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal. The actual sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.

5. The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows:

(i) The complainant and her husband were your neighbours, and were friendly to you. They often invited you to their house, to share a meal with them. Prior to the incident, you were on friendly terms with them. However, by committing the offence of rape on the complainant, you betrayed the trust they had in you.

(ii) When committing this offence, you put a knife on the complainant's neck, and threatened to kill her if she resisted. This behaviour seriously aggravates the offence. Those who threaten women with a knife, and then rape them, must always expect a severe sentence. In other words, the more serious the threat, the higher the sentence will be.

(iii) When caution interviewed by the police on 21st September, 2011, you told the police that you don't know the reasons why the complainant reported the rape to police on 14th September, 2011. During the trial on 3rd April, 2013, you saw fit to defame the character of the complainant by saying that, the reason she reported the matter to police, was because you saw her having sex with her father. The assessors and the court rejected this view. Nevertherless, your utterance abovementioned revealed your depraved character, and a message ought to be given to you to stop belittling people.

(iv) Your offendings showed your utter disregard to the complainant's right to a peaceful life.
	1.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) Since the prosecution submitted no previous conviction, I will treat you as a first offender;

		(ii) You have been remanded in custody since your first appearance in the Nausori Magistrate Court on 19th September, 2011 to today, that is, approximately 1 year 6 months 14 days.

	2.	I will start with Count No. 3. I start with a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 15 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 3 years, leaving a balance of 12 years imprisonment. I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years.

	3.	I repeat the above process and sentence for Counts No. 1 and 2.

	4.	In summary, your sentence are as follows:
		(i) Count No. 1 : 12 years imprisonment.

		(ii) Count No. 2 : 12 years imprisonment.

		(iii) Count No. 3 : 12 years imprisonment.

	5.	Because of the principle of totality of sentence, I make the above sentence concurrent to each other. Your total sentence is 12 years imprisonment.

	6.	For raping the complainant, Ilaitia Matasavui, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.

	7.	The complainant's name is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

77740,"SENTENCE

1. On 27th February and 12th March 2012, in the presence of your counsel, you pleaded guilty to the following charge:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crime Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
P. M. on the 19th day of September 2011 at Newton in Nasinu in the Central Division, penetrated the vulva of K. L. T. with his finger without her consent.

SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crime Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
P. M. on the 19th day of September 2011 at Newton in Nasinu in the Central Division, indecently assaulted a girl namely K. L. T.

2. The prosecution read her summary of facts. Briefly, they were as follows. You are related to the 3 year old complainant. She was your niece, and you resided with her, in the same house. On the 19th September 2011, between 10 am and 11 am, you and the victim were at home. You walked up to the victim, pulled up her dress, lay on her vagina, and findle the same. You inserted your finger slightly into her vagina, and later licked her vagina, with your tongue. A relative interrupted you, and you fled the scene, when discovered. The matter was reported to police, and an investigation was carried out.

3. You were caution interviewed by police on 20th September 2011. You admitted the offences to the police. The child was medically examined on 19th September 2011, and the medical report said, ""...there was a tear at the 6 o'clock position at the vulva (outside vaginal opening), tear on either side of vaginal opening, hymen intact, and no bleeding or discharge...""

4. After the summary of facts were read, the court checked with your counsel to see that, all the elements of the two counts were admitted by you. On the first count, ie. rape, your counsel admitted on your behalf that, you penetrated the complainant's vagina, with your finger. The victim was under 13 years old, and therefore incapable of giving consent in law. You admitted, through your counsel that, you knew the child was incaple of giving her consent. On the second count ie. sexual assault, you admitted that, you licked the victim's vagina on 19th September 2011, knowing she was incaple of giving her consent, and that she did not give her consent. Given your admissions above, the court found you guilty as charged on the two counts. 

5. I have taken note of your written plea in mitigation, and your antecedent report. I note this is your first offending. I have read the victim impact report. I have read the sentence submissions, and all the papers submitted by the parties.

6. Rape is a serious offence. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment. For adults, the tariff is a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasin v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal.

7. Since the complainant in this case was a juvenile, that is, age 3 years old, the tariff for the rape of children is a sentence between 10 to 15 years: see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. HAC 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva.

8. ""Sexual Assaults"" carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. It is an aggravated from of indecent assault. The tariff has yet to be established.

9. This case involved a 16 year old juvenile preying on a 3 years old juvenile. A juvenile cannot be imprisoned for more than 2 years on any offence [section 30(3) of the Juvenile Act, chapter 56]. A juvenile can only be imprisoned, if two pre-condition are satisfied:

(i) the court certifies that he is so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in an approved institution; or

(ii) that he is so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained.
Of course, the sentence given, on any juvenile, will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors, in this case.

10. In this case, the mitigating factors are as follows:

(i) you are a juvenile, aged 16 years old;
(ii) this is your first offence;
(iii) you are educated to class 6 level;
(iv) come from a broken family;
(v) co-operated with police during the investigation;
(vi) you have been remanded in custody, at the Boys Centre, since 21st September 2011, ie. a period of approximately 8 months.

11. The aggravating factors are as follows:

(i) The 3 year female complainant is your niece. You are related to her, as an uncle. You were in a position of trust to her, at the age of 16 years. You breach the trust she had in you.

(ii) The rape of a child is always a serious offence, and the courts always takes a deem view of those who commit these type of offence. Children are the most vunerable in society, and the court must always act to protect them, whenever their rights are violated.

(iii) By sexually violating the 3 year old child, you showed utter disregard to her safety and well being, including her dignity.

12. I consider you a depraved character. For count No. 1, I start with a sentence of 12 months. For the aggravating factors, I add 4 months, making a total of 16 months. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the sentence by 4 months, leaving a balance of 12 months.

13. On count No. 1, I sentence you to 12 months imprisonment. On count No. 2, I sentence you to 6 months prison. Both sentences are concurrent to each other, ie. total sentence is 12 months prison.

14. However, since you have been remanded in custody since 21st September, 2011, that is, approximately 8 months ago, and given the standard 1/3 discount given to prisoners when sentenced by a Court of Law, I am of the view that you have already served your 12 months imprisonment, effective from 21st September 2011. I therefore discharge you. You are free to go home.

74009,"JUDGMENT

The Appellant was, on the 20th of April 2001, charged with the following offence:

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 154(1) of the of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

JONE BOA, on the 17th day of March 2001 at Lami in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a woman namely MERE DELAIVUNA.

He pleaded guilty but the trial commenced because he disputed the facts outlined by the prosecution. The prosecution called Mere Delaivuna, (the complainant) and two police officers. The evidence was that on 16th March 2001, the complainant, whose husband is a soldier and was away at Monasavu, was alone at home with her three children. She went to sleep at 8pm. Between 3am and 4am that night a person came into her bedroom and touched her vaginal area. She woke up and saw the Appellant in the light that was on in the sitting room. He ran away. She tried to switch on the light but could not. She then went to the main switch and found it had been turned off. She turned it on and followed the Appellant outside and saw him running away. She did not see his face but recognised him by his build. She said she knew the Appellant well because he visited the house regularly. The police witnesses tendered the Appellant’s police statements in which he had confessed to the offence. He had initially denied going to the complainant’s house that night, but when he was told that his father’s statement contradicted his, he changed his story. He said he had gone to the complainant’s house to see one Semesa, and saw the complainant lying there. He then touched her private parts. She got up and he ran outside. He said that he was the complainant’s first cousin.

The Appellant, when cross-examining the police witnesses suggested that they threatened him to make him confess. He gave sworn evidence saying that the police had failed to record everything he had said. Under cross-examination, he said the complainant’s evidence was untrue and that he had been forced by the police to give his statement. He said “the police officer who caution interviewed me didn’t punch me. The police charging officer didn’t punch me. I confessed because the police threatened me. They said they will lock me in the cell and punch me. I can’t remember the officer’s number. I had pain in the ribs. I didn’t seek medical examination. I didn’t report the matter to the police.”

He called a witness, Vika Rodgers, who said that she had been with the Appellant at 2am on 17th March 2001. She said she didn’t know where the Appellant was at 3am.

The learned Magistrate said that although the complainant’s evidence of identification was not reliable, he accepted the evidence of the confession. He found the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the Appellant and sentenced him to two years imprisonment.

The Appellant appeals against conviction and sentence on several grounds which I summarise for the sake of convenience:

1. The identification evidence was unreliable;

2. The victim had said that the Appellant was doing the same thing to other married women;

3. There was no corroboration;

4. There was evidence of an alibi which should have been accepted;

5. The Magistrate refused to hear witnesses;

6. The sentence of two years imprisonment was harsh and excessive.

At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant abandoned most of these grounds, and argued only that the evidence of identification was unreliable, and that he had been assaulted in police custody by the interviewing officer and that therefore the statements ought to have been excluded.

State counsel opposed the appeal. He conceded that the learned Magistrate ought to have dealt more thoroughly with the evidence relating to the admissibility of the confession, but said that there was ample evidence to justify conviction. He further submitted that the sentence was appropriate and fell within the tariff for indecent assault cases.

Identification

The learned Magistrate did not rely on the evidence of identification because he said the complainant had not seen the assailant’s face. Thus this ground of appeal lacks merit because the evidence was not relied upon.

Of course, it is arguable, that because the complainant was identifying a close relative, who was a regular visitor, recognition of his build might have been acceptable as safe identification evidence. However, an assessment of the quality of identification evidence is usually best left to the trial court on the basis of the length of the encounter, the lighting and the nature of the relationship between the witness and the accused. In this case the learned Magistrate assessed the evidence to be unreliable. The Appellant’s first ground of appeal is therefore based on a misapprehension of the basis of the judgment.

The Confession

The learned Magistrate directed himself generally about the burden and standard of proof, but did not do so specifically in respect of the admissibility of the confession. He said that he accepted the evidence of the two police officers who interviewed and charged the Appellant and rejected the evidence of the Appellant, which he said was contradictory in itself.

It is unfortunate that the learned trial Magistrate did not direct himself on the law relevant to the admissibility of confessions. In all cases, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that any confession made to a person in authority is voluntary, and not obtained by unfair means, or by oppression. However, if he had so directed himself, I doubt that the result would have been different. The Appellant said he was not assaulted, then, that he was. At the hearing of this appeal, he said he had been assaulted in the chest by the interviewing officer. At the trial, he alleged only threats, but then appeared to allege assault on the ribs. His evidence was clearly incredible and any reasonable tribunal would have rejected it. There were no credible grounds to challenge the admissibility of the confession. Thus, whilst the learned Magistrate erred in failing to refer to the test for admissibility, or to the burden of proof, I find that there was no miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal also fails.

Sentence

The sentence of 2 years imprisonment falls within the tariff for indecent assault cases in this country. In Ratu Veretariki Kadavu -v- State Crim. App. No. HAA 049 of 2000L, Prakash J after reviewing a number of indecent assault sentences, said that a custodial sentence of between 1 and 4 years is the tariff. In this case the Appellant assaulted a woman who trusted him as a relative, entered her home in the middle of the night as she lay asleep, and touched her vagina. The circumstances show a number of aggravating features and no mitigating ones.

In the circumstances I decline to reduce the sentence. This appeal is wholly dismissed.

Particulars of Offence (b)

SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2) (c) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

First Juvenile and Second Juvenile on the 10th day of October, 2010 at Nasilai Village, Nausori in the Eastern Division penetrated the mouth of R.E.R with their penises, without the consent of the said R.E.R.

02. When the plea was taken on 20/01/2011 both Juvenile pleaded not guilty to their respective charges. On 04/10/2012 counsel for the defense informed court that both Juvenile wants to re-consider their original plea. Accordingly information was read over again and after understanding the charges fully both Juvenile pleaded guilty to their respective charges. Accepting the Plea to be unequivocal this court found them guilty to their respective charges and convicted them under Section 207(1) and 207(2) (a) (b) of Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

03. State Counsel submitted following summary of facts of which both Juvenile admitted.

On Sunday the 10th day of October 2010 at about 08.00 hours R.E.R, 17 years old, Domestic Duties of Nasilai Village, Tailevu (hereinafter referred to as the complainant) was sitting at his grandmother's place when the two Juveniles, (hereinafter referred to as First and second) passed by and called the complainant to visit a vacant house at the edge of the village compound.

The two Juvenile then told the complainant to enter the vacant house, Juvenile 01 then told the complainant to remove his trousers, upon which the complainant obeyed. Juvenile 01 then threatened the complainant with assault if he tells anybody. Juvenile 01 then stood guard at the main door whilst Juvenile 02 forced the complainant to suck his penis. Juvenile 02 forced the complainant's head to his penis before he told the complainant to bend down upon which he penetrated his penis into the complainant's anus. The complainant was crying and tried to run away from the 02 Juvenile but Juvenile 01 grabbed hold of the complainant's body tightly.

Whilst Juvenile 02 was penetrating the complainant's anus, Juvenile 01 came and held the complainant's head down to suck his penis. The complainant turned away from the Juvenile but they forcefully grabbed him. The complainant was crying as he did not like what was being done to him. 

After the complainant suck Juvenile 01's penis, Juvenile 01 then proceeded to penetrate the complainant's anus with his penis. Whilst this was occurring, Juvenile 02 came in front of the complainant and forced him to suck his penis.

The Juveniles after the acts then told the complainant to wear his pants. The complainant was crying throughout and after the acts. The complainant went home and did not reveal the incident until his mother asked him. He then relayed the whole incident to his mother.

The two juvenile were then arrested, caution interviewed whereby Juvenile 01 admitted forcing the complainant to suck his penis and Juvenile 02 admitted to anal sex and penetration of the complainant's mouth.

Both Juveniles are first offenders. 

04. As per section 207(1) (2) (a) (c) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009 the maximum sentence for an offence of Rape is to imprisonment for life.

05. Section 30 of the Juvenile Act prescribes a maximum sentence of 2 years. As per section 20 Juvenile Act the words ""Conviction"" and ""Sentence ""shall not be used in relation to Juveniles.

Tariffs for Rape

06. In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:
""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent... the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must...reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

07. In the case of State v AT [2011] FJHC360: HAC 035.2011S (14th June 2011) Hon. Justice Temo remarked that; 

""In my view, order has to be established in the Juvenile world. Young persons who are approaching adulthood (i.e. 18 years old) should not be allowed to exploit the venerable in the Juvenile world. In this case, a 17 years 10 months and 03 days old juvenile takes the advantage of a 04 years old juvenile. In my view it is the duty of the court to step in and protect the most venerable in the Juvenile world.

This is especially so, when those who are approaching adulthood(i.e. 18 years old)take advantage of the young, by raping them. To commit rape against the young, in my view, is the characteristic of a ""depraved character"" and a custodial sentence within the ambit of the Juvenile Act is called for. The length of the sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors"". 

08. The First Juvenile is 18 years old and the Second Juvenile is 17 years old. Both are studying. 

09. In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person""

10. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

11. Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

12. The objectives of sentencing, as found in section 4(1) of the Decree, are as follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;

	2.	To protect the community from offenders;

	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;

	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or 

	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

13. Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a
Court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;

(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;

(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;

(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

14. Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	That the offence was committed on a Juvenile.
	2.	The offence was committed by two juveniles.
	3.	The victim was threatened with assault.
	4.	That the victim was forced to commit sexual acts by the two juveniles.
	5.	The victim was restrained by the two Juvenile.
	6.	The victim was emotionally traumatized as a result of the offence.

15. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances: 

	1.	Both are remorseful.
	2.	Both Juvenile saved the court time by pleading guilty to the charge.
	3.	Prevented the complainant from having to relive his ordeal encountered.
	4.	Both Juveniles are continuing their education.
	5.	Both are willing to offer traditional apology to the complainant's family. 
	6.	Both are first offenders and fully co-operated with police.

16. At present 1st Juvenile is 19 years and 05 months old and 2nd Juvenile is 17 years and 08 month old. The first Juvenile already approached adulthood. (i.e. 18 years old). The second Juvenile is approaching adulthood. (i.e. 18 years old). The profound duty of the court is to ensure safety and protection of Juveniles in the community. Hence this court is duty bound to pass an appropriate sentence in order to protect Juveniles from future offenders. The victim's impact report also taken in to consideration before passing the sentence. 

17. Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I sentence both Juveniles as follows:

	•	For the 1st count I take 12 months as the starting point. I add 04 months for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 16 months. I deduct 10 months for the mitigating factors.

	•	For the 2nd count I take 12 months imprisonment as the starting point. I add 04 months for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 16 months. I deduct 10 months for the mitigating factors.

18. I order both sentence to run concurrent to each other. Now the sentence of both Juvenile is 06 months imprisonment.

19. Considering personal background and other circumstances of this case I suspend the 06 months imprisonment of both Juvenile for a period of 02 years. Suspended sentence is explained to both Juvenile.

20. Probation officer is requested to arrange proper counseling programs for both Juvenile until they complete their education.

21. 30 days to appeal.

251317,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. The accused has been convicted in this Court after trial on one count of rape.
 
 
2. He has been found to have raped his 27 year old first cousin who for the purposes of this sentence we shall refer to as Donna (not her real name). 
 
 
3. Although 27 years, Donna has the mental age of a subteen and has great difficulty in coping with day to day life. She has relied on her mother since birth to guide and protect her. 
 
 
4. On the 12 March 2017, Donna’s mother went to town and left Donna in the care of the accused for a few hours. The accused was at the time staying temporarily in the family home.
 
 
5. Whilst alone, the accused took Donna into the bedroom, undressed her and raped her. When the mother returned she learned that something had occurred but Donna was too frightened to tell her the detail. All was revealed to an aunt about 10 days later and a report made to the Police.
 
 
6. The accused had said in evidence that Donna had insisted on sex and had raped him, a defence that wasn’t believed; neither by the assessors nor the Court.
 
 
The Accused
 
 
7. In mitigation for the accused Counsel told the court that he is now 20 years of age and works as a carpentry assistant to his father. He is a member of a large family with 7 siblings.
 
 
8. He is said to be remorseful (although the Court saw no evidence of such) and he asks for forgiveness. He has sought forgiveness from Donna’s family.
 
 
9. He is a practicing Christian and wishes to be free to bring his faith to others.
 
 
10. He is young and wishes to pursue a technical education at the Technical College in Labasa.
 
 
11. He has spent 4 months in remand awaiting trial and he has one previous conviction for indecent assault. 
 
 
The Tariff
 
 
12. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the sentencing range for rape of an adult is well settled to be between 7 to 15 years. (Marawa  [2004] FJHC 338 per Gates J. (as he then was) and Kasim C.App 14 of 1993 C.A. (unreported).
 
 
13. Rapes of children attract sentences of between 10 to 16 years (Raj CAV003 of 2014 (Supreme Court)).
 
 
This Sentence
 
 
14. This rape was the rape of a 27 year old who because of mental impairment acted and thought as a 10 year old would. That being so, it greatly aggravates the offence or alternatively removes the case from the adult range and places it into the child range. Rapes of children are regarded by the Courts as far more serious than rapes of adults in that children are not yet mature enough to cope emotionally with sexual violation, and if subject to such abuse their own progress to sexual maturity can well be jeopardized.
 
 
15. To rape a mental defective can have the same disastrous consequences and it for this reason that sentences should be passed in the range pari passu with the mental age of the victim. 
 
 
16. This crime therefore must be sentenced within the range of rapes of children; that is a sentence of between 10 to 16 years.
 
 
17. I take a starting point of 10 years. It is grossly aggravating that the accused should have breached the trust placed in him by his aunt to care for Donna whilst she was away. For that aggravation I add three years to the sentence. It is also an aggravating factor that the victim of the rape was mentally impaired, but as discussed earlier this aggravation is subsumed in sentencing the accused within the higher “child tariff”. 
 
 
18. The accused although young does not have the advantage of a clear record, he already having been convicted of a minor, but sexual offence in 2016. 
 
 
19. The court is not impressed with his mitigation of remorse and desire for forgiveness but his major mitigatory advantage is found in his very young age. He was 19 when committing the offence and 20 years of age at present. The courts have always been at pains to treat young offenders with mercy and to keep them from the baneful and corrupting influences of an adult prison community. Such good intentions however must be balanced with the seriousness of the offence he (or she) is convicted of. 
 
 
20. This offence is very serious indeed and the youth of the accused must be overshadowed by the gravity of his crime.
 
 
21. The only mitigating features that can assist this accused are his time spent in remand and his very young age. I deduct a generous 6 months to reflect the remand period served and so the sentence that the accused shall serve will be one of 12 years and 6 months.
 
 
22. I order that he serve a minimum term of 9 years before being eligible for parole. This lenient minimum term is not intended to distort the tariff for rapes of children but is a concession to this young and impetuous youth. 
 
 
23. I make a domestic violence restraining order against the accused as perpetrator and the victim as the protected person, an order to be in effect until further order of the Court.
 
 
Summary
 
 
24. Final sentence: 12 years 6 months
 Minimum term: 9 years

79318,"SENTENCE

[1] Following a trial, Elifasa Uili was convicted of indecent assault and Saila Asaeli was convicted of rape of the same victim. 

[2] The victim was 19 years old and lived in Kioa Island. The offenders are also from Kioa Island. The victim and the offenders grew up together in the same village in Kioa Island. The victim treated the offenders as her brothers. They visited each others homes and the victim and her parents trusted the offenders.

[3] On 17 July 2010 the victim joined the company of the offenders and a girl for a drinking party after a wedding ceremony in the village. After consuming substantial amount of liquor the victim passed out. While she was unconscious, the offenders sexually assaulted her.

[4] The first sexual assault was committed by Elifasa Uili. He kissed and sucked the victim's neck while she lay unconscious. She sustained visible contusions (love bites) on her neck.

[5] The second sexual assault was more serious. Saila Asaeli undressed the victim and raped her while she lay unconscious.

[6] Both assaults were witnessed by the girl who was in their company. She was threatened by Saila Asaeli when she caught him having sexual intercourse with the victim.

[7] The maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment. The case of Rokota v State Criminal Appeal HAA0068 of 2002 established the tariff for indecent assault to range from 12 months to 4 years imprisonment. Although Rokota's case was considered under the repealed Penal Code, the principles are applicable under the Crimes Decree, because the maximum penalty is the same.

In Rokota, Shameem J stated:

""The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect of the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence"".

[8] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for rape under the Crimes Decree is same as in the repealed Penal Code. In Kasim v State Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, the Court of Appeal established the starting point of 7 years imprisonment for the rape of an adult.

[9] Elifasa Uili was 26 years old at the time of the offending. He joined the police force in 2005 as a constable. In 2009 he was suspended from the police force for a disciplinary offence. He was never recalled to the force and the chances of him now being recalled is slim due to this conviction. Now he is 27 years old. He is single and unemployed.

[10] Saila Asaeli was 20 years old at the time of the offending. Now he is 21 years old. He is single and works as a salesperson at his sister's clothes shop.

[11] The only mitigating factor for Elifasa Uili is his previous good character.

[12] For Saila Asaeli the mitigating factors are his previous good character and young age.

[13] I give considerable weight to these mitigating factors.

[14] I take into account that the offenders spent one month in custody on remand. 

[15] The offending has aggravating features present. While no physical violence or weapon was used on the victim, the assaults took place while she was unconscious. The offenders took advantage of the victim's state of unconsciousness. She was not capable of resisting or defending herself. She was not aware of the assaults and would not have known about it, if not informed by the witness to the assaults.

[16] The victim trusted the offenders. The trust was build over years as they grew up together in the same village. The offenders breached that trust, having no regard whatsoever that the victim considered them as her brothers. In these circumstances, trust once breached cannot be re-gained. The offenders clearly exploited the victim as sex object when they found her unconscious. These are serious aggravating factors and the court must denounce any conduct that threat women as sex object. Any form of sexual assault on a woman is not only an attack on her body but is an attack on her soul. The perpetrators of sexual assaults on women must be deterred by punishment that reflects the gravity of the offence.

[17] For the offence of indecent assault, I pick 12 months as my starting point. I increase the sentence to 2 years to reflect the aggravating factors and reduce the sentence to 12 months imprisonment to reflect the mitigating factor and the remand period. 

[18] Elifasa Uili, I sentence you to 12 months imprisonment for indecent assault. There are no special circumstances to suspend the sentence.

[19] For the offence of rape, I pick 7 years as my starting point. I increase the sentence to 8 years to reflect the aggravating factors and reduce to 6 years to reflect the mitigating factors and the remand period.

[20] Saila Asaeli, I sentence you to 6 years imprisonment for rape with a non-parole period of 4 years.

255439,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] This is another case where a child was raped by a close relative. The offender is the cousin brother of the victim. The victim was raped when she went to her farm in Lekutu with her parents and siblings during the Christmas break in 2015. She was 12 years old and a primary school student at the material time. 
 
 
[2] The Accused lured the victim inside his house next to her farmhouse after exposing his private genitals to her when she went to wash dishes at a tap outside his house. When she entered the house, he performed oral sex on her and then had sexual intercourse with her. She did not report the incident to anyone until nine months later when she confided in her school teacher about what her cousin had done to her. 
 
 
[3] The seriousness of any offence is determined by the maximum penalty prescribed for it. For rape, it is life imprisonment. The tariff for rape of a child is 10-16 years’ imprisonment (Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2014)). 
 
 
[4] Rape of a child is so abhorrent that a condign punishment must be imposed to mark the community’s outrage against such crime. Sexual violence against children by their relatives is too prevalent in our society. Rape is the worst form sexual violence. The courts will continue to take a tough stance on offenders who rape children by imposing long prison sentences to denounce the crime and to give effect to the principle of deterrence for others. 
 
 
[5] In this case, there is very little evidence of remorse by the offender. There was evidence of a traditional apology made to the victim’s family in which the offender had cried, but the value of that apology diminished when the offender took the defence of alibi at the trial. What value an apology has when the offender later claims that he was not at the location of the crime at the material time and the allegation of rape against him was fabricated by the victim?
 
 
[6] When the offender committed the crime he was 18 years old. Now he is 21 years and married with a child. He supports his family and elderly parents by farming. He is a first time offender. The mitigating factors are the offender’s young age and previous good character. 
 
 
[7] The aggravating factors are:
 
  
• The offender is the victim’s cousin brother. As an adult male relative, he breached the victim and her family’s trust. 
 
 
• The victim was vulnerable due to her young age and her socio-economic background. She came from a rural community with little support to report sexual abuse due to cultural constraints. 
 
 
• The sexual abuse had a psychological toll on the victim. It took the victim nine months to confide and report to her school teacher. She cried when she relayed the abuse to her teacher. 
 

[8] After taking all these factors into account, the offender is sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment. The remand period is three months. The remaining term to be served is 10 years and 9 months imprisonment. Due to the offender’s youth at the time of the offence and his previous good character, the prospect of rehabilitation is high. I decline to fix a non-parole period.
