0,728,81142,"SENTENCE

""Reginal"" you appear for sentence in this Court, after pleading guilty to the offence of ""Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm"" Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

I am satisfied that your plea is ""unequivocal"" and that you understand the consequences of your plea.

""Reginal"" You are aged 30 and a father of three tender aged children. You are a resident of ""Kauata"" Street, Simla, Lautoka. The Complainant ""Anina Eva"" is your wife.

On the 03rd day of September 2011, around 9.30a.m. your wife started quarrelling and swearing at your father since he sought your permission to take one child to town for shopping. Being annoyed over your wife's swearing at your father, you punched her several times on her head and hand. As a result, she received bruises on her face and right hand.

The above mentioned summary of facts was read over to you by the Prosecution in open court. You admitted the summary of facts.

I see no aggravating factors in this case.

Mitigating Factors

1) You reconciled with the complainant.

2) The presence of the element of provocation.

3) You are remorseful for your actions and deeds.

4) You tendered an apology to Court.

The complainant in this case is your wife. She informed Court that she has forgiven you and has reconciled with you. This is a ""domestic violence"" offence. The Court cannot accept the reconciliation and dismiss the proceedings since there is a statutory prohibition contained in section 154 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Decree, 2009. But there is nothing to prevent Court from taking into account the reconciliation as a mitigating factor at the stage of sentencing.

According to section 275 of ""Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009"", the offence of ""Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm"" carries a maximum sentence of five (05) years imprisonment.

The tariff for ""Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"" varies from suspended sentence to 9 months imprisonment. (Per Gounder J in ""Jonetani Sereka vs State 2008 HAA 027/08S, 25 April 2008).

In ""State vs Anjula Devi"" Criminal Case No. 4 of 1998 Lab, it was held that the tariff for ""Assault Occasioninci Actual Bodily Harm"" ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault.

In ""Elizabeth Joseph vs State"" Criminal Appeal HAA 030 of 2004S, the accused stabbed her partner's wife with a pen knife. The victim received a cut on the finger. A sentence of 4 months imprisonment was upheld on Appeal.

In the case of ""State vs Tevita Alafi"" 2004 HAA 073/04S, it was held that it is the extent of the injury which determines the sentence.

In the case of ""Amasai Korovata vs The State"" F20061 HAA 115/06S it is in domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld.

Section 4[1] of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree limits the purpose of sentencing an offender to the following grounds:

(a) to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances;

(b) to protect the community from offenders;

(c) to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar natures;

(d) to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

(e) to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or

(f) any combination of these purposes.

Section 4[2] of the decree outlines what a sentencing Court must consider when sentencing an offender:

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence; (e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceeding at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(l) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option.

At this stage, I address my mind to the legal principles enunciated in the case of ""Divendra Bila vs State"" 43 FIR 144. In this case it was held ""each case must be assessed and evaluated in its true merits and that the best guidance as always is for the courts to grasp the essence of established general principles of sentencing and apply them based on the fundamental premise that a sentence should not be harsh and excessive or wrong in principle"".

""Reginal"" you pleaded guilty to the charge at the earliest opportunity. I note that your guilty plea has saved substantial time and money that could have been thrown away if you denied your involvement. To that extent, I note that your guilty plea operates in your favour.

It has been well recognized practice in common law to take into account a plea of guilty in the sentence. Most common Law Jurisdictions have codified this practice in sentencing statutes. In Fiji, the practice is a part of the common law.

In ""Navuniani Koroi v. The State"" Criminal Appeal No. AAU0037 of 2002S the court said:

""It has been the practice of the courts to reduce a sentence where the accused person has pleaded guilty. In most cases that is a recognition of his contribution as expressed by an early admission and the fact that it will save the witnesses and the court a great deal of time and expense. In offences of a sexual nature, the amount of reduction is generally more because the plea saves the victim from having to attend the trial and relieve her experience in the witness box"". 

The weight to be given to a guilty plea depends on a number of factors. Some of these factors were identified by Hunt CJ at CL in R v. Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 350:

""A plea of guilty is always a matter which must be taken into account when imposing sentence. The degree of leniency to be afforded will depend upon many different factors. The plea may in some cases be an indication of contribution, or of some other quality or attribute, which is regarded as relevant for sentencing purposes independently of the mere fact that the prisoner has pleaded guilty. The extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from the recognition of the inevitable: Shannon (1979) 21 SASR 442 AT 452; Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. The plea of guilty may also be taken into account as a factor in its own right independently of such contribution, as mitigation for the co-operation in saving the time and cost involved in a trial. Obviously enough, the extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon just when the plea of guilty was entered or indicated (and thus savings affected):Beavan (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Hunt, Badgery –Parker and Abadee JJ, 22 August 1991), at p.12. 

In the ""Principle of sentencing second edition, by D. A. Thomas, at P. 46 wrote

""The Final Step in the process of calculation the length of tariff sentence is to make allowance for mitigation, reducing the sentence from the level indication by the facts of the offence by an amount appropriate to reflect such mitigating factors as may be present. Mitigating factors exist in great variety, but some are more common and more effective than others.

They include such matters as the youth and previous of the offender.....""

I select Nine (09) months imprisonment as my ""starting point"". I reduce three (03) months for the ""Mitigating Factors"" and another three (03) months for the ""early guilty plea"". 

""Reginal"" you are a first offender. Hence I reduce one (01) month from your sentence, to mark your previous good behaviour.

Now, your sentence stands at two (02) months imprisonment.

""Reginal"" you pleaded for forgiveness and applied for leniency in sentencing as you have now learnt a lesson and you will not re-offend. You urged Court to consider your age, family commitments and your desire to get into the main stream of the society. You were forceful and potent in you Plea for a 'Non Custodial Sentence'.

In this context, I direct myself to consider the appropriate sentence on your conviction pursuant to your plea of guilty. In doing so, I am guided by the ""General Principles of Sentencing"".

Under Section 26 (2) (B) of Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, a sentence below two (02) years could be suspended.

A discussion of the process which should be undertaken when a judicial officer is considering a suspended sentence is found in the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v. Peterson [1994] 2 NZLR 533. There may be differences of details between the Fijian and New Zealand statutes. However, the principles stated in Petersen are helpful. These principles are summarized in the head note thus: 

""The principal purpose of [the relevant section] was to encourage rehabilitation and to provide the Courts with an effective means of achieving that end by holding a prison sentence over an offender's head. It was available in cases of moderately serous offending but where it was thought there was a sufficient opportunity for reform, and the need to deter others was not paramount. The legislature has given it teeth by providing that the length of sentence of imprisonment was fixed at the time the suspended sentence was imposed, that it was to correspond in length to the term that would have been imposed in the absence of power to suspend, and that the Court before whom the offender appeared on further conviction was to order the suspended sentence to take effect, unless of the opinion it would be unjust to do so. So, there was a presumption that upon further offending punishable by imprisonment the term previously fixed would have to be served (seep. 537 line 4).

The Court's first duty was to consider what would be the appropriate immediate custodial sentence, pass that and then consider whether there were grounds for suspending it. The Court must not pass a longer custodial sentence that it would otherwise do because it was suspended. Equally, it would be wrong for the Court to decide on the shorter sentence than appropriate in order to take advantage of the suspended sentence regime (seep. 538 line 47, p. 539 line 5). R V. Mah-Wingh (1986) 5 Cr App R (S) 347 followed.

The final question to be determined was whether immediate imprisonment was required or whether a suspended sentence could be given. If, at the previous stages of the inquiry, the Court had applied the correct approach, all factors relevant to the sentence were likely to have been taken into account already; the sentencer must either give double weight to some factors, or search for new ones which would justify suspension although irrelevant to the other issues already considered. Like most sentencing, what was required here was an application of commonsense judgment, in which the sentencer must stand off and decide whether the imposition of a suspended sentence would be consonant with the objectives of the new legislation (see p.539 line 8, p. 539 line 37).

Petersen's case was a prosecution appeal against leniency of sentence. Petersen had pleaded guilty at early opportunity, to reasonably serious drug offences: he was sentenced in the High Court to 18 months' imprisonment suspended for 2 years plus 9 months' periodic detention. He had no previous drug convictions and was aged 42 with family commitments. The New Zealand Court of Appeal considered Peterson's offending so serious that it quashed the suspended sentence and imposed one of 18 months' imprisonment concurrent on the several charges. The Court discussed at p. 539 the factors needing to be weighed in choosing immediate imprisonment or suspended sentence in these words:

""Thomas at pp.245-247 lists certain categories of cases with which suspended sentences have become associated, although not limited to them. We do not propose to repeat those in detail since broadly all can be analysed as relating either to the circumstances of the offender or alternatively the offending. In the former category may be the youth of the offender, although this does not mean the sentence is necessarily unsuitable for an older person. Another indicator may be a previous good record, or (notwithstanding the existence of a previous record, even one of some substance) a long period of free of criminal activity. The need for rehabilitation and the offender's likely response to the sentence must be considered. It is clear that the sentence is intended to have a strong deterrent effect upon the offender; if the latter is regarded as incapable of responding to a deterrent the sentence should not be imposed. As to the circumstances of the particular case, notwithstanding the gravity of the offence, as such there may be a diminished culpability, arising through lack of premeditation, the presence of provocation, or coercion by a co-offender. Cooperation with the authorities can be another relevant consideration. All the factors mentioned are by way of example only and are not intended as an exhaustive or even comprehensive list. The factors may overlap and more than one may be required to justify the suspension of the sentence in any particular case. Finally, any countervailing circumstances have to be considered. For example, in a particular case the sentence may be regarded as failing to protect the public adequately.

In concluding our consideration of the principles, we wish to add this. Understandably, the form of the legislation requires the sentencer to pass through a series of statutory gates, before reaching the point of availability of a suspended sentence. Subject to that however, like most sentencing what is required in the end is an application of commonsense judgment, in which the sentencer must stand off and decide whether the imposition of a suspended sentence would be consonant with the objectives of the new legislation. In many instances an initial broad look of this kind will eliminate the possibility of a suspended sentence as an appropriate response"".

D. A Thomas in ""Current Developments in Sentencing"" (1969) Crim. L.R. 237 said.

""The court has refused to order suspension of a sentence passed for what amounted to a series of offences rather that an isolated one; in cases where the offence exhibits a degree of careful premeditation, or where the offence amounts to a serious breach of trust. The court is also reluctant to order suspension where the length of the term imprisonment already makes substantial allowance for the factors which are urged as a basis for suspension.

In O' Keefe (1969 1 ALL ER 426, the English Court of Appeal noted that 

""The court must go through the process of eliminating other possible courses such as absolute discharge, conditional discharge, probation order, fines and then say to itself: this is a case for imprisonment required, or can I give a suspended sentence?""

In Fiji, concern has repeatedly been expressed by the courts about the over-use of the suspended sentence. Byrne J in Nand Kumar –v- The State Crim App. No. HAA0115.2002L said - 

""In line with other judges I have frequently expressed the view that suspended sentences generally are a snare and a delusion in that they tend to give a person convicted a false sense of security and leave him under the mistaken belief that he has not done any wrong because he has not been sent to prison.

Grant C.J. said in DPP –v- Jolame Pita 20 FLR 5:

""Once a court has reached the decision that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted there must be special circumstances to justify a suspension, such as an offender of comparatively good character who is not considered suitable for, or in need of, probation, and who commits a relatively isolated offence of a moderately serious nature, but not involving violence. Or there may be other cogent reasons such as the extreme youth or age of the offender, or the circumstances of the offence""

The Court ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders. ""The first offenders should not be sentenced to immediate imprisonment"" (Moses Nariva –v- State, Criminal App, HAA 148/2005).

""Reginal"" since you are clearly remorseful, you must be given an opportunity to prove your remorse by embarking on a period of good behaviour.

In the circumstances, I decided to suspend your sentence.

""Reginal"" I sentence you for two (02) months imprisonment. The operation of the term of imprisonment is suspended for two (02) years. [The purpose and the effect of the suspended term is explained to the accused along with the consequences of the breach under section 26 (3) of Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009].

If an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment is committed within the operational period of the suspended term, the suspended term shall begin to run in addition to the sentence that you may get for the subsequent offence.

The accused is also informed that the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment during the operation of the suspended sentence is an offence itself against section 28 of the Sentencing Decree for which he could be arraigned and punished by the Court.

Assault causing actual bodily harm is listed as a domestic violence offence in Schedule 1A of the Decree.

Section 24 (a) (b) (i) of the Decree provides:

(a) Subject to subsection (3) but not withstanding any other provision in this Decree - 

(b) where a person – 

(i) pleads guilty to, or is found guilty of, an offence which is a domestic violence offence;

(ii) the Court must make a domestic violence restraining order under this Decree for the safety and well being of the person against whom the offence or alleged offence was committed;

(iii) where subsection (1) applies the Court need not make an order under this section if satisfied that, having regard to the safety and wellbeing of the person for whose protection the order would be made, the order is not required.

Section 24 (1)(b)(i) is a mandatory provision. The only discretion given to the Court is when the safety and wellbeing of the victim is a non-issue. In this case, since the accused is convicted of a domestic violence offence and the safety and wellbeing of the victims are an issue, the Court has no discretion but to issue a restraining order against the accused in addition to the sentence.

I issue a restraining order for the safety and wellbeing of the victims; 

➢ NON MOLESTATION 

In accordance with section 27 of the Decree, the following standard non-molestation conditions apply to this Order: The terms of the order are that the accused must not:

• Physically assault the victim.

• Threaten to physically assault the victim.

• Damage or threaten to damage any property of the victim.

• Threaten, intimidate, or harass the victim.

• Behave in an abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards the victim.

• Encourage any person to engage in abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards the victim.

28 days to Appeal.

FOURTH COUNT
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
HIND MUNISHWAR LAL on the 5th day of March 2014 at Labasa in the Northern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of S. A. C. without her consent.
 
 
2. The brief facts were as follows. You were 25 years old and the complainant was 18 years old on 18 February 2014. The complainant was a first year student at Fiji National University, while you had been a student there for 5 years. You enticed her to your flat at Labasa, on the pretext of giving her some FNU papers and textbook. When she was in your flat, you forced yourself on her and raped her. You then would not allow her to return home, unless you took her naked pictures.
 
 
3. She was under duress when you took her naked pictures via your mobile phone camera. Your later sent her home, but warned her to come and have sex with you in future, as and when you pleased, otherwise you will put her naked pictures in Facebook. She was stunned and helpless. You phoned her on three occasions (i.e. 24 February, 4 and 5 March 2014) to come and see you; otherwise you will implement your threats. She came to you and you raped her on those occasions.
 
 
4. ""Rape"", as a criminal offence, had always been viewed seriously by the lawmakers of this country. It is a serious violation of a person's dignity. It demeans a person and is the worst form of sexual assault. Consequently, it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Previous case laws had set the tariff for the rape of an adult a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v State, Criminal Appeal Case No. 14 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Marawa, Criminal Case HAC 016 of 2003, High Court and State v Lepani Veimusu, Criminal Case No. HAC 257 of 2010, High Court. The actual sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.
 
 
5. In this case, the aggravating factors were as follows:
 
 
 (i) Trickery and Personal Deceit. You tricked and deceived the complainant, in order to have sex with her, without her consent. You knew she was a first year Fiji National University (FNU) student in February 2014, and you knew she was vulnerable. You had been studying at the FNU for the previous 5 years. You tricked her into your flat to give her ""some papers and textbook"". You knew she was a private student and needed help. You had no papers and textbook. When she arrived in your flat, you attacked her and raped her. Then you cunningly took her naked pictures via your mobile phone camera. You then threatened her to come to you for sex in the future; otherwise you will put her naked pictures in Facebook. On 3 occasions, you called her. Under duress, she submitted to your threat. You raped her three more times. Your behaviour was utterly despicable, and you must not complain when your liberty is taken away to pay for what you did to the complainant.
 
 (ii) When you offended against the complainant, you showed no regards for her human rights and dignity. You had no regards for her right to live in peace. In fact, you have ruined her education, because she is now not at FNU.
 

6. As for the mitigating factor, I can only find one, that is, you had been remanded in custody from 10 March 2014 to 28 October 2014, when you were imprisoned (7 months 18 days). Then, when released in April 2015, you were remanded in custody until today (4 months). So, in total, you were remanded in custody for approximately 11½ months.
 
 
7. On count no.1, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 15 years imprisonment. For time already served while remanded in custody, I deduct 1 year, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment.
 
 
8. I repeat the above process and sentence for count no.2, 3 and 4.
 
 
9. The summary of your sentences are as follows:
 
 
(i) Count No.1 – Rape : 14 years imprisonment.
 
(ii) Count No.2 – Rape : 14 years imprisonment.
 
(iii) Count No.3 – Rape : 14 years imprisonment.
 
(iv) Count No.4 – Rape : 14 years imprisonment.
 
 
10. Because of the principle of totality of sentencing, I direct that all the above sentences are to be made concurrent to each other, that is, a final sentence of 14 years imprisonment.
 
 
11. Mr. Hind Munishwar Lal, for raping the complainant on four different occasions in February and March 2014, at Labasa in the Northern Division, I sentence you to 14 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years imprisonment, effective forthwith. 12. The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.
 
 
13. The accused's mobile phone (Prosecution Exhibit No.1) and the USB (Prosecution Exhibit No.2) are to be destroyed by the Court Registry once the appeal period to the superior courts expires. This is done to protect the privacy of the complainant.

_______________________________________________________________________
 
  
• The Accused is found guilty and convicted for three counts of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and two counts of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 
 
 
• It was proved at the conclusion of the hearing that you, being the father of the victim, came to her while she was sleeping on the 29th of March 2014. You then forcefully had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. The victim was 19 years old at that time. Before you had sexual intercourse, you indecently and unlawfully kissed her cheek and neck. On the 13th of April 2014, you again came to her while she was lying in the bed. You then unlawfully and indecently kissed her lips. After that, you forcefully had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. You again forcefully had sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent on the 16th of April 2014. The victim is your biological daughter. She has been growing up with her mother as you have divorced her mother, when she was few months old. The victim came to see you on the 29th of March 2014 after a long separation of nineteen years. 
 
 
• This is a case of incestuous father, using his daughter for his sexual gratification. Many cultures have developed laws, rules and norms, prohibiting sexual relationship between closely related persons. Incestuous relationship of parent and children has condemned and deprecated by many societies. Accordingly, it appears that a father, using his own daughter as surrogated sexual partner is not only against the acceptable social norms and values, but also the acceptable human behaviours. 
 
 
•  Parents are the trusted and dependable persons that a person normally has in their lives. Turning that trusted dependable person into a monstrous demon who penetrated in to the innocent life of his own child and destroy it with his own lustful sexual satisfaction, would undoubtedly warrant a deterrence punishment in sentencing. Incest is a rape by extortion, in which the victim’s relationship with the perpetrator becomes a weapon used to control her. 
 
 
• Having considered the serious nature of this offence, I now turn my attention to consider the purpose of this sentence. The main purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence. It is a responsibility of the court to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature and protect the community from offenders of this nature. A harsh and long custodial sentence is inevitable for the offences of this nature in order to demonstrate the gravity of the offences and also reflect that the civilized society denounce such crimes without any reservation.
 
 
• The tariff for the offence of rape involving an adult victim ranges from seven (7) years to fifteen (15) years of imprisonment period. 
 
 
• Justice Madigan in State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca - Sentence [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC252.2011 (14 November 2012) has expounded the tariff for the offence of Sexual Assault as between 2 years to 8 years’ imprisonment, where his Lordship held that: 
 

 “The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment. It is a reasonably new offence, created in February 2010 and no tariffs have been set, but this Court did say in Abdul Kaiyum HAC 160 of 2010 that the range of sentences should be between two to eight years. The top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus. The bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks.
 
 A very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the United Kingdom's Legal Guidelines for Sentencing. Those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories:
 
 
 Category 1 (the most serious)
 
 Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim.
 
 
 Category 2
  
• Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
 
• Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
• Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 

Category 3
 
Contact between part of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia)”
 
  
• The victim impact report states that this crime has adversely affected the victim emotionally and psychologically. Hence, I find the level of harm caused to the victim is substantially high. 
 
 
• You have unleashed these disgraceful sexual exploitations on the victim when she was not in a position to seek any assistance or find a way to escape. She was in your house which is located in a remote forest area away from the village. You knew that she could not go back, even to the nearest village, by her own as it takes few more hours to go on foot through the forest. You manipulatively committed these crimes in the night when she was getting ready to sleep. Hence, it appears that you found an opportunity, where the victim was vulnerable without any prospects of escaping, in order to satisfy your heinous and lustful sexual gratification. You have threatened the victim saying that you will kill her if she tells anyone about this incident. In respect of the second incident of Rape, you have grabbed her hand and pulled her down to the floor when she refused to oblige to your sexual demand. Hence, I find the decree of culpability in these offending is substantially high. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this crime, and the level of harm and culpability, I select ten (10) years as the starting point for each count of Rape and two (2) years for each count of Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• You have blatantly breached the trust reposed in you by the victim as her Father. By committing this crime on the victim, you denied the natural growth of her life. Being the biological father of the victim, it was your duty and responsibility to provide the victim necessary protection and care with love and affection, specially when she came to see you after long separation of nineteen years. By committing this crime, you have ignored to fulfill such duties and responsibilities. The age different between you and the victim was about 26 years at the time of this crime took place. I consider these factors as aggravating circumstance of this crime. 
 
• The learned counsel for the defence submitted in mitigation about your family circumstances. You are divorced and have two children. However, the family background of the offenders of this nature has very minimal mitigatory value. 
 
 
• You are a first offender. Therefore, it is appropriate to give you some substantial discount for your previous good character. Beside of your previous good character, I do not find any mitigating factor in your favour. 
 
 
• In view of the above discussed aggravating circumstances, I increased four (4) years to reach interim imprisonment of fourteen (14) years for each count of rape and six (6) years interim imprisonment for each count of Sexual Assault. I reduce one (1) year for you previous unblemished character. Your final sentence has now reached to thirteen (13) years of imprisonment for each count of Rape and five (5) years of imprisonment for each count of Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• Having considered your age and opportunities for rehabilitation, I find eleven (11) years of non-parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence. Hence, you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eleven (11) years pursuant to Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 

Head Sentence 
  
• Accordingly, I sentence you for a period of thirteen (13) years imprisonment for each count of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act as charged under first, third and fifth counts in the information. Furthermore, I sentence you for a period of five (5) years imprisonment for each count of Sexual Assault contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act as charged under second and fourth counts in the information. 
 
 
• All of these sentences to be served concurrently. I further order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eleven (11) years. 
 

Actual Period of Sentence 
  
• You have been in remand custody for this case for a period of one (1) year and two (2) months as you were not granted bail by the court. In pursuant of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider the period of one (1) year and two (2) months as a period of imprisonment that have already been served by you. 
 
 
• Accordingly your actual sentencing period is eleven (11) years and ten (10) months of imprisonment period, with nine (9) year and ten (10) months of non-parole period. 
 
 
• Since this incident involves with domestic violence, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the Domestic Violence Act. I accordingly make a permanent domestic violence restraining order against the accused with standard non-molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to sections 24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Act. The above domestic violence restraining order will be in force until this court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it. Furthermore, if you breached this restraining order, you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of section 77 of the Domestic Violence Act. 
 
 
• Thirty (30) days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

• SETAREKI MOULONGO, you were found guilty by this Court after a trial for 3 counts of Rape contrary to Section 149 & 150 of the Penal Code Cap 17 and 4th count of Attempted Rape contrary to Section 151 of the Penal Code Cap 17. 
 
 
• It was revealed during the trial that between the 01st day of January 2004 and the 31st day of December 2004 at Taveuni in the Northern Division, you raped XY (name suppressed). At that time she was 08 years old . Again in 2007 on two different occasions you raped her when she was only 11 years old . Also in the same year you attempted to rape KN ( name suppressed) who was 08 years old. 
 
 
• Both parties have filed their respective submissions in this case and I have considered them also for my sentence. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for the offence of Rape under the Penal Code is life imprisonment. 
 
 
• In Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 it was stated :
 

“We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage” 
 
  
• The tariff for the rape of children is from 10- 16 years imprisonment. In Raj v State [2014] FJCA 18; AAU0038.2010 (5.3.2014) the Fiji Court of Appeal held that Rape of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years and this was confirmed by the Supreme Court. 
 
 
• In State v Mario Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 his Lordship Justice Madigan held that:""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""
 
 
• For attempted Rape the prescribed penalty is 10 years imprisonment and tariff is from 12 months to 05 years imprisonment. (Aunima v The State)[2001]FJHC 105.
 
 
• As the accused was a juvenile at the time of the offences section 30 of the Juvenile Act is also relevant and therefore the maximum prison sentence can be imposed on him is 02 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Aggravating factors in this case are the age of the victims, vulnerability of them and the breach of trust as you were an uncle of both victims and they were under your care when some of these offences were committed . 
 
 
• Mitigating factors are young age, first offender and seeks forgiveness from this Court. 
 
 
• For each count I select 12 months as my starting point ( this is below the tariff for rape but considering the accused was a juvenile this is justified) and add 10 months for aggravating factors to reach 22 months imprisonment. For the mitigating factors I deduct 06 months and as the final calculation I deduct the period in remand ( 01 month) to reach 15 months imprisonment for each count. Considering the totality principle these are concurrent. 
 
 
• Final issue to be decided in this whether I should suspend this sentence. Both parties have submitted number of case laws regarding that issue. From these I would agree with the observation made by his Lordship Justice Temo in State V AT [2011] FJHC 344 where the Lordship said ""In my view, order has to be established in the juvenile world. Young persons who are approaching adulthood (ie. 18 years old) should not be allowed to exploit the vulnerable in the juvenile world. In this case, a 17 years 10 months 3 days old juvenile takes advantage of a 4 year old juvenile. In my view it is the duty of the court to step in and protect the most vulnerable in the juvenile world. This is especially so, when those who are approaching adulthood (ie. 18 years old), take advantage of the young, by raping them. To commit rape against the young, in my view, is the characteristic of a ""depraved character"", and a custodial sentence within the ambit of the Juvenile Act is called for""
 
 
• Further I would like to add that a deterrence sentence is warranted when there is an abuse the trust and the victims are children to prevent these from occurring in future. Accordingly you SETAREKI MOULONGO are sentenced to 15 months imprisonment for these offences. 
 
 
• For the safety of the victims (XY and KN) I also issue a permanent DVRO with standard non molestation conditions in favor of them. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal

4,732,81599,"SENTENCE

1. Jone Waqalevu, you were charged with the following offence:

Statement of Offence

Act With Intent to Cause Grievous Harm: contrary to section 255(a) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

Jone Waqalevu, on 22nd day of January 2012 at Silimaibau place, Howell Road in the Central Division with intent to do grievous harm to Ilisapeci Soko unlawfully wounded the said Ilisapeci Soko with a knife. 

2. The High Court of Fiji extended its jurisdiction to this Court pursuant to section 4(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 to determine this matter.

3. On 25.06.2012 you informed on willingness to change your early plea of 'Not Guilty' which was entered on 27.02.2012.

4. On the following day you pleaded guilty before this Court. The Court is satisfied that your plea is free from any influence. Thus you are convicted as charged. 

5. Following facts are established in the Summery of Facts presented by the prosecution. The victim of this case has been your wife. She shared thirty years of marital relationship with you. She was 50 years old and brought-up five children. At the time of the incident she lived in the same compound with you in Howell road.

6. Both you and the victim were not in talking terms for about three weeks prior to the incident. You occupied a room down stairs alone.

7. The incident occurred at around 4 am. You walked in to her room and woke up to ask if she has any other relationship with another. She refused to talk to you. But you kept on insisting her to answer whether she loves you. 

8. Thereafter you asked your son who was sleeping with the victim to vacate the room. When your son went out from the room, the victim too tried to follow him to the daughter's room. You went after her and asked again the reason behind getting a restraining order against him. She did not answer your series of questions.

9. You went down stairs to bring a kitchen knife from the washing sink which was outside the house. You hid it inside the laundry basket upstairs and approached the victim to ask again. She did not reply. When you tried to get the knife the victim came behind appealing to forgive her. You brought the knife out.

10. Having seen the weapon she tried to escape but the attempt failed. You struck her from back. You assaulted in front of her niece. Somehow she fled out to the neighbours to call the police.

11. When the police arrived at the scene the victim found lying beside the back door of the house with bleeding injuries. The injuries were tied up to prevent further bleeding. It appears that this was done by you. Later she was admitted to CWM hospital to undergo a series of emergency operations. Her life was survived due the intensive medical attention.

12. You were later arrested by the police and you have admitted the offence in your interview under caution. You further mentioned that you were tired of being to Court with her since 2011.

13. You admitted above summery of facts. 

14. The state has produced the medical report of the victim as a part of the Summery of Facts. However the Court called for a further report from the medical officer as the initial medical report was incomplete. Dr. Leone Vadeni, Orthopaedic Registrar for the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon of CWM hospital forwarded a letter dated 06.07.2012 which gives clarity to the earlier report.

15. According to the medical report she was admitted to the hospital with multiple injuries to arms, face and scalp. She has suffered with,

a. Multiple open fractures to both forearms;

b. Multiple open fractures to various fingers;

c. Open fractures to her skull;

d. Multiple blunt traumas to face and various parts of body.

16. She has undergone a series of surgical operations to clean and close open wounds as well as internal fixation for some of her fractures. She has received inpatient treatments for a half a month at CWM. Further she has reported dizziness on standing up during her follow-up clinics.

17. Section 255(a) of the Crimes Decree 2009 states that any person who is with intent to cause grievous harm, unlawfully wounds or does grievous harm to anyone by whatever means is guilty for the offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

18. The maximum sentence of the offence indicates the seriousness of the offence for which the accused has been found guilty now.

Tariff for the Offence

19. Hon. Justice Shameem in State v Annamallay [2005] FJHC; HAC 004 of 2004 held that the tariff sentence ranges from suspended sentence where there are no or minimal injuries and where the parties have resolved their differences to 2½ years imprisonment where there was serious injury and the use of weapon was involved.

In State v Viliame Cavubati  [2002] FJHC; HAA 080 of 2001S the Court observed that:

'An offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is a serious one which must almost always result in an immediate custodial sentence....The cases brought to my attention seem to bear that proposition out however given that the maximum term of imprisonment is life imprisonment, this ""range"" would now appear in 2010 to be rather lenient. By using such a lethal weapon, this offence should only ever attract a suspended sentence in the rarest, circumstances and sentences of up to 4 or 5 years could easily be justified.

20. In State v. Tuigulagula (2011) FJHC 163 Hon. Justice Madigan considered that the prolonged attack of several blows on the victim was an aggravating factor. In this case the accused had been the husband of the victim. The starting point for the sentence of this case was five years. The court saw fit to sentence him to 6 years imprisonment and fixed a parole of four years.

21. In determining the appropriate starting point of the sentence, this Court has considered the need for deterrence against persons who may be similarly inclined to commit this offence. 

22. I have also considered the apparent ease with which accused persons seem to think that taking the law into their own hands is the way to settle their grievances.

23. Having considered the judgement of State v. Tuigulagua I take 4 ½ years imprisonment as the starting point for this offence. 

Aggravating Factors

24. The aggravating features of the offence are,

i. The victim had been the wife of the accused. She was 50 years old. The victim was vulnerable as she was with another female relative at the time of the incident;

ii. It appears that there was no provocation on the part of the victim, she has only remained silent during the questioning of the accused;

iii. You have used a knife to assault the victim. You in fact went downstairs to bring it from outside sink;

iv. Multiple open fractures and other injuries indicate that you have assaulted her many times.

25. I increase your the sentence by another 3 ½ years to reflect above aggravating factors. Now the sentence stands at 8 years imprisonment.

Mitigating Factors

26. Full allowance must be given for your progressive approach towards the matter to save Court's time. A discount of 24 months is given for your early plea. 

27. This will leave the sentence at 6 years imprisonment.

28. Your counsel filed extensive submissions on mitigation. You are 54 year old; sole provider of the family; co-operated with the police investigations; and you are now remorseful for what happened. I deduct further period of 6 months for your above personal circumstances. In this instance the sentence arrives at 5 years and 6 months imprisonment.

29. Furthermore, pursuant to section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I reduce another 6 months for the period that you were held in remand prior to this sentence.

30. Now your sentence stands at 5 years.

31. Your previous record of violent behaviour does not afford any credit to you. Out of 3 previous convictions you have been convicted once for the offence of ""Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"". I am of the view that an offender of your nature cannot expect any mercy from the Court.

32. Jone Waqalevu, today you are sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for the offence of ""Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm"". You will serve two years of that term before being eligible for parole.

33. Further the Court issues a permanent domestic violence restraining order on you with standard non molestation conditions as per section 24(1)(b)(1) of the Domestic Violence Decree 2009 to ensure the wellbeing of the victim Ilisapeci Soko. 

34. Since this Court exercising the extended jurisdiction of the High Court, you may appeal against this sentence within 30 days with leave of the Court of Appeal. 

Pronounced in open Court,

5,733,72470,"SENTENCE

1. You, Tota Naidu are to be sentenced upon being convicted to the charge of indecent assault contrary to section 176 of the Penal Code.

2. The maximum punishment for this offence is imprisonment for 7 years.

3. It was revealed during the trial that on the 24th August 2008 you put your penis into the mouth of a 2 year of child. You took the child into your house while he was playing with his siblings and attempted to satisfy your despicable sexual desires. The sister of the child saw the incident through a glass door and reported it to her grandmother. Later the matter was reported to the police. It appears that you were about 47 years old at the time of the incident. You were living in the adjoining house of the victim.

4. I have observed the following aggravating factors in this case;

a) the victim is a 2 year old boy.

b) you were about 47 years old. 

c) you breached the trust being a very close neighbour.

d) you took the advantage of your position as an elder in the neighbourhood.

e) This appears to be a premeditated and a well planned offence. 

5. In mitigation your Counsel informed Court that;

""you are 50 years old. Married with 3 children. Earns 60 dollars a week. No previous convictions. A binding order may be issued for good behaviour for the next 12 months.""

6. I do not see that you are remorseful of your actions. It should be noted that this is not a case where a binding order would be sufficient as far as the gravity of the offence is concerned. The court has a duty to impose severe punishments for this kind of offences as this kind of actions should be categorically denounced in a civilized society. This is not a case only against morality but it violates the fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as well. Unfortunately you were charged for indecent assault as there is no proper offence to charge you under the old Penal Code for the real offence you committed.

7. It has been the case in most of the instances that young children are molested by offenders who are known to them rather than by unknown persons. Parents leave their children with known persons with the firm belief that their children would be safe. But you have breached that trust being an elder of the immediate neighbourhood. I cannot imagine a more pervert and heinous crime than this, committed on a 2 year old vulnerable child who can not even tell his mother what happened to him. If the sister of the child had not seen this, the child would have been in more danger due to your pervert actions. 

8. The sentencing and penalties decree sets out the following purposes of sentencing;

a. to punish offenders to an extent and in manner which is just in all the circumstances

b. to protect the community from offenders

c. to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature

d. to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated

e. to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences

9. In this case I pick my starting point as 2 years. For the aggravating circumstances I enhance the sentence by 12 months. I do not find any mitigatory circumstances in this case. Therefore I arrive at a sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

10. You are a first offender. Yet I do not think that the circumstances of this case warrant this court to impose a non custodial sentence on you having taken into account, the nature of this offence. Besides Justice Priyantha Nawana stated in State v. Vilikesa Tilalevu and Savenaca Mataki HAC 081 OF 2010;

""I might add that the imposition of suspended terms on first offenders would infect the society with a situation - which I propose to invent as 'First Offender Syndrome' - where people would tempt to commit serious offences once in life under the firm belief that they would not get imprisonment in custody as they are first offenders. The resultant position is that the society is pervaded with crimes. Court must unreservedly guard itself against such a phenomenon, which is a near certainty if suspended terms are imposed on first offenders as a rule.""

11. Thus I impose a 3 years imprisonment on you. To reflect the abhorrence of the Court and the society for this kind of paedophilic actions, I order that you are not eligible to be considered for parole for two years and 6 months.

28 days to appeal.

6,734,70480,"SENTENCE

1. On 20th April, 2012, in the presence of your counsel, you pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, in the following information:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

MURDER: contrary to Section 237(a)(b)(c) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

SEREMAIA NAIDOLE MOMO on the 13th day of March 2011 at Kasavu, Nausori in the Central Division, murdered TONY BARLEY.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

MURDER: contrary to Section 237(a)(b)(c) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence 

SEREMAIA NAIDOLE MOMO on the 13th day of March 2011 at Kasavu, Nausori in the Central Division, murdered MERE MARIA NAVUE.

2. The matter was then adjourned to 4th May, 2012 to enable the prosecution to prepare the summary of facts, and other documents. On 4th May, 2012, the prosecutor read her summary of facts in court. 

3. The facts were briefly as follows. The accused was 27 years old on 13th March 2011. The deceaseds, Tony Barley and Mere Navue, were aged 22 years, at the time. The accused worked as a caretaker at Vuniwavudi Settlement, in Logani, Tailevu. Both deceaseds were, at the time, occupying a farm house, at Balabala Settlement, Kasavu. The accused had been drinking liquor with friends since Saturday, the 12th March 2011 until 4 am on 13th March, 2011 - a Sunday. He walked towards his home, along Kings Road, after 4 am, and met the two deceaseds, along the way. According to the accused, Tony swore at him. The accused continued on his way for about 40 to 50 meters, and then stopped. He suddenly felt slighted by Tony's swear words, and thought it appropriate for Tony to be taught a lesson. He returned, but found the deceaseds have gone to the nearby farm house.

4. He went to the farm house, carrying a tree branch. He heard the deceaseds talking inside. He forced open the door, and saw them lying on a wooden bed inside the house. Tony stood up. The accused threw two punches at him, and he fell and sat on the bed. The accused then took a spade lying beside the wall, and swung it at Tony. The sharp edge of the spade struck the right rear side of Tony's head, causing severe head, skull and brain injuries. The accused struck Tony with the sharp edge of the spade 2 or 3 times. Mere shouted when she saw what the accused was doing. The accused then swung the sharp edge of the spade at the left side of her face, causing severe head, skull and brain injuries. The accused then picked up the tree branch and repeatedly hit Tony with it. Tony, despite been seriously injured, was still breathing. The accused then throttle him, until he died.

5. The accused then picked up the tree branch, and struck Mere's face twice. Mere was still breathing, despite been seriously injured. The accused then took off his clothes to his knees, and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her, while she was unconscious. After ejaculating inside her, he took off her bra and strangled her with it. But she was still breathing. He again forced himself on her by having sex with her. Then he stood on her throat for about 15 minutes until she was dead.

6. After the summary of facts were read, the court checked with defence counsel, to see that all the ingredients of ""murder"" were admitted by the accused. Mr. J. Savou, on behalf of his client, admitted that, the accused hit the deceaseds' heads with the sharp edge of a spade (engages in conduct), which caused serious head and brain injuries to them, leading to their deaths (conduct causes the death of another person), and at the time, the accused intended to cause their deaths. The court was satisfied, on the basis of counsel's admission, on behalf of his client, that the accused was guilty of murdering the two deceaseds, at the material time. The court then convicted the accused as charged.

7. I note you admitted your five previous convictions of ""Criminal Trespass"" (2003); ""Shop Breaking Entering and Larceny"" (2004); ""Larceny"" (2006); ""Unlawful use of a punt"" (2006); and ""Assault causing actual bodily harm"" (2011). I have noted your antecedent report. I have also noted the victims' impact report. I have taken into account your written and verbal plea in mitigation, including all the written and verbal submissions, submitted by you and the prosecution.

8. ""Murder"" is a serious offence, and it is often said, to be at the top of the criminal calender. It carries a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment. (Section 237, Crime Decree 2009). The court has the power to fix a non-parole period to be served, before a prisoner is eligible for parole. Case precedents show that the non-parole period for murder varies widely, depending on the peculiar facts of the case. In Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji, on 5 counts of murder and 1 of attempted murder, the accused was given 19 years non–parole period on each murder count, and 10 years consecutive on a pending prison sentence, total non-parole period was 26 years. In State v Niume & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 010 of 2010, High Court, Suva, on 2 counts of murder, Accused No. 1 was given 25 years non-parole period for the murder counts. In State v Ashwin Chand, Criminal Case No. HAC 032 of 2005, High Court, Lautoka, on a count of murder, the accused was given a non-parole period of 22 years. In State v Navau Lebobo, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2002, High Court, Suva, the non-parole period was 20 years. Twenty years non-parole period were also imposed in the following three cases: State v Anesh Ram, Criminal Case No. HAC 124 of 2008S, High Court, Suva; State v Bharat Lal & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 061 of 2009S, High Court, Suva, and The State v Salesi Balekivuya, Criminal Case No. 095 of 2010S, High Court, Suva. In State v Tukana, Criminal Case No. HAC 021 of 2009, High Court, Lautoka, the non-parole period was 11 years. The non-parole period imposed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

9. The mitigating factors, in this case, were as follows:

(i) You pleaded guilty to the two murder charges, and therefore saved the court's time, although this was 1 year 19 days after first call in the High Court;

(ii) You have been remanded in custody since you first appeared in the Nausori Magistrate Court on 16th March 2011. You have therefore being in custody for 1 year 2 months and 2 days;

(iii) You co-operated with the police during their investigation, by admitting the offences, when caution interviewed on 13th, 14th and 15th March 2011; 

(iv) You appear remorseful by pleading guilty to the offences.

10. The aggravating factors, were as follows:

(i) You have unnecessarily terminated the life of two young people, who were both aged 22 years old, at the time of their death;

(ii) You had no justifiable reason whatsoever to take the lives of these two, and your excuse that Tony swore at you, and that you needed to teach him a lesson, was no excuse whatsoever;

(iii) Your method of killing the two showed your utter disregard for human life. You got hold of a spade, and using its sharp edges, you literally ""crack opened"" their skull, causing fatal head and brain injuries, when you struck their heads with the same;

(iv) After severely injuring the two, as described above, you proceeded to repeatedly strike Tony with a tree branch, and then struck Mere also with the same;

(v) After the above, you throttle Tony to death;

(vi) Then you proceed to rape Mere twice while she was severely injured and unconscious;

(vii) Then you strangled Mere with her bra, and stood on her throat, for about 15 minutes, until she died;

(viii) For what you did to the two deceaseds, you must accept that your liberty would be withdrawn, to atone for your deeds.

11. On count No. 1, I sentence you to mandatory life imprisonment. For the non-parole period, I start with 20 years imprisonment. I increase it by 8 years to 28 years for the aggravating factors. I decrease it by 4 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 24 years. You are to serve a non-parole period of 24 years imprisonment.

12. On count No. 2, I repeat the above process and sentence.

13. In summary, on each count, you are sentenced to life imprisonment. On each count, you are to serve a non-parole period of 24 years each. Given the principle of the totality of sentences, both sentences are concurrent to each other, ie. you are sentenced to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 24 years imprisonment. I order so accordingly.

• MOHAMMED FAIYUM, you were charged with one count of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Crimes Act No 44 of 2009.
 
• You pleaded not guilty wherefore this was fixed for hearing on 13th September 2017. But on that day you through your counsel informed that you wanted to change your plea and pleaded guilty for this charge. 
 
• You also admitted the following summary of facts presented by the prosecution : 

On the 3rd of July, 2011 at about 1800hrs, Ms.ED (A-1), 14 yrs, student of Naiviteitei, Bureta reported at the station that one MOHAMMED FAIYUN (B-1), 26yrs, mechanic for Standard Conrete residing at Mulomulo Cemetry road, Nadi indecently assaulted (A-1) by touching her breast inside a ten wheeler truck somewhere between Navuloa and Naiviteitei, Bureta village.
 
On the above mention date, time and place, (A-1) with one of her cousin plan to walk back to Bureta after the monthly church service for the circuit of Bureta which was held at Navuloa village. On their way back, they met the ten wheeler truck than accused stopped for them. (A-1) hopped into the truck whereby her cousin sat in front with the driver than (A-1) sat behind the driver’s seat with (B-1). On the way, then (B-1) asked (A-1) if he can touch her. (A-1) replied by saying “NO’. (A-1) got a shock when she felt (B-1)’s hand touching her breast. (PW-1) pushed (B-1)’s hand away but (B-1) kept on touching her breast. Again (B-1) than asked (PW-1) if he can kiss her. (PW-1) replied by telling (B-1) that she do not know how to do it. (B-1) than pulled (A-1)’s face to him than forcefully kissed (A-1) on her mouth. Accused kept on doing this until they reached Bureta.
 
Upon report received at the Station PC 4503 Vonevate (C-1) was appointed the Investigating Officer. Enquiry was made by (C-1), than information received that accused is back at this place in Mulomulo. On 14/5/13, then (C-1) arrested (B-1), interview him under caution whereby he denied the allegation, formerly charged to appear in custody at Nausori Magistrate Court today 16/5/13.
  
• I am satisfied that you plea was voluntarily and unequivocal. Accordingly I convict you for this offence. 
 
• The maximum penalty Indecent Assault under the Crimes Act is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
• The tariff was discussed in RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S where her Ladyship Justice Shameem held :

""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type""
  
• In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State ( Criminal Appeal AAU 0018 of 2010) his Lordship Justice Goundar discussed the guiding principles for determining the starting point in sentencing and observed : 

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range"".
  
• Considering the above judicial precedents and based on an objective seriousness of the offence, I select 16 months as the starting point for your sentence. 
 
• At the time of offending the victim was 14 years old. Further at that time you were 26 years old making significant age difference between the parties. I consider these as aggravating factors and add 10 months to reach 26 months imprisonment. 
 
• In mitigation the learned counsel for the accused submitted the following grounds:  
• Married with 2 children;
 
• Reconciled ;
 
• First offender;
 
• Remorseful. 

 
• In Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014) his Lordship Chief Justice Anthony Gates held that in Rape cases little weight can be given for personal mitigating factors of an accused. 
 
• In my view this applies to other sexual offences also. Further this is not an offence that can be reconciled under the Criminal Procedure Act. But I give substantial weight to your good behavior and deduct 04 months to reach 22 months imprisonment. 
 
• You did not plead guilty at the first available opportunity. Hence in my view you are not entitle for 1/3 deduction that would be given for the early guilty plea. But there need to be some credit for saving the victim even at the last minute from giving evidence in court and subject to cross-examination. For this I deduct 04 months to reach 18 months imprisonment. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend your sentence as requested by your counsel in her mitigation submission. 
 
• MOHAMMED FAIYUM, the victim who was 14 years old got in to your truck trusting you and the driver to drop her in home. But you exploited her vulnerability by subjecting her to your lust. You touched her breasts and forcefully kissed her till the vehicle reached the destination. You were aware that the victim was helpless to resist your advances in the truck and used that to your advantage. Your behavior need to be denounced with a custodial sentence even though this may bring some misery to your young children. 
 
• Accordingly I sentenced you to 18 months imprisonment for this charge. 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

8,736,82128,"JUDGMENT

Background

[1] The appellant appeared in the Magistrates’ Court at Nasinu on a charge of assault occasioning bodily harm, contrary to section 245 of the Penal Code. After waiving his right to legal representation, the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. He appeals against the conviction and sentence on the following grounds:

(a) THAT the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in convicting the Appellant without promoting any reconciliation, as required under section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code, despite the fact the Appellant informed the Learned Trial Magistrate that he had reconciled with the Complainant.

(b) THAT the sentence imposed by the Learned Trial Magistrate is harsh, excessive and wrong in principle.
Consideration of Grounds

[2] Section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides:

In the case of any charge or charges brought under any of the provisions of subsection (1) of section 197 or of section 244 
or of section 245 or of subsection (1) of section 324 of the Penal Code, the Court may, in such cases which are substantially of a
person or private nature... and which are not aggravated in degree, promote reconciliation and encourage and facilitate the settlement
in an amicable way of the proceedings, on terms of payment of compensation or on other terms approved by the Court, and may thereupon order the proceedings to be stayed or terminated.

[3] The decision to promote or not to promote reconciliation is discretionary. In an appeal against exercise of discretion, the appellant has to demonstrate that the learned Magistrate:

[a] made an error of principle, or
[b] failed to take into account all relevant matters, or
[c] took into account irrelevant matters, or
[d] was plainly wrong.

[4] The appellant was charged with a reconcilable offence. The complainant was his wife. The offence arose from a domestic dispute when the appellant after unsuccessfully searching for an employment arrived home and was questioned by the complainant. The appellant lost his temper and slapped the complainant on her right cheek and right ear. Medical examination revealed tenderness on the complainant’s ear and some other parts of the body. The injuries were not serious.

[5] When the appellant mitigated on his behalf after pleading guilty, he informed the learned Magistrate that he had reconciled with his wife and that he would be going to Labasa to bring her back to their home in Suva. The learned Magistrate then adjourned the proceedings to the 9th of October, 2007 for sentencing.

[6] On the 9th of October, 2007 the learned Magistrate after identifying the mitigating and aggravating factors set out below, sentenced the appellant to 3 months imprisonment:

Mitigating Factors
[a] Pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity.
[b] Young Offender.
[c] First Offender.
[d] Has reconciled with the complainant.
[e] Unemployed.

Aggravating Factors
[a.] Assaulted his wife for no good reason.
[b.] This is not the first time he has assaulted his wife.
Repeat Offender Re: Assault.
[c.] Doctor in the Medical Report suggested the accused may be on drugs (marijuana).
[d.] Medical Report sustained injuries to the ear, right knee, area, back and backside.

[7] Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Magistrate not only failed to consider reconciliation, but took into accounts extraneous matters in sentencing such as the previous assault and drug use by the accused.

[8] I accept that the learned Magistrate should not have taken the drug use and the previous assault as matters of aggravation. These matters were contained in the medical report of the complainant. Apparently, these matters were relayed to the doctor by the complainant and were hearsay evidence. An accused should be punished on the basis of the charged offence and admitted facts. The appellant did not admit to the previous assault and to the drug use, and therefore these matters should not have been used as matters of aggravation to punish the appellant (see, Vakalalabure v The State Criminal Appeal No. CAV0003 of 2004S). 

[9] There is no doubt that the circumstances of the offending were private in nature. The purpose of reconciliation in a domestic case is not to condone the abuse of a wife by the husband but to preserve their relationship according to their wishes. However, before acceding to the wishes of the parties, the court must ensure that no undue pressure was placed on the wife to reconcile because of the weak bargaining power that women have in society and in the family (see, State v Manu Chandra [2005] HAA 005/05S).

[10] Bearing in mind the mitigating factors such as the plea of guilt, the age and previous good character of the accused, and the minor injuries sustained by the complainant, the learned Magistrate should have afforded the accused an opportunity to have his wife made available in court to confirm the accused’s assertion that he had reconciled with her. Since the appellant was unrepresented, the obligation was on the learned Magistrate to encourage and facilitate reconciliation in an amicable way. 

[11] The learned Magistrate’s failure to discharge her judicial function properly prevented her from doing justice to the appellant according to law (see, Davendra Bijay v State [1997] 43 FLR 144). The appellant served three days in prison before he was granted bail. Spending three days in prison is a form of punishment for a first time young offender. The complainant confirmed to this Court that she has reconciled with the appellant and they are living together. I am satisfied that she has willingly reconciled with her husband to preserve their marriage. 

[12] Both grounds of appeal succeed.

Result

[13] Appeal allowed. Conviction is quashed and sentence is set aside. 

[14] The proceedings against the appellant are terminated under section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

",1,1,1,1,3,judgment,963
9,737,270256,"SENTENCE
 
___________________________________________________________________________
  
• The name of the Complainant is suppressed.
 
 
• You are found guilty and convicted by this court for four counts of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1), (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and one count of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a), which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment.
 
 
• It was proved at the conclusion of the hearing that you penetrated the vagina of the Complainant with your tongue on three different occasions on the 17th of March, 24th of March and 13th of April 2017. On the 24th of March 2017, you have unlawfully and indecently rubbed your penis on the anus of the Complainant. It was further proved that you have penetrated the vagina of the Complainant with your finger on the 13th of April 2017. The Complainant was twelve years old at the time of these incidents took place. She is your step-daughter. 
 
 
• This is a case of sexually exploitation of a young child by a close and elderly family member within her own family environment. Young children are the most vulnerable victims of sexual assault of this nature. Such sexual exploitation of children by the family member has become a social menace in this country, which requires a more constructive and affective intervention of the law enforcement authorities, including the Court of Law. Therefore, I find this offending is a very serious crime. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this offence, it is my opinion that such offenders must be dealt with severe and harsh punishment. Hence, the purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence and protection of community. Moreover, the Court must demonstrate in sentencing that the offenders of this nature are socially abhorrent. 
 
 
• Hon. Chief Justice Gates in Anand Abhay Raj [2014] FJSC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2014) held that the tariff for rape of a child is between 10 - 16 years’ imprisonment period.
 
 
• Justice Madigan in State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca - Sentence [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC252.2011 (14 November 2012) has expounded that the tariff for the offence of Sexual Assault as between 2 years to 8 years’ imprisonment, where his Lordship held that: 
 

 “The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment. It is a reasonably new offence, created in February 2010 and no tariffs have been set, but this Court did say in Abdul Kaiyum HAC 160 of 2010 that the range of sentences should be between two to eight years. The top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus. The bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks.
 
 A very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the United Kingdom's Legal Guidelines for Sentencing. Those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories:
 
 
Category 1 (the most serious)
  
• Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim.
 

Category 2
  
• Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
 
• Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
• Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 

Category 3
  
• Contact between part of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia)”.
 
 
• The victim was twelve years old at that time. Undoubtedly, a crime of this nature adversely affects the child both psychologically and socially. Because of this incident, the Complainant had to move away from her family and the village. She now lives with her grandparents. Hence, I find the level of harm is substantially high in this crime.
 
 
• You have committed these series of shameful crimes on the Complainant when she was alone at home. You found the opportunity when she was alone with no prospect of resist or escape, in order to unleash your venom sexual gratification on her. You then threatened her that you will do something to her, if she tells anyone about these incidents. I accordingly find the decree of culpability in this offending is substantially high.
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this crime, and the level of harm and culpability, I select twelve (12) years as the starting point for each of the four counts of Rape and two (2) years for the count of Sexual Assault. 
 
• You have blatantly breached the trust reposed in you by the Complainant as her step-father. The age difference between you and the Complainant was substantially high at the time of this crime took place. By committing this crime, you have denied the Complainant, her natural growth in life. I consider these factors as aggravating circumstances of this crime. 
 
 
• You are a first offender. Therefore, you are entitled for a substantive discount for your previous good behaviours pursuant to Section 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 
 
• The learned Counsel for the defence submitted in your mitigation about your personal and family circumstances. However, such family and personal mitigations have very minimal mitigatory value. Accordingly, I do not find any mitigating factor in your favour apart from your previous good behaviours. 
 
 
• In view of the above discussed aggravating circumstances, I increased three (3) years to reach interim imprisonment of fifteen (15) years for each of the four counts of rape and five (5) years for the Sexual Assault. I reduce one (1) year for your previous good character. Your final sentence for each of the four counts of Rape has now reached to fourteen (14) years of imprisonment. The final sentence for the sexual assault has reached to four (4) years of imprisonment. 
 
 
• Having considered the seriousness of this crime, the purpose of this sentence, your age and opportunities for rehabilitation, I find twelve (12) years of non-parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence. Hence, you are not eligible for any parole for a period of twelve (12) years pursuant to Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 

Head Sentence
 
  
• Accordingly, I sentence you for a period of fourteen (14) years imprisonment for each of the four counts of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act and for a period of four (4) years imprisonment for the offence of Sexual Assault contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act. All these sentences to be served concurrently. Further, I order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of twelve (12) years pursuant to Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 

Actual Period of The Sentence
 
  
• You have been in remand custody for this case for a period of four (4) months and nine (09) days as you were not granted bail by the Court. In pursuant of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider the period of five (5) months as a period of imprisonment that have already been served by you.
 
 
• Accordingly, the actual sentencing period is thirteen (13) years and seven (7) months imprisonment with non-parole period of eleven (11) years and seven (7) months. 
 
 
• Since this incident involves with domestic violence, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the Domestic Violence Act. I accordingly make a permanent domestic violence restraining order against you with standard non-molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to section 24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Act. The above domestic violence restraining order will be in force until this Court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it. Furthermore, if you breached this restraining order, you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of section 77 of the Domestic Violence Act. 
 
 
• Thirty (30) days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

10,738,79449,"JUDGMENT

[1] The appellant was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment in the Magistrates' Court at Savusavu. He filed an appeal against sentence. When he appeared for hearing, he applied for leave to withdraw his appeal saying he is about to be released from prison.

[2] The grounds of appeal alleged that the Magistrates' Court failed to consider the following factors:

i) Reconciliation with the victim.
ii) Previous good character. 
iii) Early guilty plea.
iv) Mitigation.

[3] The victim is the spouse of the appellant. At the time of the offending the appellant was employed as a chef in a resort. On the day in question the victim approached the appellant at his work while he was drinking beer with his workmates. While they were arguing, a female companion of the appellant joined in the argument. The appellant and his female companion punched the victim several times. The victim sustained lumps, bruises, laceration and swellings over her head and face.

[4] The maximum penalty prescribed for assault causing actual bodily harm is 5 years imprisonment.

[5] In his sentencing remarks the learned Magistrate took into account the appellant's early guilty plea, remorse and previous good character as mitigating factors. As for aggravating factors the learned Magistrate took into account the assault arose from a domestic dispute. The victim was physically injured and alcohol was involved.

[6] The learned Magistrate gave no weight to reconciliation because the victim informed the court that the appellant had previously assaulted her. 

[7] The learned Magistrate correctly pointed out that the offence arose from a domestic relationship and therefore was not reconcilable. This, however, does not mean that reconciliation could not be taken into account in sentencing the offender. 

[8] Under the repealed Criminal Procedure Code the court was obliged to encourage reconciliation in cases of domestic violence. If the parties reconciled the court had an option of terminating or staying the proceeding without imposing any punishment on the offender. 

[9] The Domestic Violence Decree has changed the old law. Under the new law, domestic violence offences are not reconcilable and therefore there is no discretion given to the courts to encourage reconciliation. However, if the victim freely reconciles with her partner and gives evidence of that effect, reconciliation is a factor that ought to be taken into account in sentencing the offender.

[10] In the present case, there was no evidence of reconciliation and therefore the learned Magistrate was not obliged to consider it. The term of 6 months imprisonment was within the tariff and was arrived at after all relevant factors were taken into account. 

[11] No error of law or fact has been shown in the sentence of the appellant. Leave to withdraw appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

[12] My concern is that the appellant was convicted of a domestic violence offence and neither the prosecution nor the learned Magistrate considered the provisions of the Domestic Violence Decree to grant relief to the victim. 

[13] The Domestic Violence Decree binds the State (s.3). There is a legal obligation on the police (s.12), the prosecutors (s.16) and the judicial officers (s.17) to implement the provisions of the Decree in domestic violence cases.

[14] Assault causing actual bodily harm is listed as a domestic violence offence in Schedule 1A of the Decree.

[15] Section 24 (1)(b)(i) of the Decree provides:

Subject to subsection (3) but notwithstanding any other provision in this Decree-

(b) where a person –

(i) pleads guilty to, or is found guilty of, an offence which is a domestic violence offence; 

the Court must make a domestic violence restraining order under this Decree for the safety and wellbeing of the person against whom the offence or alleged offence was committed;

(3) Where subsection (1) applies the Court need not make an order under this section if satisfied that, having regard to the safety and wellbeing of the person for whose protection the order would be made, the order is not required. 

[16] Section 24(1)(b)(i) is a mandatory provision. The only discretion given to the court is when the safety and wellbeing of the victim is a non-issue. In my judgment, since the appellant was convicted of a domestic violence offence and the safety and wellbeing of the victim was an issue, the learned Magistrate had no discretion but to issue a restraining order against the appellant in addition to the prison sentence.

[17] Under its appellate jurisdiction, the High Court can make any order that could have been made by the Magistrates' Court.

[18] For the reasons given, I issue a restraining order for the safety and wellbeing of the victim. The terms of the order are that the appellant must not:

(a) physically assault his spouse.

(b) threaten to physically assault his spouse.

(c) damage or threaten to damage any property of his spouse.

(d) behave in an abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards his spouse.

(e) encourage any person to engage in abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards his spouse.

[19] The appellant is warned that breach of the restraining order is a criminal offence under the Domestic Violence Decree.

[20] Any application for variation, suspension or discharge of this restraining order is to be filed and heard in the High Court at Labasa.

[21] I direct the Clerk of the Court to make available a copy of this order to the victim, the appellant, and the Commissioner of Police for police records, without delay.

[Name of the victim is suppressed. The victim will be referred to as S.L.]
 
 
1. SudeshAnand Kishore, you stand convicted of two counts of rape. 1st count contrary to Sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap 17 and 2nd count contrary to Sections 207 (1) and (2) (a) (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
2. The victim 'SL' was adopted by Bimla Wati when 'SL' was one day old. You were living with Bimla Wati as her de-facto partner and the victim 'SL'also was staying with you and Bimla. Therefore, the victim 'SL' was under the care and custody of Bimla and you. You raped 'SL' on several occasions during the years 2010 and 2011.
 
 
3. The victim 'SL' was 9 years old when you raped her. 
 
 
4. The maximum punishment for Rape is imprisonment for life. The tariff for rape is now settled in Fiji. It is 10-16 years of imprisonment. (Raj-v-State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003.2014 (20 August 2014).
 
 
 In case of State-v-AV[2009] HAC 192.2008 (21 Feb 2009) Justice Goundar said;
 
 
""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault ......Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children ............... Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.""
 
 
5. Medical report of the victim is filed of record with the victim impact statement. The doctor who examined the victim has said in her report that the child was showing some signs of psychological withdrawal. You have raped her over a long period of time. This will surely scare her for the rest of her life.
 
 
6. On both counts 1 and 2, without taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors, I take 12 years as the starting point. 
 
 
7. The aggravating factors are that this is a serious breach of trust, as the victim 'SL' was under your care and custody. You were the de-facto partner of her adoptive mother Bimla. The victim would have expected you to look after her, instead you raped her. The impact on the victim that is mentioned in the medical report also considered.
 
 
8. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors and now your interim sentence is 17 years.
 
 
9. I consider the mitigating factors submitted on behalf of you. You are a first offender and your previous good behavior is considered. I also consider that you are 30 years old and that you are a father of 2 children. Your personal circumstances are also considered. You have shown no remorse and therefore, you will not get a discount for that. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors. I deduct a further 1 year for your period in remand in this case.
 
 
 Now your final sentence on each count is 13 years imprisonment. I order that the sentences in counts 1 and 2 to run concurrently.
 
 
 Your non parole period will be 12 years.

• DAVENDRA DHANUK SINGH , you were convicted after a trial to one count of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. 
 
 
• It was proved beyond reasonable doubt that on 07th January 2011 in MHCC you Indecently Assaulted Ms. KN (name suppressed) by touching her private part. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for this offence under the Crimes Decree is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In Ratu Penioni Rokota v State Criminal Appeal No.HAA 0068 of 2002 her Ladyship Justice Shameem held that: 
 

""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type""
 
  
• In Koroivuki v. State[2013] FJCA 15; AAU 0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Suresh Chandra said:
 

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.""
 
  
• Considering the gravity of offending I select 02 years as the starting point in this sentence. 
 

Aggravating Factors 
 
  
• I consider following as aggravating factors:
  
• The victim is your biological daughter and you were supposed to look after her. Even though you were separated from your wife at that time you still had a duty to look after her and protect her. By committing this offence you have breached that trust. 
 
 
• The victim was 03 years old at that time and there was big age difference between the parties. 
 
 
• This also falls in to the category of domestic violence offence. 
 

 
• For these aggravating factors I add 02 years to reach 04 years imprisonment. 
 

Mitigating Factors 
 
  
• In the mitigation submission filed by your previous solicitors following were submitted as mitigating factors. 
  
• 30 years old;
 
• First offender;
 
• Working as an advisory counselor;
 
• Co-operated with the police;
 
• Looking after the financial welfare of the daughter. 
 

 
• You have denied this offence in your caution statement and also forced your daughter to give evidence in the Court. Therefore I do not think that you have co-operated with the police. Also there is no evidence to show that you are looking after the welfare of your daughter. Therefore I disregard these as mitigating factors. 
 
 
• You have called following people as character witnesses. 
  
• Semi .S.Kuru (Provincial Administrator –Tailevu) 
 
• Dabar Singh (father) 
 
• Nemeli ( employee) 
 
• Peter Tarusiva( Boxing coach) 
 
• Raving Singh ( cousin/teacher) 
 

 
• These witnesses described you as a role model in the society, good employer, and caring son and asked for leniency from this Court. For these mitigating factors and for your past good behavior I deduct 01 year to reach 03 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• It has been said that the daughter is always a princess to her father. She would look to her father for protection even when she is grown up. But you have breached the trust and subjected her to this ordeal in her tender age. Even though I do not have victim impact report in her evidence the victim said she was having night mares after this incident. 
 
 
• Therefore your behavior has to be denounced in the strongest manner and also a message need to be given to the society that sexual violence against children would not be condoned by the court. 
 
 
• I sentenced you to 03 years imprisonment for the offence of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree with a non-parole period of 02 years. 
 
 
• For the safety of the victim I also grant a permanent DVRO with standard non-molestation order .
 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

• MOSESE MASESE , you were convicted after a hearing to one count of Sexual Assault contrary to section 210(1) (a) of the Crimes Act No.44 of 2009.
 
• The victim, Ms.NR in this case is presently 08 years old and from Naqara Village, Naitasiri. When this incident happened in 2015 she was 06 years old and was playing when you called her to an empty house. There you removed her panty and touched her vagina twice. You also asked whether she would prepare to have sexual intercourse with you which she was not aware. Then you let the victim go and later she reported this matter to grandmother. These facts were proved during the hearing. 
 
• The maximum penalty for this offence under the Crimes Act is 10 years imprisonment. Tariff is 02 to 08 years imprisonment. 
 
• In State v. Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252.2011 (14 November 2012), his Lordship Justice Madigan referring to the United Kingdom's Legal guidelines for Sentencing categorized sexual assault  into 3 categories.

Category 1 (the most serious)
 
Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim.
 
Category 2
 
(i) Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
(ii) Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
(iii) Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 
Category 3
 
Contact between parts of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia).
 
 5. You touched the vagina of the victim and therefore this falls to category 02. In State v Naua - Sentence [2015] FJHC 105; HAC162.2013 Justice Madigan held that this category attracts 05 to 06 years imprisonment. 
6. In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013) the Court of Appeal discussed the guiding principles for determining the starting point in sentencing and observed : 
""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. 
7. Considering the above judicial precedents and based on an objective seriousness of the offence, I select 05 years as the starting point for your sentence. 
8. The victim was 06 years old at the time of offending. You were 62 years old putting significant age difference between the parties. You are related to the victim and she is calling you uncle. Hence by committing this offence you breached the trust of the victim. I consider these as aggravating factors and add 04 years to reach 09 years imprisonment. 
9. In mitigating your counsel submitted the following: 
a. You are presently 64 years old;
b. Married with 04 children;
c. You are suffering from some illnesses; 
  
• In Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014) his Lordship Chief Justice Anthony Gates held that in Rape cases little weight can be given for personal mitigating factors of an accused. I find this is valid for other grave sexual offences also and find the above personal mitigating factors would not be relevant for your sentence. 
 
•  Your counsel further asked this court not to consider against you for proceeding to trial. Even though you allowed the victim to come to court and giving evidence about this sexual incident, article 14 (2) (l) of the 2013 Constitution said the accused has right to call witnesses, present evidence and challenge evidence against him. Hence in my view you have exercised your right under the Constitution. Accordingly I agree with your counsel submission about this issue. 
 
• As I noted earlier your personal mitigating factors are not valid grounds to consider in this sentence. But the prosecution confirmed that you have no previous convictions and for that I deduct 01 year to reach 08 years imprisonment. 
 
• You were in remand for nearly 01 month and presently remanded for sentence (3 days) and pursuant to section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider that as period of imprisonment you have already served. This means your finial sentence is 07 years 11 months imprisonment. 
 
• In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State( supra) the Court of Appeal further held that if the final sentence falls above or below the accepted tariff , the sentencing court has to give reason for that. As mentioned earlier the tariff for this category is 05 to 06 years imprisonment. But due to serious aggravating factors present in this case and lack of mitigating factors have allowed me to give this final sentence which is above the accepted range even though in the end it is within the overall tariff. 

 15. I would like to conclude my sentence with the following remarks. Sexual assaults upon young children in this country by close family members must be severely punished. The perpetrators engage in these despicable conducts must serve long prison sentences, not only to punish them, but also to deter others who might have similar inclinations. Only through these kinds of harsh sentences these offences can be stopped and children can be protected. 
16. MOSESE MASESE, accordingly you are sentenced to 7 years and 11 months imprisonment for this charge with a non-parole period of 05 years. 
  
• 28 days to appeal

14,742,74658,"SENTENCE
Act with intent to cause grievous harm

	1.	On the 11th April 2014 in this Court, the accused entered a plea of guilty to the following count:

Statement of Offence
ACT WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 255 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
JOSUA DRELINAVAI on the 3rd January, 2014 at Qauia Settlement, Lami in the Central Division, with intent to do some grievous harm to KARALAINI LIKUBUA unlawfully wounded the said KARALAINI LIKUBUA with a kitchen knife.

	1.	Following his plea, a set of relevant facts were put to him, facts which he admitted. He was convicted of the charge.

	2.	The facts admitted are that the accused is aged 31 and employed as a transport assistant. On the day in question, at Lami, he stabbed his sister-in –law over a dispute about repayment of a $20 loan. 

	3.	On the 3rd January 2014, the victim had been in the kitchen after her husband had left for work. The accused was still in the house lying on the sofa in the sitting room. The victim's daughter was also in the sitting room. The victim came into the sitting room to ask her daughter to go with her to Lami Town. The accused asked the victim about the sum of $20 that she owed him. The victim did not reply to which the accused said ""qaraunaiko"" which means ""watch out!""

	4.	The victim went to her room to bath and the accused followed her and stabbed her on the back of the head with a kitchen knife. The victim fell to the floor and blood poured out of her head. She was unable to move her hands or legs. 

	5.	A medical examination revealed that she had a 3cm deep laceration at the right lateral posterior neck. She was hospitalised for 5 days. 

	6.	The accused co-operated with the Police and admitted the offence in his interview under caution. 

Mitigation

	1.	Counsel for the accused tells me that the accused is 32, married with a 5 year old daughter and had worked for a large transport company asa driver's assistant for $120 per week. 

	2.	At the time of the offence the accused had asked for his money back that he had lent the victim but she appeared not to take his request seriously. He was frustrated, took the knife and acted without thought of the consequences. 

	3.	He has no previous convictions with a young family.

	4.	He co-operated with the Police and admitted the offence in his caution interview.

	5.	He is said to be remorseful and has apologized to the victim, his sister-in-law. This has been confirmed by a letter she has written to the court saying that she did not want to pursue the matter any further.

	6.	It is submitted that it was an opportunistic crime and not pre-meditated. He had a sudden surge of anger and acted without thought.

	7.	He has pleaded guilty to the crime which has saved the costs of trial and saved the time of the Court. 

The Law 

	1.	The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. Various cases, but in particular MabaMokubula HAA0052of 2003, have held that the tariff for the offence must be from 2 years to 5 years imprisonment, and more in a domestic violence context. 

16. In the Mokubula case, Shameem J. analysed several cases from the High Court and the Court of Appeal and concluded that in an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range between 2 years and 5 years, depending on the weapon used. She added that a suspended sentence in not appropriate. 

17. Although Shameem J. was considering an appeal of sentence for the identical offence under the Penal Code, the new offence under the Crimes Decree has the same maximum penalty and this Court does now confirm that the tariff is a term of immediate imprisonment from 2 to 5 years, and the nature and danger of the weapon used along with the injuries inflicted will be the determinants of where in that range the starting point is taken.

18. It is to be remembered that reconciliation in a domestic violence offence is hardly ever genuine and it should be only in extremely special circumstances that this offence when it is domestic violence would attract a suspended sentence. In fact sentences for serious cases of acts with intent in domestic violence can attract sentences well in excess of this tariff laid down here. (see for example EmosiTakuTuigulagula [2011} HAC 81 of 2010(Ltk.))

Discussion

19. First and foremost, this offence is an offence of Domestic Violence. Although the victim has written to the court asking that proceedings be stayed, this cannot be done in a domestic violence case. All too often family members are manipulated for one reason or another not to pursue a case against a relative. Perpetrators however must take responsibility for attacks within a family home and all persons, women especially, must be able to live in their own homes without fear of assault or attack. 

20. Section 4 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree (""SPD"") provides special sentencing considerations for an offence of domestic violence which I must consider. It is an aggravating feature in terms of section 4(3)(b) that there was a child presentwhen the attack occurred, and there is the mitigating factor that the accused has taken proven positive steps to accept responsibility for his behavior. 

21. The offence is serious in that it was an attack by means of a knife (an inherently dangerous weapon) on a person in the region of the head and neck. Any attack to the head or spinal area must be viewed with the utmost severity because that is an area that is one of the most vulnerable in the body.

22. It is of course to the accused's credit that he has co-operated, pleaded guilty,and reconciled with his sister-in –law. He is young and has a clear record. 

23. Although the accused pleads provocation, the provocation alleged is very minimal. For the victim to ignore a request to repay his $20 dollars certainly didn't deserve an attack to the head with a kitchen knife. 

24. I take a starting point for this offence a term of 4 years imprisonment. This high starting point subsumes the serious domestic violence attack. For his clear record and relative youth I deduct one year and for his plea of guilty a further year. 

25. The accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. He will serve a term of 18 months before he is eligible to be released on parole. 

26. There is a domestic violence restraining order in effect protecting the victim. That will remain in place until further order.

	1.	In a judgment delivered on 11th October 2013, the court found you guilty of raping the complainant on 5th May 2011, at Lami in the Central Division, contrary to section 207 (1) and 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The court then convicted you accordingly.

	2.	The brief facts were as follows. On 5th May 2011, you were working as the caretaker for the gun site at Veisari Lami. The 13 years 9 months complainant and her aunty came to wash your grandfather's clothes, at his nearby residence, at the time. You were 21 years old at the time. You somehow met the complainant, and offered to show her around your work place. In a dark spot in a nearby cave, you sprang on her, and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. You knew, at the time, that she was not consenting to sex with you. The matter was later reported to police. An investigation was carried out. After a 3 days trial, you were found guilty as charged, for rape. 

	3.	""Rape"", as an offence, is considered one of the more serious offence, in the criminal calendar. Consequently, law makers had prescribed a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009). Previous case laws had set the tariff a sentence between 7 to 16 years imprisonment. The actual sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.

	4.	In this case, the aggravating factors, were as follows:
		(i) Breach of Trust. The complainant came with her aunty to wash your grandfather's clothes. She was 13 years 9 months old and you were 21 years old. You were distantly related. You offered to show her around your work place. You took her around the gun site. In fact, you were laying a trap for her, by taking her to a dark cave, and raped her therein. This was a serious breach of trust. You abused the trust she had in you. 

		(ii) By committing the offence, you showed utter disregard to her right to be treated as a human being, and her right to her personal dignity.

		(iii) You had no regard to her right not to be abused.

	5.	The mitigation factors, were as follows:
		(i) At the age of 23 years, this is your first offence;
		(ii) You are married with one daughter, and you are the sole bread winner;
		(iii) You were remanded in custody from 19th May 2011 to 3rd June 2011, and from 11th October 2013 to 7th November 2013, a period of approximately 7 weeks.

	6.	I start with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 10 years imprisonment. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 7 years imprisonment.

	7.	For raping the complainant on 5th May 2011, I sentence you, Viliame Naicori, to 7 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.

	8.	The name of the female complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

",1,0,1,0,1,sentence,525
16,744,81538,"SENTENCE

Samuela Ledua, by the unanimous opinion of the three assessors, you have been found guilty after trial on one count of attempted murder and one count of incest. I have concurred with these opinions and you have accordingly been convicted.

The facts briefly stated are these. Your marriage relationship with your wife deteriorated and you turned to your daughter for the social and physical intimacy normally reserved for a marriage relationship. You described that life as like a husband and wife.

You admitted to the police that on Tuesday the 30th of September last year you had sexual intercourse with her. You justified that to the Interviewing Policeman by saying:

“We both know what was happening because once I told her that what we were doing is wrong and she replied “its okay it's too late”. It's already happened. She further stated that for me to look after her education well and that we will migrate overseas. She also said that “she will then look after me there and we will be having two children when she have attained the age of twenty-seven (27)”.

It was clear from your police interview that you had a long standing intimate relationship with your daughter. In your own mind at least you thought that secret was safe as no one would ever reveal your relationship as it was “founded both in agreement and founded in truth”. 

As for the attempted murder charge the sad fact is that your daughter unburdened herself and disclosed your relationship with her. You tried to convince your wife and daughter to withdraw that allegation but they did not do so to your satisfaction. You had little sleep and little to eat over the next few days. You became desperate over your daughter’s disclosure and the loss of your relationship.

As an undercover military operative you had long since armed yourself with a bayonet that you kept for protection. You took this bayonet, ran with it to a house where your wife and children were sheltering. Made your way into their bedroom. Confronted your daughter and stabbed her in the chest.

You later surrendered to the police and told Acting Inspector Tui that you had stabbed your daughter to death. You gave as the reason you stabbed her an allegation by your daughter that she had been raped by you. You commented that you were quite satisfied with what you had done.

Your daughter was rushed to hospital. It was discovered she had a large chest wound. She survived your attack.

You were arrested and held in prison on remand awaiting trial. Whilst in prison you and your family reconciled. Your daughter recanted her allegation that you had a sexual relationship with her and said that the knife wound in her chest was somehow caused solely by her and not you.

Given these circumstances the State could not call either your wife or your daughter. They were however available witnesses. They were not called by you at the trial. You have sought to explain why in your mitigation.

I have to sentence you on the basis of the facts displayed in evidence not the facts as you or your family would wish them to be. 

In accordance with that principle the simplest sentencing background to this matter is that you had a sexual relationship with your daughter that you knew was wrong and forbidden. Your daughter told the police. The fact that she broke your unspoken bond angered you; rather than live with that shame you decided to kill her.

These facts speak for themselves. No amount of reconciliation or late conversion can take away the stain of your ugly and deplorable actions.

Background

You are a mature man 37 years old. You are married and have three girls aged 8, 11 and 15 attending primary and secondary school. You are an articulate and intelligent man. You joined the Republic of Fiji Military Forces as a soldier on the 13th of November, 1987 and have served a total of 17 years to date. That service has been with merit. You have served in peacekeeping forces overseas. You are a trained Intelligence Operative working undercover in the Suva community.

You have two previous violence related convictions.

Your Mitigation

You provided the Court last week with a comprehensive letter written in the Fijian language which has been translated by the Court. This letter was supplemented by correspondence from the Fijian Prison Fellowship, a report from your Commanding Officer in the Army and letters from your wife and children. I have considered all of these materials.

The Attempted Murder

Section 214(a) of the Penal Code provides life imprisonment as the maximum available penalty.

In the State v Manieta Navonovono CA HAC0017 of 2001L my brother Justice Govind in sentencing an accused on an attempted murder charge emphasized that apart from punishment for this crime the Courts must sternly sentence offenders to deter others. I agree.

This is a most serious offence. There is no mitigating remorse. You freely admitted these charges to the police. You even commented that you were satisfied with what you had done in stabbing your daughter in the chest. That is a terrifying indictment on your character.

The starting point for this offending in my opinion is a term of imprisonment of 10 years.

The aggravating features are:

1. Your complete lack of remorse.

2. A degree of premeditation and planning in your attempt to kill your daughter.

3. The life threatening injury suffered by her.

4. The complete betrayal of trust between you and your daughter, you should have been her protector not her killer.

5. You are not a first offender. You have previous convictions.

Against these aggravating features are the mitigating factors:

1. You have served your country well. You are a decorated soldier.

2. Although not remorseful you couch your mitigation in terms of your children’s needs and not your own selfish desire to avoid imprisonment. That small comfort stands to your credit.

Although not determinative of sentence I take into account the heartfelt plea of your daughter victim that you not be sent to jail. This plea is supported by her two younger sisters and your wife. While I accept their pleas for clemency they must realise that my obligations go beyond adherence to their needs only.

For all of the aggravating factors I consider the sentence should be increased by a further 4 years making a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. However, against that total term I must take into account the mitigating features and properly acknowledge all of them but especially your dedicated service to the Fijian Military Forces and peacekeeping roles for other nations. Taking the mitigating features into account I would discount the sentence by 4 years making an effective term for imprisonment of 10 years in jail.

The Incest

Section 178 of the Penal Code now provides a penalty of 20 years imprisonment for incest. Prior to June of 2003 the maximum term for offences of this kind was 7 years imprisonment.

The State have indicated by increasing the penalty that this is a most serious offence. Sentencing principles applicable prior to the amendment should still be taken into account but as a result of the increase in the maximum available sentence starting points and overall duration of sentences will naturally increase.

My sister Justice Shameem had occasion to consider sentencing tariffs for incest in various appeals including Sikeli Koro v The State, Criminal Appeal HAA0048 of 2002 and The State v Viliame Tamani, a State Appeal found in Criminal Case 007 of 2003S.

In Tamani at page 5 of her judgment her honour after consideration of the English Court of Appeal in Attorney-General’s reference No. 1 of 1989 90 CR. APP. R.141 laid down guidelines for sentencing in such cases which she considered to be useful in Fiji.

At page 7 her honour said:

“Where the victim is aged between 13 to 16 years, sentences between 5 years and 3 years imprisonment would be appropriate depending on the level of harm to the child and the degree of corruption involved. Where the victim is under the age of 13 a term of 6 years imprisonment would be appropriate. The younger the victim the more likely it is that her will was overborne and the more serious the offending”.

Her honour did comment that where the victim was over the age of 16 years and in special circumstances sentences could range from a nominal penalty to 3 years imprisonment depending on whether there was a degree of force and consideration such as the need to keep the family in tact.

In the light of the statutory amendment I would suggest the following starting points:

1. Where the victim is over the age of 16 and special circumstances exist with a need to keep the family unit intact particularly for counselling and therapy in situations where there has been genuine remorse showed by a contrite offender. Four years imprisonment.

2. Where the victim is aged between 13 to 16 years sentences should find a starting point of 7 to 10 years imprisonment, depending on the level of harm to the child and the degree of corruption involved.

3. Where the victim is subjected to long term sexual abuse from a young age with complete corruption of her life and development. Offenders must expect a starting point of 10 to 15 years imprisonment.

In my view this offending requires a starting point of 6 years imprisonment. I find that you had a long standing intimate relationship with your daughter. However, you are to be sentenced for one act of incest.

Aggravating the offending is 

(1) the complete lack of remorse

(2) gross breach of trust between the father and daughter

(3) the fact that the you beat your daughter up before you had sexual intercourse with her

(4) the level of corruption of the daughter victim as she was led into believing that her sexual relationship with you was normal to such an extent that she is still now completely blinded by your influence over her life.

In terms of mitigating features it is clear:

(1) that you have a genuine affection for your family

(2) no previous sexual offending

(3) other contributions to society

(4) an apparent reconciliation by your family with you,

The aggravating features, in my mind, are balanced out by the mitigating features. I, therefore, order an effective sentence of 6 years imprisonment.

The Totality Principle

This offending, although part of a continuing course of conduct, related to 2 quite separate crimes. You had sex with your daughter then you tried to kill her. I am obliged to consider sentencing you consecutively for each crime.

I would normally have done so, but for the heartfelt pleas of your family and the hope that your 8, 11 and 15 year old may have some realistic prospect of maintaining a relationship with you into their adult lives. I have decided that for them but not you consecutive sentences would be excessive in total. I accordingly order that both sentences be served concurrently. The result is that you go to jail for 10 years.

17,745,247596,"SENTENCE
 
  
• SIRILO WILISONI BURA, you pleaded guilty in this Court to one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree.
 
 
• You also admitted the following summary of facts: 
 

• On Sunday 06/03/2016 at about 1600hours at Valenicina settlement, Lami, Makarita Loalase [accused] 25yrs, a Customer Service Representative with Mindpearland resides at Valenicina was at home with her husband, Sirilo Wilisoni Bura [B-1] 28yrs, unemployed of Valenicina, Lami.
 
 
• [A-1] told [B-1] to wait at home as she wanted to go down to her aunty's place which is just about 10 meters away from where they live.
 
 
• [B-1] was peeling the potatoes when [A-1] told him in a polite manner that she will go to her aunty's place and when she returns home, he can go down to play at the taxi base.
 
 
• An argument started between [A-1] and [B-1] and in the process, [B-1] threw the kitchen knife which he had used to peel potatoes on [A-1]. [A-1] tried to evade the kitchen knife but was late as it hit her right buttock and injured and injured her.
 
 
• Matter was reported to the police where investigation was carried out. [A-1] was medically examined by the doctor on 6/3/16 and after treatment, she was sent home as her condition was generally good.
 
 
• [B-1] was arrested and interviewed under caution and admitted throwing an object which was a stick and not the kitchen knife.
 
 
• However, later in the evening at 2258hrs, [B-1] accompanied the police to his place at Valenicicina and handed to the police the kitchen knife which he threw on [A-1].
 
 
• [B-1] was charged for Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm: Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree no. 44 of 2009.
 
  
• I am satisfied that you made your plea on your own free will and convict you for this offence. 
 

The Law and the Tariff 
 
  
• The maximum penalty for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm under the Crimes Decree is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In State vs Anjula Devi Criminal Case No. 4 of 1998 Lab, it was held that the tariff for ""Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"" ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment or the more serious cases of assault.
 
 
• As for the starting point the UK Sentencing Guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non-domestic context. Therefore the starting point should be same irrespective of whether the parties are known to each other. 
 
 
• Accordingly having considered the gravity of offending I select 06 months as the starting point for this offence. 
 
 
• As this is a domestic violence offence I have taken in to consideration section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree also. 
 

Aggravating Factors 
 
  
• In UK Guidelines following are considered as aggravating factors in domestic violence cases: 
  
• Abuse of trust and abuse of power;
 
• Victim is particularly vulnerable;
 
• Impact on children; 
 
• Using contact arrangements with a child to instigate an offence;
 
• A proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting; 
 
•  history of disobedience to court orders; 
 
• Victim forced to leave home .
 

 
• When sentencing for a domestic violence a court in Fiji can consider the above aggravating factors and any other factors that would further aggravate the offence. 
 
 
• In this case I find the breach of trust, using a kitchen knife to cause injuries are aggravating this offence and add 10 months to reach 16 months imprisonment. 
 

Mitigating Factors 
 
  
• In UK Guidelines the positive good character and provocation are considered as mitigating factors. In this case there is no evidence about provocation even though there was an argument. But for your past good behavior I deduct 04 months to reach 12 months for imprisonment. 
 
 
• You informed me that you have reconciled and the complainant also confirmed that. Having observed her in the Court I accept this as genuine reconciliation and deduct 02 months to reach 10 months imprisonment. 
 

Guilty Plea 
 
  
• For pleading guilty at the first available opportunity following the UK sentencing guidelines of 2007 as well as practice in Fiji I deduct 1/3 to reach 06 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend this sentence. Even though you are a first offender I do not think a suspend sentence is appropriate in this case. You assaulted your wife with a kitchen knife and she is lucky for escaping with these injuries. Your behavior is not acceptable and warrants a custodial sentence. 
 
 
• SIRILO WILISONI BURA, I sentence you to 06 months imprisonment for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree. 
 
 
• For the safety of the complainant I also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal

18,746,266131,"JUDGMENT
 
  
• The appellant was charged in the Magistrate's Court Suva for Causing Grievous Harm contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
• On his own plea of guilty, the appellant was convicted and on 31st July 2014 he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. He appeals his conviction and the sentence on the following grounds.
 

Against the conviction
 
  
• That the Learned Magistrate erred in law in convicting the Appellant when the summary of facts failed to disclose the specific nature of the injuries on the victim to substantiate the offence of grievous harm.
 

Against the sentence
 
  
• That Learned Magistrate erred in law in failing to consider and properly account the issue of provocation as a mitigating factor as outlined in the summary of facts.
 
 
• The 2 years imprisonment sentence was harsh and excessive considering the fact that the appellant was provoked by the victim and his family background.
 

Appellant's submission.
 
  
• It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the summary of facts failed to disclose the specific nature of injuries on the victim to substantiate the element of grievous harm. Also it is submitted that the doctors report does not find any grievous injuries as defined in section 4 (1) of the Crimes Decree.
 
 
• On the appeal on sentence it is submitted that the learned Magistrate has failed to consider the provocation as a mitigating factor.
 

Submission by Respondent (State)
 
  
• It is submitted by the State that although the offence charged in the Magistrate's Court is an indictable offence triable summarily, the Learned Magistrate has not given the choice to the Appellant to elect the court. Therefore the proceeding in the Magistrate's Court as a whole is null and void. Respondent submits that this court should therefore declare the Magistrate's Court proceedings null and void and should remit the case back to the Magistrate's Court for the election to be put to the appellant.
 
 
• On the ground of appeal against the sentence, it is submitted that the summary of facts does not reveal any grievous harm to the victim and therefore State concedes that this ground has merit.
 
 
• It is further submitted that on the admitted summary of facts, this court can convict the appellant for the offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm and sentence the appellant accordingly.
 
 
• Counsel for State (Respondent) made lengthy submission on the issue of the accused not being given the choice to elect the court. After the State's submission, counsel for appellant also agreed that the choice to elect the court was not given to the accused in the Magistrate's Court.
 
 
• However on perusing the Magistrate's Court copy record as well as the original court record I find that the learned Magistrate has rightly given the accused the right to elect the court and that the accused had elected Magistrate's Court. Therefore the submissions made by the State counsel and later by the defence counsel that no choice to elect the court was given are misconceived. 
 
 
• The admitted summary of facts as mentioned in the Magistrates court are: 
 

● On 28/07/14 at about 0600hrs Solomoni (Accused), 35 yrs, labourer of Lot 8 Block 33 Grover lane hit his wife Akanisi Uwe Mariwa (PW-1), 37 years, elections office of above same address with a broom stick (sasa) and also with a piece of wood. 
 
 
● On above date time and place (PW-1) woke up when (Accused) returned home from doing night duty. (PW-1) asked (Accused) if he was having an affair with another lady as she saw (Accused) on the previous day with another lady walking pass the house and she put his clothes outside the house. (Accused) got angry and when he saw his belongings outside the house he kept on arguing with (PW-1) and started beating (PW-1) with a broom stick on her back and pulled her out by her vest and told her to bring his clothes inside the house. Whilst she was still outside (Accused) continued beating her with the broom stick on her back and right side of the leg. After that (Accused) pulled her inside and brought another thick wooden stick and hit her several times on her right side of her thighs and hips, and also on her head whereby she received injuries.
 
 
● The matter was reported and (Accused) was arrested and interviewed under caution.
 
● (Accused) was formally charged for the offence of Grievous Harm: contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
● The (Accused) is appearing in custody at Suva Magistrate's Court on 30/07/2014.
 
 
11. Grievous Harm is defined in section 4(1) of the Crimes Decree.
 
 
'Grievous Harm' means any harm which –
 
 
(a) amounts to a maim or dangerous harm; or
 
(b) seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely so to 
 
injure health; or
 
(c) extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or 
 
serious injury to any external or internal organ, member or sense; 
 
  
• Admitted summary of facts does not disclose any grievous harm as defined. Therefore the learned Magistrate erred when he convicted the accused for causing grievous harm to the complainant although he pleaded guilty, when in fact the admitted summary of facts did not reveal any grievous harm. Therefore I set aside the conviction.
 
 
• However I find that the admitted summary of facts reveals a lesser offence which is Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm. Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 provides for conviction of minor offences included in the offence charged.
 
 
• Section 160 reads:
  
• (1) When a person is charged with an offence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete minor offence, and such combination is proved but the remaining particulars are not proved, the person may be convicted of the minor offence although he or she was not charged with it. 
 
 
• (2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved 


which reduce it to a minor offence, the person may be convicted of the minor offence although he or she was not charged with it. 
 
  
• Accused pleaded guilty in the Magistrate's Court for the offence of causing grievous harm. However the admitted summary of facts does not reveal grievous harm but actual bodily harm. Therefore acting in terms of section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Decree I convict the accused for the minor offence of Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009.
 
 
• The Learned Magistrate has identified the aggravating and mitigating factors correctly. He has considered that this is a domestic violence, that the appellant kept attacking her and also he attacked on her head, as aggravating factors. As mitigating factors the learned Magistrate considered that he was remorseful, married with children and the early guilty plea. 
 
 
• Counsel for Applicant submitted that the Learned Magistrate has not considered the issue of provocation as a mitigating factor. The summary of facts revealed, that when the accused came back after night duty, the victim wife had asked the accused about him having an affair with another lady. Apart from that, the complainant had put the clothes and the belongings of the accused outside the house where the argument started which led to the assault.
 
 
• I find that the wife putting his clothes out of the house is no excuse for him to assault the wife as he had done in this case. However court will consider this also as a mitigating factor as he may have got provoked by seeing his clothes out of the house, although it cannot to be taken as a defence for the assault.
 
 
• In Semisi Botaki V. State [2012] FJHC 1250; HAA015.2012 (1 August 2012) Justice Madigan affirmed the sentence of 7 months imprisonment imposed on the accused where he assaulted his wife including her head which was a domestic violence. It was observed that 10 months starting point was appropriate in that case.
 
 
• I take 10 months as the starting point. I add another 8 months for the aggravating factors and deduct 7 months for the mitigating factors. I deduct further 3 months for the early guilty plea. Therefore now the final sentence is at 8 months imprisonment.
 
 
• Hence, the appeal is allowed and sentence varied.
 
 
•  For the safety of the victim, a final Domestic Violence Restraining Order is made.
 
 
• The appellant was sentenced by the Magistrate's Court on 31/07/2014 and he now has served more than 8 months. Therefore as the appellant has already served the sentence, I order that the appellant be released from the prison forthwith.

(The name of the complainant is suppressed she will be referred to as “LD”)
 
 
[1] In a Judgment delivered on 29 June, 2017 the court found the accused guilty and convicted him for one count of rape as per the following information:-
 
COUNT ONE
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2) (a) and 3 of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
WAISAKE WAININIMA between the 1st day of December, 2012 and 30th day of December 2012 at Fiji Sugar Corporation Quarters, Rakiraki in the Western Division penetrated the vagina of “LD”, a child under the age of 13 years, with his penis. 
 
 
[2] The brief facts were as follows:
 
 
The complainant who was 11 years of age and a class 5 student resided with her parents and two elder brothers at FSC Compound in Rakiraki. She knew the accused who was a distant cousin.
 
 
[3] On a day between 1 December, 2012 and 30 December, 2012 whilst the complainant’s parents were in Suva the accused and his friends came to the house of the complainant, together with her two brothers they all went to the river for a swim. 
 
 
[4] The complainant was alone at home after a while the accused came back at this time the complainant was in her bedroom. In the bedroom the accused started kissing the complainant and then forcefully grabbed her and told her to take off her clothes. The complainant did as she was told since she was not strong enough to resist. 
 
 
[5] The accused made the complainant lie on the bed took out his penis and inserted it into her vagina. The complainant felt pain so she told the accused to go away which he did.
 
 
[6] The complainant was frightened and shocked she did not know what to do. The complainant’s aunt one evening saw the accused putting his hands around the buttocks of the complainant. The aunt of the complainant suspected something was happening to the complainant. The complainant’s father was informed and the matter was reported to the police.
 
 
[7] Both counsel have filed written sentencing submissions.
 
 
[8] Counsel for the accused presented the following personal details and mitigation on behalf of the accused:
 
 
 (a) The accused is 25 years of age;
 (b) First offender;
 
(c) The accused apologizes to the complainant and her family and stands ready to talk to them to express his remorse;
 
(d) The accused was a security guard at Vatukoula Gold Mines Ltd, he is in a de-facto relationship and the couple expects their first child in September this year; 
(e) Whatever has happened is completely out of character;
(f) The accused seeks the mercy of the court in sentencing;
 
(g) The accused cooperated with the Police during the course of investigation.
 
 
[9] I accept in accordance with the Supreme Court decision in Anand Abhay Raj vs. The State, CAV 0003 of 2014 that the personal circumstances of an accused person has little mitigatory value in cases of sexual nature.
 
 
[10] Furthermore counsel for the accused at paragraph 5.01 of his written mitigation submission stated:
 
 
 “The Accused humbly submits to the Honorable Court that he had to maintain his not guilty plea during the cause of the trial as he had not committed the offence. He further submits he could not admit to something that he rightfully believe he had not done. It is against his character, his upbringing and principles. On the other hand, the Accused being the person he is would be the first person to admit the offence if he had indeed committed it.”
 
 
[11] It is unfortunate that counsel for the accused has embarked into making such incongruous comments on behalf of the accused knowing very well that the court has already convicted the accused. It is the duty of counsel to file submissions in court that are appropriate in its contents. Whilst the comments made shall not be taken against the accused I will also desist from making a finding whether the paragraph in question amounts to contempt of court. 
 
 
[12] The aggravating features are:
 
 
 (a) Breach of trust

The victim is related to the accused as a distant cousin who trusted the accused. The incident happened in the house of the complainant when she was alone. The accused breached the trust of a helpless and vulnerable victim.
 
 
 (b) Age difference

At the time of the offending the victim was 11 years of age a primary school student and the accused was 20 years of age. The age difference of 9 years is substantial.
 
 
 [13] The maximum penalty for the offence of rape is life imprisonment which means this offence falls under the most serious category of offences. The Supreme Court of Fiji in Anand Abhay Raj (supra) has confirmed that the tariff for the rape of a juvenile is now a sentence between 10 years to 16 years imprisonment. 
 
 
[14] Bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence committed I take 11 years imprisonment as the starting point of the sentence. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors bringing the interim total to 15 years imprisonment. Although the personal circumstances and family background of the accused has little mitigatory value, however, I find the accused good character has substantive mitigating value. I therefore reduce the sentence by 2 years. 
 
 
[15] I note the accused has been in remand for about 129 days which is about 4 months and 9 days in exercise of my discretion I reduce the sentence for the remand period by 4 ½ months in accordance with section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act as a period of imprisonment already served by the accused. The final sentence is 12 years and 7 ½ months imprisonment. 
 
 
[16] Having considered section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act and the serious nature of the offence committed on the victim who was 11 years of age compels me to state that the purpose of this sentence is to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances of the case and to deter offenders and other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature. 
 
 
[17] Under section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I impose 9 years as a non-parole period to be served before the accused is eligible for parole. I consider this non-parole period to be appropriate in the rehabilitation of the accused which is just in the circumstances of this case.
 
 
[18] Mr. Waininima you have committed a serious offence against a victim who trusted you and was related to you. I am sure the complainant will not easily forget what you had done to her, rather than protecting her you have scarred her life forever by what you have done to her. No amount of remorse or regret will bring back what the victim had lost. The court has an obligation to protect the vulnerable from any form of sexual abuse and an immediate long term custodial sentence is warranted.
 
 
 [19] In summary I pass a sentence of 12 years and 7 ½ months imprisonment for one count of rape that the accused has been convicted of with a non-parole period of 9 years to be served before the accused is eligible for parole.
 
 
[20] 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

[1] Mr Joseva Veivali (Accused) was found guilty after trial and was convicted by this Court on following count. He now comes before this Court for sentence.
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and (2) (a) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
JOSEVA VEIVALI, between the 01st day of January 2012 and the 24th day of April 2012 at Lautoka in the Western Division, penetrated the vagina of AT.
 
 
[2] The facts of the case in brief were that:
 
 
Accused stood in relationship of the biological father of the victim. During the period mentioned in the information, accused and victim visited victim's mother who was in hospital expecting a baby. They stayed at a friend's place in Lautoka. Whilst staying there, accused asked victim to go down the river and asked her to take off her undergarment. Then he took out his penis and put it into her vagina. Victim was seven years old and accused was forty-seven years old when the incident occurred.
 
 
After doing this, accused warned the victim that if she were to tell anyone he will chop her into pieces. She, however, related the incident to her uncle who then reported the matter to police. Upon internal examination of victim's vagina, doctor found her hymen not intact and opined that she had experienced sexual intercourse. When the Information was filed, accused pleaded guilty to the charge of sexual assault and was sentenced.
 
 
Maximum Sentence
 
 
[3] The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment.
 
 
 Tariff for Rape
 
 
[4] It is now well settled, and confirmed by the Supreme Court in AnandAbhay Raj CAV003.2014 that the tariff for rape of a juvenile is 10-16 years' imprisonment.
 
 
 Starting Point
 
 
[5] Rape is a serious crime. By prescribing life imprisonment for Rape convicts, the law makers expect Courts to impose harsher punishment on such offenders.
 
 
[6] In State v. AV [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192 21.02.2009 it was stated that:
 
 
""rape is the most serious form of sexual assault.... Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children ... Sexual offenders
 
 
[7] Not only the offender himself but also the potential offenders must be deterred. The sentence must send a clear warning to the society. The offender must be severely punished and be incarcerated to ensure that our younger generation is safe and secure in domestic environment.
 
 
[8] In the case of Mohammed Kasim v. State [1994] FJCA 25; AAU 0021j.93S (27 May 1994) it was stated that;
 
 
""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of Rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point"". (emphasis is mine).
 
 
[9] In State v Mario Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 Justice Paul Madigan stated that:
 
 
""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""
 
 
[10] Accused's actions demonstrate a total disregard of clearly defined societal, religious and traditional norms that prohibit any kind of sexual relationship between father and daughter. Having considered the culpability of the offending and the impact of the accused's actions on the victim, I pick thirteen years (13) as the starting point.
 
 
 Aggravated Circumstances
 
 
[11] The age gap between them is nearly forty years. In principle, the younger the child and the greater the age gap between the offender and the victim, the higher then sentence should be.
 
 
[12] The accused is the biological father of the victim. Victim's mother admitted herself to the hospital to deliver a baby. He breached the trust as the father and exploited her vulnerability when her mother is in hospital.
 
 
[13] Accused used his authority over the victim and instilled fear in her to cover up the offending.
 
 
[14] According to the Victim Impact Statement filed, victim has suffered physically and psychologically. She lost her virginity at very young age. Offending left a scar and trauma for the rest of her life.
 
 
[15] Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and maintained that position right throughout the trial. By doing so, he has not saved the young girl from giving evidence and reliving the ordeal. He has thereby not shown remorse and repentance.
 
 
[16] I consider the accused's case as a classic case of domestic violence that must attract higher sentence. Under Domestic Violence Decree 2009 domestic violence offence necessarily encompasses raping a daughter.
 
 
 Mitigating Circumstances
 
 
[17] Accused cooperated with police.
 
 
[18] He is first offender and has maintained a clear record. He expressed his remorse when he was found guilty. He promises not to reoffend and seeks mercy of this court. He has already served nearly three years in prison where he had undergone correction program.
 
 
 Sentence
 
 
[19] I add three (3) years to the starting point for above mentioned aggravating factors bringing the interim sentence to sixteen (16) years' imprisonment. I deduct 1 year for the above mentioned mitigating factors bringing the sentence for Rape count to fifteen (15) years' imprisonment.
 
 
[20] Accused was in remand/prison for a period of four years (He had been in remand since 30th April 2012 until he was sentenced for Sexual Assault charge on 18thFebruary 2013). Thus a period of four years (4) is deducted from the sentence. Now the final sentence for Rape count is eleven (11) years' imprisonment. This sentence is concurrent to the sentence already imposed for Sexual Assault charge.
 
 
[21] Acting under Section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose a non-parole period of ten years.
 
 
[22] 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

21,749,77160,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] On 19 November 2004 the petitioner was charged in the magistrates court at Nadi with offences of abduction, wrongful confinement and rape of his wife. They had been separated for a long time. He appeared for himself, elected trial in the magistrates court, and pleaded guilty to all charges. The offences which occurred on 27 October 2004 were the subject of prompt complaint to relatives and the police. The petitioner made repeated admissions noted in the record of the magistrates court. 

[2] The magistrate sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment on the first and second counts and 6 years on the count for rape to be served consecutively making a total of 10 years. He appealed against his sentence to the High Court and was again self represented, and did not seek leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty. 

[3] On 8 April 2005 Govind J allowed the appeal and re-sentenced the petitioner to a total of 9 years imprisonment. On 14 February 2006 the petitioner sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal out of time from his sentence, although some of his grounds appeared to challenge his conviction. Ward P, granted him leave to appeal limited to 2 grounds, the sentence imposed on the conviction for wrongful confinement and whether the rape of a wife by her husband is an offence known to the law in Fiji. 

[4] At the hearing of the appeal he was represented by counsel from the Legal Aid Office. The Court of Appeal upheld his appeal against the 2 years sentence for wrongful confinement which exceeded the maximum of 1 year’s imprisonment under the Code. 

[5] Despite having received extensive submissions on the appeal against conviction prepared by counsel for the Legal Aid office and the Director of Public Prosecutions the petitioner confined his appeal to the Court of Appeal from his conviction for rape to the question of his wife’s actual consent to sexual intercourse. Since he had pleaded guilty and his plea was unequivocal his appeal against conviction was dismissed. 

[6] His appeal against sentence was allowed and he was re-sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 7 years thereby achieving a further reduction of 2 years in the total period he would spend in custody. The petitioner now seeks leave to appeal to this Court from his conviction and sentence. The petition does not raise any question of general legal importance or principle and there is no basis for finding that a substantial or grave injustice has occurred. 

[7] In view of the petitioner’s pleas of guilty in the magistrate court and the High Court and the approach he adopted in the Court of Appeal in his appeal against the conviction for rape on the ground that his wife gave her actual consent to sexual intercourse this is not an appropriate case in which to consider whether or not the law of Fiji permits a husband to force sexual intercourse on his wife without her consent. 

[8] The petitioner has also raised questions about Mr Shah, the magistrate who heard the cases against him and imposed the initial sentences. He has also raised questions about the findings of Connors J in his inquiry into the Magistrates Court. 

[9] This Court cannot investigate the petitioner’s claims about the record in the magistrates court at Nadi raised here for the first time nearly 4 years after the event. The allegations are irrelevant in view of his pleas of guilty in the Magistrates Court the maintenance of those pleas in the High Court, and his challenge to his conviction for rape in the Court of Appeal. Accordingly the petition case is dismissed.

22,750,257330,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused was tried in this court on one count of rape, one count of sexual assault and three counts of indecently annoying a person. He was convicted of the three indecently annoying counts and the rape but acquitted of the sexual assault count. 
 
 
[2] At the time of the offences the accused was an Inspector of Police and the officer-in-charge (“OC”) of the Taveuni Police Station. He had been posted to that station in February 2013 by the then Commissioner of Police toregularize matters after numerous complaints against the Island Police and their service. However the evidence suggests that under his control he added a further dimension to the problems there; a climate of sexual harassment.
 
 
[3] Three very junior female Police Officers told the Court of his authoritarian and oppressive management style. He told one married WPC to have an affair before subsequently raping her; he told another that he wanted to have an affair with her and he pestered the third single female volunteerwith obscene and suggestive phone calls. 
 
 
Mitigation
 
 
[4] In written mitigation provided to the court, Counsel submits that his client is 47 years of age and has a clear record. He has served as a member of the Force for 21 years. 
 
 
[5] The accused claims to have served in the Sudan on a peace mission for the U.N. for 14 months in 2007.
 
 
[6] He represented Fiji in a team playing in the Rugby League World Cup in 1993. 
 
 
[7] He has received a Commendation Medal for Long Service in the Police Force. 
 
 
[8] He is the Sole breadwinner and Counsel submits “he has been the corner stone in his family’s strife”, whatever that might mean.
 
 
[9] The accused called two character witnesses in mitigation; the first being Senior Superintendent Singh, the Divisional Police Commander (Northern) who testified that he knows the accused very well and knows him to be experienced and very mature.
 
 
[10] The accused’s wife told the Court that they had been married for 20 years and they had two daughters. He had been a loving husband and fully supported the family. 
 
 
Aggravation
 
 
[11] The Court finds that all four offences that the accused has been convicted of are aggravated by the fact that at the time of offending the accused was the professional Superior of the three women in question. He was in a position of professional care and his words and actions were in breach of that professional care. The women were obviously cowered by his status in the station and by what they testified to be his overbearing and authoritive persona. 
 
 
[12] Each of the offences he is convicted of has its own particular aggravating feature(s) which the Court will deal with post.
 
 
The Law
 
 
[13] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment. The band of sentences mandated for the rape of an adult person is still the band set by the Court of Appeal in Kasim(unreported) Cr. Appeal 14 of 1993 (27 May 1994) which is from 7 to 15 years.
 
 
[14] The maximum penalty for Indecently annoying another is imprisonment for one year without a tariff having been set; nor need there be one. There are a myriad ways in which a person can be sexually harassed and the sentence will be at the discretion of the court hearing the matter.
 
 
Discussion
 
 
[15] The rape conviction being the most serious will become the foundation sentence in this exercise. 
 
 
[16] Although the victim junior Policewoman submitted to this personal invasion without demur, she testified that she had no choice . It was her boss the OC and he had been trying to persuade her late at night in a deserted place for more than 30 minutes that he wanted to have sex with her. Her lack of consent therefore is covered by the provisions of Section 206(2)(d) of the Crimes Decree 2009 which negates consent when it is obtained by the exercise of authority. 
 
 
[17] Apart from the aggravation referred to supra it is further aggravating that this assault was perpetrated late at night in a very remote part of the Island while the two were returning from a Police operation. The accused had told the woman he was taking her home but he diverted the Police vehicle to the remote spot to press upon her his sexual desire. 
 
 
[18] In addition to the indignity occasioned to her by the rape she was further deprived of her dignity by being assaulted by her superior in the back of a Police Vehicle.
 
 
[19] For the rape I take a starting point of 7 years imprisonment. For the severe aggravation of the vast difference in their respective status in the force I add to this a further 5 years imprisonment. For the indignities of late night, deserted place, and on the back seat of a Police vehicle I add a further two years tothe sentence. This brings the interim total to 14 years imprisonment. 
 
 
[20] I acknowledge the accused’s service to his country in peace keeping and his long service to the Police Force. In the spirit of BatiratuHAR 001 of 2012 per Gates CJ I discount the accused’s sporting achievement. 
 
 
[21] However I endorse the dicta of Goundar J. in Vocea HAC 129 of 2009, ( para20):
 
 
 “In the end, however, it is not possible for me to give undimished weight to your previous good character and record of public service .....You were given power and authority. With power and authority comes an obligation of trust. You betrayed that trust and in the course of doing that, you diminished the very values that were your duty to uphold.”
 
 
[22] These sentiments are particularly apposite to the circumstances in this case. For the credit that would and should have been given to the accused for his record of public service, a diminution of that time must follow his failure to set a good example of public service and his breach of trust.
 
 
[23] From the 14 years interim I deduct one year for his clear record and one year for his personal mitigation.
 
 
[24] For the rape of his junior officer I sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment of 12 years. He will serve a total term of 10 years before being eligible for parole. 
 
 
[25] The three offences of indecently annoying a person, while insignificant when compared with the rape, are nevertheless serious in the context of a Police Station. Although the name of the offence is old fashioned it amounts to no less than sexual harassment and sexual harassment in the work place in Fiji cannot be tolerated. 
 
 
[26] These three convictions displayed arrogant, condescending and presumptuous behaviour towards the three women in question. 
 
 
[27] The maximum penalty being 12 months imprisonment and in considering all the aforesaid mitigating and aggravating features I sentence the accused to 6 months imprisonment on Counts 1, 4 and 5. These three terms are to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the term of imprisonment imposed for Rape (Count 3).
 
 
[28] The total term that this accused shall serve will be a term of 12 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 10 years.

23,751,72534,"ORDER OF SUMMARY DISMISSAL

On 4 February 2000 the appellant was sentenced by the Magistrate’s Court at Labasa to three years’ imprisonment for the offence of attempted rape on his own plea of guilty.

Although the Petition of Appeal states that the appeal is against conviction and sentence it is actually an appeal against severity of sentence as per the grounds of appeal filed by the appellant.

He admitted the facts as outlined by the prosecution. The manner in which he went about committing the offence was serious particularly when he had a knife in his hand and threatened to kill the complainant if she did not succumb to his demands for sexual intercourse with him. He even removed her ‘T’ shirt with the knife, sliced it, took it out and cut the ‘bra’ as well.

This was a serious offence. Had she not managed to run away from his clutches it is anybody’s guess as to what would have happened.

The sentence was neither harsh nor excessive. It was not wrong in principle either.

I hereby certify that I have perused the record in this case and am satisfied that this appeal has been lodged without any sufficient ground of complaint. The appeal is therefore summarily dismissed under the provisions of section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap.21.

24,752,75757,"SENTENCE

[1] Henry Fisher, you appear before this Court for sentence, after being convicted of two counts of rape. The first count concerns digital rape while the second count concerns penile rape. The offences were committed on two separate occasions in Yadua Island, Bua. You resided in Vakasa settlement with your wife and five children in a house provided by your employer. In the beginning of the first school term in 2011, the victim who was your niece came and resided with you and your family. Your wife Susana Vaseva gave evidence that both of you took responsibility to send the victim to a school and to educate her. At the time, the victim was 10 years old and was attending a primary school in the island. 

[2] The first incident of digital rape occurred at nighttime while the victim was asleep with you and your wife. You inserted your fingers inside the victim's vagina. She said she felt pain and started crying. You warned the victim not to tell anyone about the incident. The second incident of penile rape occurred during daytime when you found the victim alone at your home. You undressed her and inserted your penis inside her vagina. The victim said she did not report the incidents to her aunty because she feared her aunty would not believe her.

[3] You were the victim's guardian and an authority figure when you sexually violated her. The victim's parents entrusted their daughter to you for care and protection. You breached the trust of the victim and her parents. The victim's tender age made her vulnerable. The first incident occurred shortly after the victim moved in to live with you and your family. The second incident occurred later in the first school term. The vulnerability of the victim due to her tender age, the breach of trust and the repeated rape are the aggravating factors in this case. 

[4] I accept that you did not use any physical violence on the victim. The State did not lead any evidence of victim impact. However, when the victim gave evidence, the psychological trauma became apparent when she broke down in tears on numerous occasions. 

[5] The only compelling mitigating factor is your previous good character. You are 47 years old and married with five children. You also have two other children out of wedlock who you support. You also support your 80-year old mother who lives on her own. Your wife and children are financially depended on you. You were supporting your family through your employment as a boat captain for a diving business. You have attained up to class 7 primary level education. The sentence will have an impact on your employment and your family. Your wife and children will have to move out from the house they are currently occupying and manage without any regular source of income. Your previous good character and personal and family circumstances are the mitigating factors in this case.

[6] However, sexual offences against children are becoming too prevalent in our society especially in our rural communities where the children are more vulnerable because the perpetrators hold positions of authority. The courts have a duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our society and to impose sentence that reflects society's disapproval of the offence. 

[7] In cases of rape of a child, the tariff is between 10 to 14 years imprisonment (Mutch v State, Cr. App. AAU0060/99, Mani v State, Cr. App. No. HAA0053/02L, State v Saitava, Cr. Case No. HAC10/07, State v Marawa, Cr. Case No. 016/03, Drotini v State, Cr. App. AAU001/05 and State v Tony, Cr. App. No. HAA003/08).

[8] I pick 10 years as my starting point. I increase the sentence to 14 years to reflect the aggravating factors and reduce 2 years and 5 months to reflect the mitigating factors. You were in custody on remand for nearly 7 months. I further reduce your sentence by 7 months to reflect the remand period. 

[9] On each count of rape, I sentence you to 11 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years, to be served concurrently.

• In a judgment delivered on 28 November, 2018 this court found both the accused persons guilty and convicted them for a count of rape as per the following:
 

FIRST COUNT
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 2 (a) of the Crimes Act, 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
INIA NAQIA on the 3rd day of April, 2015 at Nadi in the Western Division penetrated the vagina of ANI TINAI, with his penis, without the consent of the said ANI TINAI.
 
SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 2 (a) of the Crimes Act, 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
MAIKELI SAUKURU on the 3rd day of April, 2015 at Nadi in the Western Division penetrated the vagina of ANI TINAI, with his penis, without the consent of the said ANI TINAI.
 
 
2. The brief facts were as follows:
 
 On 3rd April, 2015 the victim was drinking alcohol with both the accused persons in the early hours of the morning at the back of a dairy shop near Saunaka Village. 
 
 
3. The drinking finished after 9am that morning. The victim went to the nearby sugar cane field to relieve herself where she blacked out. When she regained consciousness both the accused persons were holding her tight. They removed her clothes, the first accused Inia started to touch all over her body while the second accused forcefully started kissing her mouth, to stop him she bit his lips.
 
 
4. Both the accused persons took turns in having sexual intercourse with her by penetrating her vagina with their penis. The first accused had sexual intercourse first followed by the second accused. The victim did not give consent to any of the accused to have sexual intercourse with her.
 
 
5. After both the accused persons left the victim walked back to the village where she told her friend Solomoni Qurai what the two accused had done to her.
 
 
6. The matter was immediately reported to the police, upon investigations both the accused were arrested and charged.
 
  
• Both the state and defence counsel filed written sentence submissions for which this court is grateful.
 
 
• Counsel for the accused persons presented the following details and mitigation:
 

 FIRST ACCUSED
 
 
 a) The accused was 28 years of age at the time of the offending;
 
 b) He was a first offender;
 
 c) Married with 2 young children (5 years and 6 months respectively), resides with elderly parents;
 
 d) Unemployed assists wife in taking care of children;
 
 e) Promises not to re-offend, willing to reform, seeks leniency. 
 
 
 SECOND ACCUSED 
 
 
 a) The accused was 20 years of age at the time of the offending;
 
 b) He was a first offender;
 
 c) He resides with his parents and siblings in Saunaka Village;
 
 d) He is currently unemployed;
 
 e) He cooperated with the police during investigation;
 
 f) He seeks forgiveness. 
 
  
• I accept in accordance with the Supreme Court decision in Anand Abhay Raj vs the State, CAV 0003 of 2014 that the personal circumstances and family background of an accused person has little mitigatory value in cases of sexual nature.
 
 
• The aggravating features are: 
• (a) Breach of Trust


The victim and both the accused persons were known to each other and living in the same village. Both the accused persons breached the trust of the victim by what they did to her.
 
 
 (b) Vulnerable Victim

The victim was drunk, vulnerable and alone. Both the accused persons took advantage of the victim’s situation and committed the unlawful acts. Two accused persons overpowering the victim.
 
  
• The maximum penalty for the offence of rape is life imprisonment which means this offence falls under serious category of offences. The accepted tariff for the rape of an adult is a sentence between 7 years to 15 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal had stated:

“We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than the starting point.”
 
  
• It is the duty of the court to protect women from sexual violations of any kind that is the reason why the law makers have imposed life imprisonment for the offence of rape as the maximum penalty.
 
 
• Bearing in mind the seriousness of the offences committed for both the accused persons I take 8 years imprisonment as the starting point of their sentence. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, bringing an interim total of 11 years imprisonment. Although the personal circumstances and family background of the accused has little mitigatory value, however, I find their good character has substantive mitigating value. I therefore reduce the sentence by 2 years. The sentence now is 9 years imprisonment.
 
 
• I note the accused persons have been in remand for about 1 month and 18 days. I exercise my discretion to further reduce the sentence for the remand period by 2 months in accordance with section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act as a period of imprisonment already served. 
 
 
• The final sentence of imprisonment for the offence of rape is 8 years and 10 months.
 
 
•  Having considered section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act and the serious nature of the offences committed on the victim compels me to state that the purpose of this sentence is to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances of the case and to deter offenders and other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature. 
 
 
•  Under section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I impose 8 years as a non-parole period to be served before the accused is eligible for parole. I consider this non-parole period to be appropriate in the rehabilitation of the accused which is just in the circumstances of this case.
 
 
•  Mr. Naqia and Mr. Saukuru you have committed a serious crime against a victim who trusted you. In this case the victim was known to both of you. I am sure it will be difficult for the victim to forget what both of you had done to her. Your actions towards the victim were deplorable and selfish. This court will be failing in its duty if a long term deterrent custodial sentence was not imposed. The victim was alone and vulnerable and you took advantage of this. 
 
 
•  In summary Mr. Naqia and Mr. Saukuru you are to serve a sentence of 8 years and 10 months imprisonment each for the offence of rape with a non-parole period of 8 years to be served before you are eligible for parole. 
 
 
•  30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal

(The name of the complainant is suppressed, the complainant will be referred to as “MK”)
 
  
• In a judgment delivered on 9 June, 2016 the court found the accused guilty and convicted him for the lesser offence of defilement.
 
 
• The brief facts of the case were as follows:
 

The accusedmet the complainant “MK” whilst he was a construction worker working on the Wairikibridge in August 2014. After three consecutive meetingsthe accused invited the complainant to his room after she had come to the camp site where the accused was staying. 
 
On this night the accused did not have sexual intercourse with her.However, it was the next day that is 18th August 2014,there was sexual intercourse between the two. The complainant was 15 years of age and the accused was 38 years of age at that time. It was during the second meeting the accused informed the complainant that he wanted to have a relationship with her to which she agreed. Since the complainant was missing from her home her father reported her as a missing person. The complainant’s uncle came and took her with him to his house. 
 
  
• Defilement is having sexual intercourse with a girl between the age of 13 and 16. It is a serious offence which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Both counsels have assisted the court by written and oral submissions in support which is appreciated by the court.
 
 
• Counsel for the accused presented the following mitigation on behalf of the accused:
  
• The accused was 38 years of age at the time of the offending;
 
• Sole bread winner of the family looking after his elderly father who is 81 years old;
 
• He was a first offender;
 
• Accused mother passed away when he was 21 years old;
 
• Accused has been in remand for 5 months and 1 day.
 

 
• The accused called his father to give evidence on his behalf. His father informed the court that he was 81 years of age. The accused was the sole breadwinner for the family. He is the only son he has and that the accused has been taking care of him. The accused was doing subsistence farming and would buy him his basic needs. He is basically dependent on his son.
 
 
• Counsel further says that this was a case of virtuous relationship and was a non-exploitive relationship. Counsel justifies this by saying that if it was not for the complainant’s father and the police, she would be still in a relationship with the accused. Further, counsel submitted that the accused on the first night together at his place respected her and did not exploit her. The accused had sexual intercourse only on the second night with the complainant. This was not a case of breach of trust or blood relations. Counsel relies on State v PraneetAnand Reddy High Court Case No. 96 of 2011 and State v Jese Kalounivalu High Court Case No. 10 of 2014. Counsel finally submitted that considering the current tariff for the offences of defilement if the final sentence is 3 years or less than a suspended sentence be considered. 
 
 
• The State Counsel submitted that there was a vast age difference between the complainant and the accused which was 23 years. There was no virtuous relationship since after three days of meeting there was sexual intercourse. The State Counsel stressed that the 23 years of age difference was an aggravating factor leading to the sexual exploitation of a child. The sentence should be one which will be a deterrent to the others. She further stated that a custodial sentence with a non-parole period will be justified. State Counsel relied on the case of EremasiRinasau v State High Court Case No. HAM 203 of 2014 and State v ShiuBalak High Court Case No. HAC 260 of 2014.
 
 
• I accept the accused was 38 years of age at the time of the offending whereas the victim was 15 years of age. The age difference is substantial.
 
 
• From the evidence of the accused it was obvious that he did not have any affection towards the complainant and never appeared interested in a relationship, although he had proposed to her in an earlier meeting that he wanted to have a relationship. It appeared to me that he was too keen to have sex with this young complainant. As a matured adulthe was expected to be more responsible.
 
 
• The current sentencing tariff for the offence of defilement is from a suspended sentence to 4 years imprisonment(EliaDonumainasava v State [2001] HAA 32/01S, 18 May 2001). In State v Pita Vetaukula Criminal Case No. HAC 46 of 2013 (8 July 2014), this Court stated that suspended sentences are appropriate in cases of non-exploitive relationship between persons of similar age, while custodial sentence are appropriate in cases of sexual exploitation of younger girls by older men who hold a position of authority over the girls.
 
 
• In Vetaukula (supra), the offender was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to a charge of defilement. The offender was the headman of the village. He was 22 years old when he defiled a 15 year old from his village. In sentencing the offender the court said:
 

The courts have a duty to protect the young girls from any form of sexual exploitation. In cases of sexual exploitationof young girls, the primary purpose of the sentence is general deterrence. Rehabilitation of the offender is a secondary purpose.
 
  
• Suspended sentences are reserved for couples who are in a genuine “virtuous relationship” where there is evidence of a committed boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. This is not the case here. The accused met the complainant on three occasions only and from hisevidence in court it became obvious that he was not genuinely committed towards her. I do not accept that there was a virtuous, non exploitive relationship. 
 
 
• There has been an increase in offences of this kind in particular where the accused are matured adults. Having sexual intercourse with a girl of 15 years by a man who is more than twice her age is a sad indictment on the society. It appears that there are people in the community who do not pay any heed to the warnings given by court. The offence of defilement has been enacted to protect young girls from people like the accused. The accused has not shown any respect to a person who was just venturing to better things in life but for his personal lust. 
 
 
• It is the duty of the court to hand down a sentence which actsas a deterrent to the would be perpetrators. 
 
 
• In view of the above I take as a starting point 2 years imprisonment, to it I add 1 year 6 months been for the vast age difference as an aggravating factor bringing the interim total to 3 years 6 months imprisonment. For the mitigating factor I reduce the sentence by 1 year and I make a further deduction of 5 months for his remand period. The total imprisonment now stands at 2 years 1 month. Under section 18 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree, I imposed a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months before the accused is eligible for parole. In all the circumstances of the case suspension is not appropriate and I refuse to make such an order.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

•  Mr. PITA NATEKURU, Mr. LAITIA NALAWA and Mr. JALE FATIAKI, on the 19th day of July 2018, all off you were convicted on the following count: 

FIRST COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
AGGRAVATED ROBBERY: Contrary to Section 311(1) (a) read with Sections 45 and 46 of the Crimes Act, 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
PITA NATEKURU, LAITIA NALAWA and JALE FATIAKI, on the 10th day of March 2014, at Volivoli, Rakiraki, in the Western Division, dishonestly appropriated (stole) 1 x Dell laptop valued at $900; 1 x Acer Tablet valued at $600; 1 x Toshiba Laptop valued at $300; 1 x FUJI camera valued at $300; 1 x CANON camera valued at $300; 1 x APPLE I-phone valued at $500; 1 x Ladies purple bag valued at $100; 1 x Prada ladies bag valued at $100; 1 x Gold plated watch valued at $29; 2 x Sunglasses valued at $175; 2 x Hats valued at $30; Car keys with tags valued at $300; $260 cash in Fijian currency; $300 Canadian currency, $140.00 cash in US Currency, 1 x ALCATEL phone valued at $800; Assorted cigarettes valued at $99; 1 x Wi-Fi device valued at $200; 7 x 350ml Fiji Bitter Stubby valued at $21; 1 x Phillips DVD deck valued at $800; and 1 bottle of wine valued at $15, all to the total value of $6269.00 and being the property of Marian Lavictoire and William Masek, and prior to stealing the said items PITA NATEKURU, LAITIA NALAWA and JALE FATIAKI used force on MARIAN LAVICTOIRE and WILLIAM MASEK.
 
  
• Mr. PITA NATEKURU, in addition to the 1st count, you were also convicted of the following count:
 

SECOND COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and (2)(a) of the Crimes Act, 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
PITA NATEKURU, on the 10th day of March 2014, at Volivoli, Rakiraki, in the Western Division, had carnal knowledge of MARIAN LAVICTOIRE without the said MARIAN LAVICTOIRE’s consent.
 
  
• You now come before this court for sentence. All of you were convicted on the 1st count of Aggravated Robbery. Marian Lavictoire and William Masek, the victims of this case are Canadian nationals. They had come to spend a holiday in your beautiful islands in expectation of world renowned hospitality and smiles of Fijians. They were leisurely holidaying at Star Fish Villa in Volivoli. You secretly planned to rob them of their belongings. When the victims were watching television, you forced open a window and entered the villa in a horrific night time invasion. You were armed with offensive weapons. You frightened and threatened the tourists in a ruthless manner. You ransacked their belongings to the total value of $6,269.00. Upon being arrested, you admitted the offence at the interview conducted by police under caution. Some of the stolen properties were recovered when you pointed them out to police. However, you denied the charge in Court only to be found guilty by the assessors and Court. 
 
 
• The offence of Aggravated Robbery contrary to S.311 (b) of the Crimes Act 2009 carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• The tariff for Aggravated robbery is now well settled. The Court of Appeal in Maya AAU 0053.2011 (27 February, 2015) set the tariff for Aggravated Robbery in the range of 10 to 15 years. The Supreme Court in Wallace Wise CAV 0004 of 2015, (24th April 2015) confirmed that the tariff for Aggravated Robbery to be between 10 and 16 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• The Supreme Court in Wallace Wise (supra) identified factors which should be considered as aggravating. Most of the aggravating features discussed in that case are present in your offending. You committed this offence in a night time home invasion when the victims were leisurely watching television. It was a premeditated attack. You entered the Villa under frightening circumstances, breaking of windows. Some of you were covering the faces. You were armed with offensive weapons. The victims were elderly and vulnerable. You invaded the person and property of your guests who had come to Fiji as tourists, pinning much trust in your hospitality.
 
 
• Your offending has no doubt dealt a severe blow to the economy of this country which is much dependent on hospitality industry. As was indicated in the Victim Impact Statement and evidence, the physical and emotional suffering to the victims is likely to be severe for the rest of their lives. I would quote the sentiments expressed by the victims in the Victim Impact Statement filed in Court.

“Our comfort zone for travelling has changed. Our fear for safety is primary and we have great difficulty planning any vacation. We look at people differently and our care free relaxed attitude has gone. I would like these three men to know that we are not rich people like many others. We had to save to make this trip, a trip I have wanted to take for 40 years. I also would like to think I would be able to one day return to Fiji. Safety while travelling is now a thing of the past. Travel has been reduced to immediate vicinity of our home. I feel we will never be able to afford a travel trip of the scale that Fiji meant for us. A lifetime of dreams diminished by three individuals”
 
  
• These atrocious crimes are prevalent in Fiji and the offenders must be punished to denounce and to send a clear message to the community that no such actions will be tolerated by our society and Courts. Not only the offender but potential offenders must be deterred. Apart from deterrence, the purpose of this sentence is the protection of the community. The offender must be severely punished to ensure safety and security of all innocent people. 
 
 
• You committed the robbery in the course of a joint enterprise and therefore, common sentences will be passed taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence and the harm caused to the victims. Then necessary adjustments to those sentences will be made in respect of each of you taking into account peculiar mitigating circumstances. 
 
 
• In assessing objective seriousness of the offence, I take into consideration the degree of force used, fear instilled, the nature and degree of threats during the invasion and the weapons used to commit the offence. The victims were vulnerable. According to Victim Impact Statement, victims have suffered mentally and physically. 
 
 
• For the offence of Aggravated Robbery, I take a starting point of 10 years and add 2 years for the aggravating features discussed above. The interim sentence for the Aggravated Robbery count for each accused is a term of imprisonment of 12 years.
 
 
• Mr. Pita Natekuru your case is different and more serious. Therefore, I have considered your sentence on a different footing. Although all of you had planned to rob the tourists, you suddenly decided to deviate from the initial plan to exploit the situation in satisfying your lustful demands. You threatened the lady victim and dragged her to the bathroom. Then you inserted your penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse forcibly. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment. 
 
 
• The starting point is seven years’ imprisonment Kasim v The State (Crim App. No. AAU0021 of 1993S) and the tariff is set between 7 and 15 years’ imprisonment (State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338).
 
 
• You used force and exploited the vulnerability of the victim. I pick a starting point of 8 years for the 2nd count of Rape. I add 2 years for aggravating circumstances to reach an interim sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment for the 2nd count of Rape. 

 
  
•  I now look at mitigating circumstances submitted by your counsel for each of you.
 
 
• Mr. Natekuru: You are 24 years old, married and have a child who is 1 year old. You are a farmer and the sole breadwinner of your family. You had been in remand approximately for 1 ½ years. You have two active previous convictions of similar nature. Therefore, you will not get any discount for previous good character. 
 
 
• For mitigating circumstances I deduct 1 for each offence. Now your sentence for 1st count (Aggravated Robbery) is 11 years’ imprisonment. To reflect the remand period, I further deduct 1 ½ years. Now your sentence for Aggravated Robbery is 9 ½ years. For the 2nd count (Rape), I give the same deduction in mitigation to reach a sentence of 8 ½ years’ imprisonment. 
 
 
• You committed the rape in the same transaction as the robbery and the two offences are founded on the same facts. Therefore, having considered the totality principle, I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence in terms of Section 17 of Sentencing and Penalties Act to reflect your offending. Mr. Natekuru, you are accordingly sentenced to an aggregate sentence 15 years’ imprisonment. Having considered your youth, I fix a non- parole period at 12 years’. You are eligible for parole only after serving 12 years in prison.
 
 
• Mr. Nalawa: You are 34 years old, married and have 2 children. Having learnt a lesson from the past, you seek mercy of this Court. You have 2 previous convictions of similar nature. Therefore, no discount is given for your good character. You spent approximately 1 ½ years in remand. I give a deduction of 1 year for mitigation and a further discount of 1½ years to reflect the remand period. Now your final sentence is 9 ½ years’ imprisonment. Mr. Nalawa you are sentenced to 9 ½ years’ imprisonment. Having considered your youth, I fix a non- parole period at 8 years. You are currently serving a prison term. Therefore, I order the sentence imposed in this case to be served concurrently to the existing prison term. 
 
 
• Mr. Fataki: You are 35 years old. You are married and have one child. You are a farmer and the sole breadwinner of the family. You promise not to re-offend and seek mercy of this Court. You do not have active previous convictions. Therefore, I consider you to be a first offender. You have spent nearly 1½ years in remand. I give a deduction of 1½ years for mitigation and a further discount of 1 ½ years to reflect the remand period. Now your final sentence is 9 years’ imprisonment. Having considered your age and rehabilitation potential, I fix a non-parole period at 7 years. 
 

22. Summary
 
 Mr. Pita Natekuru is sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years.
 
 Mr. Laitia Nalawa is sentenced to 9 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years.

28,756,246921,"SENTENCE
 
  
• PAULA RATOGOTOGO , you were charged with one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009 and one count of Criminal Intimidation contrary to section 375(1) (a) (1) (1v) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty this morning and also admitted the summary of facts. According to the facts on after an argument with your wife you punched her face and also threatened to cut her to pieces. 
 
 
• I am satisfied about your plea and convict you for both counts. 
 

The Law and the Tariff 
 
  
• The maximum penalty for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In State vs Anjula Devi Criminal Case No. 4 of 1998 Lab, it was held that the tariff for ""Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm"" ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment or the more serious cases of assault.
 
 
• For the offence of Criminal Intimidation the penalty is 10 years imprisonment and in State V Baleinabodou[2012]FJHC 981 his Lordship Justice Temo said that an accepted tariff would be from 12 months to 04 years . 
 
 
• As for the starting point the UK Sentencing Guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non-domestic context. Therefore the starting point should be same irrespective of whether the parties are known to each other. 
 
 
• Considering the gravity of offending, I select 05 months as the starting point for the 1st count and 14 months for the 2nd count. 
 

Aggravating Factors 
 
  
• In UK Guidelines following are considered as aggravating factors in domestic violence cases: 
  
• Abuse of trust and abuse of power;
 
• Victim is particularly vulnerable;
 
• Impact on children; 
 
• Using contact arrangements with a child to instigate an offence;
 
• A proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting; 
 
•  history of disobedience to court orders; 
 
• Victim forced to leave home .
 

 
• When sentencing for a domestic violence a court in Fiji can consider the above aggravating factors and any other factors that would further aggravate the offence. 
 
 
• In this case I find is the breach of trust and domestic relationship as aggravating these offences and add 03 months to reach 08 months for the 1st count and 17 months for the 2nd count. 
 
 
• As this is a domestic violence offence I have taken in to consideration section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree also. 
 

Mitigating Factors 
 
  
• In UK Guidelines the positive good character and provocation are considered as mitigating factors. In this case for your past good behavior and personal mitigating factors (married with 4 children, sole bread winner) I deduct 02 months to reach 06 months for the 1st count and 15 months for the 2nd count.
 

Guilty Plea 
 
  
• In Naikelekevesi v The State Criminal Appeal No AAU 0061 of 2007 it was observed:
 

""...where there is a guilty plea, this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factors in a case"". 
 
  
• In UK sentencing guidelines of 2007 it has been held that when an accused pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity the reduction is 1/3 and after a trial date is set 1/4 recommended. But when an accused pleaded guilty at the door of the court or after the trial has started he maybe entitle for only 1/10 discount. 
 
 
• For pleading guilty at the first available opportunity I deduct 1/3 to reach 04 months for the 1st count and 10 months for the 2nd count. Considering these were committed in same transaction I order these to be concurrent. 
 
 
• Even though you are a first offender I do not think fully suspending this sentence is appropriate. You not only punched your wife when asked for help but also threatened to cut her to pieces. Your behavior need to be denounced. But considering the hardship that would be faced by your family I would partly suspend this sentence. 
 
 
• Therefore I sentenced you to 03 months imprisonment and remaining 07 months suspended for 03 years. 
 
 
• If you commit any offences during next 03 years you can be charge under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• For the safety of the complainant I also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal

",1,0,1,0,1,sentence,839
29,757,70384,"JUDGMENT
(SENTENCE)

This matter has come before the High Court for sentencing.

The accused appeared before the Resident Magistrate, Labasa on three counts of unnatural offence contrary to section 175(a) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

The Particulars of Offence in the three Counts read as follows:

First Count

SETERO SERU, between the 1st day of December, 2000 to the 23rd day of January, 2001 at Qeleni, Taveuni in the Northern Division had carnal knowledge of JERRY KIKAU against the order of nature.

Second Count

SETERO SERU, between the 1st day of December, 2000 to the 23rd day of January, 2001 at Qeleni, Taveuni in the Northern Division had carnal knowledge of IOKIMI DIGOGO against the order of nature.

Third Count

SETERO SERU, between the 1st day of December, 2000 to the 23rd day of January, 2001 at Qeleni, Taveuni in the Northern Division had carnal knowledge of TOMASI TIKOMAIWAIYEVO against the order of nature.

On his own plea of guilty on each of the three Counts the accused was on 9 August 2001, after the facts as outlined were admitted by him, convicted as charged. The learned Magistrate heard him in mitigation when the accused said: ""Am 26 years old. Farmer. Ask for leniency. Am from Qeleni Village in Taveuni, Single. Live with my parents.""

The learned Magistrate then remanded the accused in custody until 13 August 2001 for sentencing. Thereafter he sent this file to the High Court for sentencing for the reasons appearing hereunder under the provisions of Section 222 of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap. 17:

The accused sodomised these 3 young students on 3 different occasions to satisfy his sexual lust. It is abhorrent to say the least and should be condemned and detested by all right thinking members of Society.

They were cruel and senseless acts on these 3 innocent boys who I am sure will carry these trauma and scars for the rest of their lives.

The penalty for this sort of offence is 14 years imprisonment with or without corporal punishment. My sentencing powers is only up to 5 years imprisonment. The penalty shows the seriousness of these offences.

In my view, even though the accused is a first offender and has pleaded guilty thus saving the indignity of these 3 young boys giving evidence in court, 5 years imprisonment is not enough to sentence this accused to.

I agree with the learned Magistrate that his powers are limited for sentencing purposes bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence. This Court's powers in this situation under section 222 provides:

222. - (1) Where a person, being not less than seventeen years of age, is tried by a resident magistrate for any offence, and such person is convicted by such magistrate of that offence, or of any other offence of which he is liable to conviction under the provisions of this Code then, if, on obtaining information as to his character and antecedents the magistrate is of opinion that they are such that greater punishment should be inflicted in respect of the offence than the magistrate has power to inflict, the magistrate may, in lieu of dealing with him in any manner in which the magistrate has power to deal with him, commit him in custody or on bail to the Supreme Court for sentence in accordance with the following provisions of this section. 

(2) Where the offender is so committed for sentence as aforesaid the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:-

(a) the Supreme Court shall enquire into the circumstances of the case, and shall have power to deal with the offender in any manner in which he could be deal with if he had been convicted by the Supreme Court; and

(b) if dealt with by the Supreme Court the offender shall have the same right of appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal as if he had been convicted and sentenced by the Supreme Court;

(c) the Supreme Court, after hearing counsel for the Crown if he desires to be heard, may remit the accused for sentence, in custody or on bail, to the magistrate which originally committed the accused for sentence, and thereafter the accused shall be dealt with by such court and shall have the same right of appeal as if no such committal to the Supreme Court had been made.
Facts

In considering the appropriate sentence, the facts surrounding each count has to be borne in mind and they are very briefly as hereunder:

Facts on First Count

The victim is a 7 year old student. The accused offered bananas to him and the victim followed the accused to where the bananas were. There the accused told him to remove his pants which he did whereupon the accused 'inserted his erected penis into victim's anus and sodomised him' and ejaculated.

Facts on Second Count

The victim is an 8 year old student to whom he also offered bananas. His modus operandi was the same as in Count 1.

Facts on Third Count

The victim is a 9 year old student who was returning from his dalo plantation. He did the same to this victim as he did in the other two counts. 

These offences were committed between 1 December 2000 and 23 January 2001 but on different dates.

The victims complained of pain as a result of what the accused did to them but he did not pay any heed to it. He threatened to kill them if they reported the matter to anyone.

When the parents came to know of what happened to their children the matter was reported to police. Thereafter the victims were medically examined and their Medical Reports were tendered to Court. The accused was located, interviewed, arrested and charged.

Determination of appropriate sentence

At the outset I must acknowledge the assistance rendered to Court, as amicus curiae, by Mr. J. Rabuku, State Counsel and Ms. Salele, Legal Officer from the Legal Aid Commission by furnishing the Court with authorities.

The accused has no doubt committed a very serious offence on boys aged 7, 8 and 9 years respectively on each of the three counts. The way he enticed these boys to accompany him before he committed the offence shows that it was premeditated and well-planned. Whether he has the propensity to commit this type of offence has not been revealed except that he is a first offender. It was his misfortune to have been caught.

This is a sexual offence and I would place it in almost the same category as the sexual offences of rape and incest. In this case the law provides a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment with or without corporal punishment.

The legislature has indicated the gravity of the offence by the maximum penalties which could be inflicted which will vary primarily with the age of the victims and the degree of coercion.

In deciding on the appropriate sentence in this case, I have borne in mind the factors which ought to be considered, and particularly in recent years the concern of the public for sexual offences committed on very young boys and girls. The Courts are greatly perturbed with the increase in such offences in recent past. It seems that sentences meted out so far do not appear to have any effect on would-be offenders. The non-governmental organisations are up in arms and rightly so on recent increase in such offences with the Courts sentences not having the desired effect on offenders. I would like to point out to the public at large, and to anyone minded to commit offences of the kind before me and like offences, the total unacceptability of such conduct towards children.

In my four and a half decade in the law in Fiji the situation in the area of sexual offences, which has dramatically increased, has never been as bad or worse as it is now. I feel that the time is now opportune for the Courts to lay down a guideline for the minimum sentence for an offence of the nature such as the one before me. The learned Magistrate, Labasa Mr. Maika Nakora is to be commended for referring the case for sentencing to the High Court for as is evident from his remarks referred to hereabove his 5 years jurisdiction is not enough and I agree.

With those remarks I would like to refer to the following passage from the report of Wolfenden Committee in 1957 on the function of the criminal law in the field of sexual offences which is apt in the context of this case:

""To preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive and injurious and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others, particularly those who are specially vulnerable because they are young, weak in body or mind, inexperienced or in a state of special physical, official or economic dependence."" (emphasis mine)

In considering the sentence in a case such as this, the matters which had to be considered as stated in the incest case of Wilfred James Corless [(1989) 11 Cr. App. R.(S) C. A. 47 at 48, Lord Lane C.J.] are various. Firstly the ages of the boys: in this case they are 7, 8 and 9 years old respectively; they are very young. Secondly, the length of time over which this offence was committed: in this case over a period of six weeks. Was there any violence - the effect on the boys: it must affect their chances of being able to have a contented and satisfactory adult life particularly with regard to sex. His previous record: there is no record at all of crime against the accused. Finally, what was the plea: that perhaps in this case is the one mitigating feature; there was a plea of guilty here which no doubt saved the boys from further trauma if they had to give evidence as the learned Magistrate also stated. Plea of guilty, which is a mitigating feature, it should be met by an appropriate discount, depending on usual considerations, namely how promptly the accused confessed and his degree of contrition and so on, [Attorney-General's Reference (No. 1 of 1989) (1989) 11 Cr. App. R.(S) C.A. 409 at 414).

Apart from the factors outlined above, it has been stated further in Stephen John Peter Jones [(1991) 92 Cr. App. R. 288 C.A. Lord Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Kennedy] (which dealt with sentence in sexual attacks against young children and setting out guidelines on aspects to be taken into account) that:

""There are certainly five aspects which a sentencing judge, and in this position this Court, has to take into consideration when determining the correct sentence for this type of offence: first of all the overall gravity of the offence; secondly, the necessity for punishment of the offender, something which is sometimes over-looked; thirdly, the necessity to protect the public from the activities of someone who is prepared to sniff solvent and then, having his sexual inclinations aroused, goes and commits this type of offence; fourthly, the public concern at sexual offences on young children; and fifthly what one hopes may be the deterrent effect, the effect which a severe sentence may have upon other people who might be minded to act in this way"". (emphasis mine)

Again on the question of appropriate sentence I have been guided by the following passage from the judgment of Burt C.J. in Bensegger v R Supreme Court W.A. C.C.A. [1979] WAR 65 at 68.

""A maximum sentence prescribed by statute is not reserved for the worst offence of the kind dealt with by it that can be imagined. If such were the case it could never be imposed as the addition of further non-existing but aggravating circumstances would never be beyond the reach of imagination. The true rule as I understand it is that the maximum sentence should be reserved for the worst type of case falling within the prohibition or, as it is expressed by Dwyer CJ in Reynolds v Wilkinson (1948) 51 WALR 17, at 18, ""for the worst cases of the sort"". That expression should be understood to be marking out a range and an offence may be within it notwithstanding the fact that it could have been worse than it was. In my opinion, on the facts as appearing in the trial judge's report to this court these offences, and particularly the smuggling offence, can each fairly be said to be of the worst type and notwithstanding the fact that it was the applicant's first offence ""of the sort"" and notwithstanding the antedecents and personal history of the applicant which, as the trial judge points out, are not without blemish they called for the imposition of the maximum custodial sentence.""

In Archbold - Pleading Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases (1992) in Chapter 20 under the caption 'Sexual Offences' in section X1 'Unnatural Offences' is dealt with at para 20-154 which in United Kingdom comprises of 'Buggery', 'Indecent Assault on a man' and 'Gross Indecency'. The one akin to the offence of 'unnatural offence' in our Penal Code is called 'buggery'.

After reading a number of English cases and the sentences passed in them, I find that there are not sufficient guidelines to assist us in the context of situation in Fiji. Archbold (ibid, 20 - 166) under 'sentencing guidelines' refers to R v Willis (1974) 60 Cr. Appl R.146 where it is stated that 'the bracket of sentencing in cases of homosexual offences against boys with neither aggravating or mitigating factors ... as being three to five years and has not been lowered by subsequent cases [R v White (1990) 12 Cr. App. R. (S) 30]' Sentencing in Willis (supra) is not of much assistance in this case as far as the sentence is concerned for there are aggravating factors in the present case and these have to be seriously considered. The victims are of tender age, very vulnerable, subjected to such degrading behaviour and allowed to endure the pain to which no attention was paid by the accused and worst of all threatened to be killed if they reported. The accused was in a position of responsibility towards these child victims in the Fijian Village context where the offence took place. The effect on the victims does not require further elucidation. 

A person indulging in this animal-like behaviour has to be put away from society for a long time as a deterrent to others minded to act in the manner the accused did. No one would like to see his/her child suffer such indignity and one only has to put oneself in the position of these victims (children) to realize what they must have gone through at the hands of the accused.

In dealing with the question of appropriate sentence I think I ought to refer to the case of Attorney-General's Reference No. 7 of 1997 (Robert Fearon) [1998] 1 Cr.App. R. (S) C.A. 268 which is a case of buggery of young boys over an extended period and it dealt with adequacy of sentence. There Lord Bingham C.J. referred to cases cited by counsel on sentences and I think they are worth bearing in mind for the purposes of this case. He said:

""He has drawn our attention to a series of cases, including Liddle (1985) 7 Cr. App. R. (S.) 59, in which on a plea of guilty a sentence of 10 years imprisonment was upheld; Hutichson (1988) 10 Cr. App. R. (S.) 50, in which on a plea of guilty a sentence of 14 years imprisonment was reduced to 10; Pearce (1988) 10 Cr. App. R. (S.) 331, in which a sentence of eight years imprisonment on a plea of guilty was upheld; Attorney-General's Reference No. 4 of 1993 (Bingham) (1994) 15 Cr. App. R. (S.) 205, in which on a plea of guilty a sentence of three years imprisonment was increased to five in reliance on section 2(2)(b) of the 1991 Act; and Attorney-General's Reference No. 9 of 1994 (Groves)(1995) 16 Cr. App. R. (S.) 366 in which on a plea of guilty a sentence of six years imprisonment was increased to nine.

In response, counsel for the offender has referred to additional cases. She has drawn our attention to Willis (1974) 60 Cr. App. R. 146, in which a sentence of five years imprisonment on a plea of guilty was upheld; to Attorney-General's Reference No. 43 of 1994 (Smith) 1995) 16 Cr. App. R. (S.) 815, in which a sentence of three-and-a-half years imprisonment was increased to seven years on a plea of guilty; to Attorney-General's Reference No. 9 of 1996 (Johnson) [1997] 1 Cr. App. R. (S.) 113, in which a sentence of eight years' imprisonment was increased to 11 on a plea of guilty, the Court relying on section 2(2)(b) of the 1991 Act; and finally, to Simpson (1981) 3 Cr. App. R.(S.) 345, in which on a plea of guilty a sentence of nine years imprisonment was redued to seven.

As far as the two local cases are concerned, which were referred to by Mr. Rabuku, I have not lost sight of them. The cases are Viliame Karawa v State (Labasa Crim. App. No. 10 of 1990, Fatiaki J) and Iosefo Lutuvou v State (Labasa Crim. App. No. 1/2001, Pathik J). 

In sentencing in this case, the Court has to give sufficient credit for confessing at an early stage and pleading guilty. There are no other mitigating features as I can see The boys were 7, 8 and 9 years of age when the offence took place, thus in my view, bearing in mind the gravity of the offence and other matters I have indicated a starting point of not less than 7 years imprisonment is appropriate for the offence on children up to 12 years of age.

The accused was convicted on 9 August 2001 and has been and still is in custody since and in imposing an appropriate sentence his time in custody i.e. eight and a half months will be taken into account. He is sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years on each count. The sentences will run concurrently, one with the other. The total effect will be therefore that the accused will have to serve a sentence of 6 years from now on after having been given credit for the time spent in custody.

	1.	You stood charged for committing the offences of 'Sexual Assault' punishable under Section 210 (1) (a) read with sub-section (2); and, 'Rape' punishable under Section 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009 in Count Nos. (1) and (2) of the information respectively. You pleaded guilty to the 1st count, while maintaining a plea of 'not guilty' in respect of the 2nd count. Court accepted your guilty plea to the 1st count and fixed the matter relating to the 2nd count for trial.

	2.	Summary of facts, as submitted by the state, was accepted by you. 

	3.	Facts reveal that the victim was a girl of 7 years, who stood in relationship to you as daughter. You were 47 years old when you sexually invaded the victim on unspecified dates between 01 January 2011 and 24 April 2012. 

	4.	It appears that you had taken the victim to a creek more than once under the pretext of fishing, made her lie and got her legs spread-out for you to lick her genitalia. You kept on doing the misdeed for some time. The matter was reported to police in April 2012 as the victim narrated the story to one of her cousins, who in turn told the mother of the victim.

	5.	'Sexual Assault' is a serious offence, which is punishable with a term of 14 years under Section 210 (2) of the Crimes Decree, when the acts complained of involve any form of contact with genitalia. Facts, admitted by you, fit into this description of the offence.

	6.	The sentence for the offence, as considered by case precedents in State v Tuwai [2011] FJHC 287, State v Rainima [2012] FJHC 945 and Sikeli Nayata v State HAA 46/2008, ranges from 1-4 years.

	7.	Having regard to the facts of the case, I commence your sentence at the higher level of 3 years. I consider your relationship to the victim as the father as a ground for aggravating the offending. I, accordingly, enhance the sentence by two years to take into account the form of aggravation, which indeed was a breach of morality. The offence was repeatedly committed in stealth under pretexts having taken the victim away from other members of the family. This, too, constitutes a form of aggravation for which I add two more years to reflect in the sentence and reach 7 (seven) years.

	8.	There are obviously no circumstances to mitigate the offence. 

	9.	However, I am inclined to give credit to your early guilty plea, which, in a sense is a display of true remorse. Your early guilty plea saved the victim from the ordeal of narrating her bitter experience in court at least partially. Accordingly, I reduce the sentence by 28 months.

	10.	Your past record is not free from violence as you had been dealt with by court from time to time from 1984-2009 for a variety of crimes, which, however, does not show any sexual offences. You are not entitled to any discount in the circumstances for your past record.

	11.	You have been on remand from 30 April 2012 to date spanning a period of almost ten months. I reduce a period of 8 months to set-off a substantial amount of your detention on remand.

	12.	Your sentence, accordingly, would be a term of 4 (four) year imprisonment. Acting under Section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose a non-parole period of 3 (three) years.

This court shall explore the legal boundaries of this application before moving on to decide a suitable sentence on you.
 
 
The application not to record a conviction is based on the provisions of section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

Section 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree:
 
 
(1) If a court finds a person guilty of an offence, it may, subject to any specific provision relating to the offence, and subject to the provisions of this Decree-
 
 
(a) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment;
 
 
(b) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment partly in custody and partly in the community;
 
 
(c) record a conviction and make a drug treatment order in accordance with regulations made under section 30;
 
 
(d) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment that is wholly or partly suspended;
 
 
(e) with or without recording a conviction, make an order for community work to be undertaken in accordance with the Community Work Act 1994 or for a probation order under the Probation of Offenders Act [Cap. 22];
 
 
(f) with or without recording a conviction, order the offender to pay a fine;
 
 
(g) record a conviction and order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court;
 
 
(h) record a conviction and order the discharge of the offender;
 
 
(i} without recording a conviction, order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court;
 
 
(j} without recording a conviction, order the dismissal of the charge; or
 
 
(k} impose any other sentence or make any other order that is authorized under this Decree or any other Act.
 
 
(Sub-Sec. 2-5 not relevant for the purpose)
 
 
Section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree:
 
 
(1} In exercising its discretion whether or not to record a conviction, a court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including­
 
 
(a) the nature of the offence;
 
 
(b) the character and past history of the offender; and
 
 
(c) the impact of a conviction on the offender's economic or social well-being, and on his or her employment prospects. (Sub-Sec.2 & 3 not relevant)
 
 
6. It is clear from the above two sections that not recording a conviction would limit the range of sentencing orders a court can make and as such shall be sparingly exercised. Thus it cannot be said that at any instance a court finds a ground under section 16 is satisfied a conviction should not be recorded. Certainly there should be a criteria to exercise the discretion of the court not to record a conviction largely owing, in my view, to the nature and seriousness of a charge among many other considerations.
 
 
As the counsel for the State has correctly highlighted the case of Botaki v State [2012]
 
 
FJHC 1250; HAA015.2012 (1 August 2012) clearly highlights these considerations.
 
 
In this case Hon. Justice P. Madigan held thus;
 
 
""The operative word in this section is //discretion11
 
 
Just because an offender will lose his job/ and just because he will be affected economically does not mean that it is mandatory for a Magistrate to invoke the provisions of this Section. Where a Magistrate has exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power, that it would be in a very exceptional circumstances that an appellate court would interfere with that exercise.
 
 
8. This is particularly so in cases of Domestic Violence which this case is. The Domestic Violence Decree is clearly a Decree which aims to provide greater protection from Domestic Violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not record a conviction against a perpetrator.
 
 
9. The appellant has pleaded guilty to the offence and admits facts which go to the elements of the offence. The fact that he holds a career position as a Vice Principal is of no moment. This Court treats perpetrators alike be they poor or rich/ of high or lowly status.
 
 
10. The appeal against conviction is dismissed.//
 
 
In the highest sense of clarity the High Court of Fiji has ruled out 'domestic violence offences' from the range of offences a court can act without recording a conviction. Thus your plea for not to record a conviction is hereby refused and accordingly the conviction is recorded.
 
 
7. I now turn to decide a suitable sentence on you. I shall consider the appropriate sentence on you under the general principles and guidelines on sentencing and range of sentencing orders as set out in Sections 04 and 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 in line with the objectives thereof. I shall further give special attention to Section 4 (3) of the Decree which reads as follows;
(3) In sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence, a court must also have regard to -
 
 
(a) any special considerations relating to the physical, psychological or other characteristics of a victim of the offence, including-
 
 
(i) the age of the victim;
 
 
(ii) whether the victim was pregnant; and
 
 
(iii) whether the victim suffered any disability;
 
 
(b) whether a child or children were present when the offence was committed, or were otherwise affected by it;
 
 
(c) the effect of the violence on the emotional, psychological and physical well-being of a victim;
 
 
(d) the effect of the offence in terms of hardship, dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim;
 
 
(e) the conduct of the offender towards the victim since the offence, and any matter which indicates whether the offender –
 
 
(i) accepts responsibility for the offence and its consequences;
 
 
(ii) has taken steps to make amends to a victim, including action to minimize or address the negative impacts of the offence on a victim;
 
 
(iii) may pose any further threat to a victim;
 
 
(f) evidence revealing the offender's - (i) attitude to the offence;
 
 
(ii) intention to address the offending behaviour; and
 
 
(iii) likelihood of continuing to pose a threat to a victim; and
 
 
{g) whether the offender has sought and received counseling or other assistance to address the offending behaviour, or is willing to undertake such counseling or seek such assistance.
 
 
8. Having said that, I shall now explore the prescribed penalty and the tariff for this offence.
The maximum punishment for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm is 05 years of imprisonment.
 
 
The tariff for this offence; ""...ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 09 months imprisonment for the more serious case of assault"" State v Anjula Devi (Criminal Case No. 04 of 1998 lab) as cited with approval by Hon. Justice Goundar in Sereka v State (2008) FJHC 88, HAA027.2008
{25 April 2008). Hon. Justice Madigan held in State v Sikitora (2010) FJHC 466;
 
 
HAC067.2010l{22 October 2010) that ""The cases of Elizabeth Joseph v State {2004) HAA 03 of 2004 and State v Tevita Alati (2004) HAA 73 of 2004 establish a tariff 09 months to 12 months imprisonment, the severity of the wound being the determining factor in the starting point. However, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld in Domestic Violence cases Amasi Korovata v State {2006) HA 115 of 2006"".
 
 
9. As per the facts, I do not conclude that this incident was unprovoked. Further there are no weapons used in the commission of the offence. However the injuries on the Complainant appear to be moderate as per the medical report. As per above facts and circumstances I conclude that this offence warrants a prison term and accordingly selects 09 months imprisonment as the starting point.
 
 
The fact that you have seriously breached the trust reposed on you by the Complainant as her husband and the fact that by assaulting her in public reflected cruel and degrading treatment towards the Complainant clearly aggravates the offence.
 
 
To reflect upon the aggravating factors I add 10 months to your sentence bringing your sentence up to 19 months.
 
 
10. I now consider the facts in mitigation.
 
 
• You are a young first offender and a well-respected police officer amongst your superior officers having a 10 year service history.
 
• You express remorse and promise not to reoffend.
 
 
• You have a family with a young child that you financially support.
 
 
• You have pleaded guilty to the offence saving time and resources of court and the state.
 
 
To reflect the mitigating factors (except for the early guilty plea) I discount your sentence by 04 months and the guilty plea is separately discounted for by a further 05 months.
Thus the final sentence on you for the offence of 'Assault occasioning Actual Bodily harm' is 10 months imprisonment.
 
 
11. Having in mind the provisions of Sec.26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I do concede that this court has the power to suspend your sentence since it is less than 02 years of imprisonment.
 
 
12. Directing my mind on the guideline cases on suspension of sentences; DPP v Jolame Pita (1974) 20 FLR 5 and more recently DPP v Saviriano Radovu (1996) 42 FLR 76 and Deo v State (2005) FJCA 62, I shall consider whether there are any special circumstances to justify a suspension of your sentence.
 
 
13. Upon the above line of authorities I find the following facts to exist in this case.
 
 
• Conduct on the part of the Complainant partially provoking the incident.
 
 
• No serious or permanent physical injuries caused to the Complainant.
 
 
• Being a person of good character having a clear criminal record for the past 33 years.
 
 
• No weapons used in the commission of the offence.
 
 
• No evidence of continuous violence towards the Complainant.
 
 
• No evidence of past history of domestic violence.
 
 
14. Accordingly, I am of the view that you should be availed of another opportunity to rehabilitate in the main stream without getting mixed with hardened criminals within the four corners of a prison cell. In the interest of justice, I am therefore satisfied that above factors are to be considered special circumstances justifying a suspension of your sentence.
 
 
15. You are therefore explained of the scope and effect of a suspended sentence and further the consequences that would follow if you commit another offence during the period of suspension.
 
 
Having explained the same, I now proceed to suspend your sentence for a period of 03 years.
 
 
16. In the final outcome, your sentence is 10 months imprisonment term suspended for 03 years.
 
 
17. Further to your imprisonment term, considering the fact that this offence is one of domestic violence, I further make the Interim DVRO; issued against you on the 30th April 2014, on standard non molestation condition, a final Domestic Violence Restraining Order, pursuant to sec.24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Decree. This Domestic Violence Restraining Order shall be in force until and unless varied or suspended by a competent court. Breach of this order shall result in you being charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant to sec.77 of the Domestic Violence Decree.
 
 
18. You have 28 days to Appeal.
 
 
Kashyapa Wickramasekara,
 
 
26/02/2015 Resident Magistrate.

32,760,70803,"SENTENCE

[1] Albertino Shankar and Francis Narayan you have been found guilty by the court of the offence of murder. The sentence fixed by law for such an offence is that the convicted person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. There is no discretion allowed to the court in a murder case to sentence to a lesser term.

[2] It is well known that convicted persons sentenced to life imprisonment usually do not serve the full term, that is serve imprisonment for the rest of their lives. Most have their sentences reduced after serving a considerable term such as 10 or 12 years.

[3] In this case I had called for submissions from counsel on whether I should recommend a minimum period to be served under the provisions of section 33 of the Penal Code. 

[4] Ms Narayan, submitting for both prisoners, informs me that the actual period of imprisonment is usually 14 years, but that the latter part is allowed to be served in the community outside of the prison walls.

[5] It is significant here that the prisoners were very young when they committed this offence. Albertino was aged 17 years 9 months. He is now 20. Francis was aged 21 at the time, and he is now 23. I keep in mind their youth.

[6] They are not from well off homes. They did not get far with their education. Albertino appears to have drifted between a home with his single mother and a home with his elderly grandfather. Francis’ home appears more stable, yet he got involved in an offence of bulk store breaking in 1999 and served a term of imprisonment of 9 months. Albertino has not previously been before the courts.

[7] Both have had casual work, but nothing of permanence or promise.

[8] Neither has shown any remorse for what they have done. Both maintain their innocence. But both were emotionally moved when asked if they had anything to say prior to sentence and in addressing the court.

[9] Mr Rabuku has made no submissions on behalf of the State on the question of whether there should be a recommendation of minimum service. Ms Narayan says the recommendation should be of 5 years only, since they have been on remand now for 2 years 3 months, equivalent to a full term of 3 years 9 months.

[10] I take that period of remand into account when arriving at the appropriate order. 

[11] This was, as I said in summing up the case, a truly dreadful crime. A 34 year old Chinese lady, a Ms Tang, living alone in a flat awakens to find two men entering through her bedroom window after midnight.

[12] According to the Accused, their plan was to steal from Ms Tang. They did eventually do just that, and this might have remained a case of house breaking. But the two Accused, commencing with Albertino, then raped Ms Tang. Francis followed after and raped her also. Each Accused raped her for a second time whilst they remained in the flat. They are not charged with rape, but I take what they said they did into account as an aggravating feature of this murder case.

[13] But to avoid any struggling and any chance of Ms Tang shouting out for help, before each raped her a second time, they taped her ankles with scotch tape or masking tape and bound up most of her face with tape, and tied her hands behind her back with wire.

[14] All of this account comes from the prisoners’ own admissions made to the police. The Accused then discussed in front of Ms Tang what they were going to do with her. Though there was some initial reluctance on the part of Francis, both agreed eventually that she would have to be killed because she would recognise them again. It is likely she knew Albertino as a person who lived downstairs at the same block of flats.

[15] Albertino brought a piece of rope from another room wound it several times around the victim’s neck, and strangled her. Francis held her legs. She struggled, until she ceased breathing and died.

[16] Just prior to the strangling, no doubt realising what the 2 Accused were deciding to do with her, Ms Tang kept pleading with them ""I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die."" It is not difficult to imagine the horrific ordeal that faced the victim in her final moments.

[17] Her life was taken with hardly a thought, ruthlessly, callously.

[18] The defence at one point appeared to hint at responsibility for the crime lying with one of Ms Tang’s friends.

[19] The inhabitants of Fiji must be made to feel secure in their homes. They should be able ""to sleep easily"", to feel secure. Housebreakers are to be deterred or at least punished. Housebreakers who go on to commit rape on the occupants, need even more severe punishment. To those who having committed those two serious crimes, go on to destroy the evidence, and to murder the occupants can expect no mercy from the courts. The courts have a duty to inflict condign punishment.

[20] But I have arrived at a recommendation for a minimum term to be served that will not destroy your lives. It will allow some hope for a fresh start when you are released. It is to be hoped that when that time comes you will indeed be able to start afresh and to make something of your lives.

[21] Accordingly you are both sentenced to life imprisonment and I recommend that you each serve a minimum term of 17 years imprisonment.

Orders accordingly.

	2.	The facts were disturbing. When everyone was out of your house at Reba Circle, Nadera, on 19th February 2011, between 9 am and 10 am and thereabout, you set your wife on fire. This was after a heated domestic argument. Your wife took herself to CWM Hospital, suffering from ""first degree burns to 40% of her body"". Five days later on 24th February 2011, she passed away. You certainly did a conduct (ie. burning your wife), which conduct lead to her death, as a result of severe burn injuries (conduct caused death), and at the time, you intended to cause her death (intent to kill). 

	3.	In State v Seremaia Naidole Momo, HAC 086 of 2011S, High Court, Suva, I said the following, ""...""Murder"" is a serious offence, and it is often said, to be at the top of the criminal calendar. It carries a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment. (Section 237, Crime Decree 2009). The court has the power to fix a non-parole period to be served, before a prisoner is eligible for parole. Case precedents show that the non-parole period for murder varies widely, depending on the peculiar facts of the case. In Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji, on 5 counts of murder and 1 of attempted murder, the accused was given 19 years non–parole period on each murder count, and 10 years consecutive on a pending prison sentence, total non-parole period was 26 years. In State v Niume & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 010 of 2010, High Court, Suva, on 2 counts of murder, Accused No. 1 was given 25 years non-parole period for the murder counts. In State v Ashwin Chand, Criminal Case No. HAC 032 of 2005, High Court, Lautoka, on a count of murder, the accused was given a non-parole period of 22 years. In State v Navau Lebobo, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2002, High Court, Suva, the non-parole period was 20 years. Twenty years non-parole period were also imposed in the following three cases: State v Anesh Ram, Criminal Case No. HAC 124 of 2008S, High Court, Suva; State v Bharat Lal & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 061 of 2009S, High Court, Suva, and The State v Salesi Balekivuya, Criminal Case No. 095 of 2010S, High Court, Suva. In State v Tukana, Criminal Case No. HAC 021 of 2009, High Court, Lautoka, the non-parole period was 11 years. The non-parole period imposed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors...""

	4.	The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows:
		(i) You have unnecessarily terminated the life of a young lady, aged 26 years at the time;

		(ii) You had no justifiable reason whatsoever to take the life of your wife;

		(iii) You planned to carry out your evil deeds when your mother and sister left the house;

		(iv) Your method of killing showed an utter disregard for human life;

		(v) By your criminal action, you have caused untold heart ache and sadness to the parents of the deceased, including her sister and relatives;

		(vi) Throughout the proceeding, you showed no remorse.

	5.	The mitigation factors, were as follows:
		(i) At the age of 32 years, this is your first offence;

		(ii) You have a previous good work record;

		(iii) You had been remanded in custody for approximately 35 days.

	6.	For murdering your wife on 19th February 2011, I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment.

	7.	For the non-parole period, I start with 16 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 21 years. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 18 years imprisonment.

	8.	In summary, I sentence you to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 18 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.

• Nitendra Prasad Bilash, you were charged with the following offence;

Statement of offence
 
Rape: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2)(b) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
Particulars of offence
 
NITENDRA PRASAD BILASH on the 22nd day of July 2013, at Nabua, in the Central Division penetrated the vagina of Achal Prasad with his fingers without her consent.
 
  
• After trial, the assessors returned with a unanimous opinion that you arenot guilty of the above offence. Upon considering the summing up and the evidence adduced during trial, this court decided not to conform to the opinion of the assessors and found you guilty of rape as charged and convicted you accordingly.
 
 
• In brief, the victim who was 16 years oldcame to your house on 22/07/2013 to lookafter your daughter, on your request. Victim’s father used to cut grass in your compound and her mother used to do house work. On the aforementioned date, after you returned from work and while your daughter was taking a shower, you sat next to the victim, removed her pants and the underwear and penetrated the victim’s vagina with your fingers without her consent. As a result, victim’s hymen was ruptured. At the time of the offence you were 38 years old.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of a child victim is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• I take 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence.
 
 
• Victim’s parents used to work for you.You were known to the victim and her family. You had power and control over the victim and her family as they earned their bread and butter by working for you. Both the victim and her mother had their trust in you. On the day in question the victim who was 16 years old at that time came to babysit your daughter who was 10 years old, on your request. You were responsible for the victim’s care and protection during the time material to this case as the victim was at your house looking after your daughter. You seized the opportunity when your daughter was taking a shower, to rape the complainant who was also a child just 6 years older than your daughter.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• breach of trust;
 
• you had authority over the victim who was vulnerable at the material time; and
 
• the age gap between you and the victim which is 22 years.
 

 
• Your counsel says that you cooperated with the police during investigation and at the time of arrest. However according to the evidence of the 4th prosecution witness who was the investigating officer, he had cooperated with you as he mentioned that one reason for the delay in conducting your cautioned interview was that he gave you time as you were working at the Suva City Council.
 
 
• Your counsel also says that you have a 13 year old daughter and your family depends on you, that you are supporting your mother who is 63 years old, you are a person of good character who is respected in the neighbourhood, you have served the Suva City Council for 13 years with a good employment record and that you have no previous convictions.
 
 
• I consider the following as mitigating factors;  
• you have no previous convictions;
 
• your unblemished service for 13 years to the public;
 
• you support your 63 year old mother; and
 
• you are41years old, married with one daughter;
 

 
• Considering the aggravating factors, I add 4 years to the starting point and deduct 4 years considering the mitigating factors.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to 10 years imprisonment.In terms of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole till you serve08 years of that sentence.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree 2009 reads thus;

“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• You were arrested with regard to this matter on 13/05/2014. You were granted bail on 29/05/2014. Accordingly, you have spent a total period of 16days in custody. This period of 16days shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you in respect of the sentence imposed on you this day.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 08 years. Considering the time spent in custody, the remaining period to be served is;

Head Sentence – 09 years, 11 months and 14 days
 
Non-parole period – 07 years, 11 months and 14 days
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

	1.	Kameli Koro you pleaded guilty to the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

	2.	You admitted that you were not forced to plead guilty to the charge and that you pleaded voluntarily. You also accepted the facts tendered by prosecution. 

	3.	The Court after being satisfied that your guilty plea was unequivocal convicted you as charged.

	4.	The facts are on 31/3/13 at 8.30am at Naisogovau Settlement Nalawa Ra you had an argument with your wife the complainant (Ilisapeci Rota, 31yrs) for not allowing your wife to attend a village fundraising. During the process of the heated argument you got angry and slapped the complainant on her face. 

The matter was reported to police. You were arrested, cautioned interviewed and then charged accordingly.

The complainant was also taken to the hospital for medical examination. The medical report shows injuries consistent with the allegation.

	1.	Ms Tarai mitigated and I take the following in your favour:
	◦	You've a first offender;
	◦	Pleaded guilty at first available opportunity;
	◦	You've reconciled with the complainant and remorseful;
	◦	You promised not to re-offend and requested for leniency.

	2.	I consider the aggravating features in this case as:
	◦	No provocation by the complainant;
	◦	Breach of trust.

	3.	It should be noted that due to your relationship with the complainant the subject offence is regarded as a domestic violence offence. 

	4.	Under the Crimes Decree no. 44 of 2009, the prescribed penalty for Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm under section 275 is a maximum imprisonment term of 5 years. 

	5.	The tariff for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment (see: State v Salote Tugalala, HAC025 of 2008). The High Court in Elizabeth Joseph v. The State [2004] HAA 030/04S and State v. Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA073/04S stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence....Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases, sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld (Amasai Korovata v. The State [2006] HAA 115/06S).

	6.	In light of the circumstances of offending in this case, I commence my sentence at 9 months imprisonment.

	7.	For the aggravating factors I increase the sentence by 2 months. Your sentence stands at 11 months.

	8.	This being your first offence and other mitigation I reduce the sentence by 2 months. For your guilty plea I further deduct the sentence by 3 months. Your final sentence is 6 months imprisonment. 

	9.	To give effect to the principle of deterrence you are sentenced to 6 months imprisonment.

	10.	I now consider whether your sentence should be suspended. Although the nature of the offending was unprovoked, you have a good background hence it would be appropriate to suspend your sentence. 

	11.	I order that your sentence of 6 months imprisonment be suspended for 2 years. If you commit any offence within the operational period of 2 years, you'll be charged for breaching this suspension order and if convicted you'll be made to serve this 6 months imprisonment term or part of it with any other punishment imposed in that other offence.

	12.	In addition to the above, I also make an order under section 27(2) of the Domestic Violence Decree that you must not:
	i.	physically assault or sexually assault Ilisapeci Rota;
	ii.	threaten to physically assault or sexually assault Ilisapeci Rota;
	iii.	damage or threaten to damage any property of Ilisapeci Rota;
	iv.	threaten, intimidate or harass Ilisapeci Rota;
	v.	behave in an abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards Ilisapeci Rota;
	vi.	encourage any person to engage in behaviour against Ilisapeci Rota where the behaviour if engaged in by you would be prohibited by the order. 

	13.	This Domestic Violence Restraining Order can only be varied, suspended or discharged by further orders of the Court.

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1)(2)(c) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
SIMELI BILI NAISUA on the 5th day of April 2010, at Lami, in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of S.M with his penis without her consent.

	1.	The accused pleaded not guilty, and the matter was heard. On 16th December, 2010, His Lordship Mr. Justice S. Thurairaja delivered his summing up. The assessors then retired to deliberate. They returned with a unanimous verdict that the accused was guilty as charged. His Lordship agreed with the assessors, found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. On 8th February, 2011, the accused was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment.

	2.	The accused was aggrieved by the above decision, and he lodged his appeal against conviction and sentence on 1st March 2011. His ground of appeal on conviction were as follows:
		(i) That he was convicted of a defective charge, which should be under section 207(2), instead of subsection 1 of the Crimes Decree 2009;

		(ii) The Learned Trial Judge failed to call the arresting officer at the voir dire to determine the admissibility of the confession. I feel the time of arrest and the time of my being taken to court is accountable to the time of interview. The same was not considered by the court;

		(iii) The complainant's allegation of rape is not true;

		(iv) The allegation by the complainant was sexual assault, not rape.

	3.	On sentence, the appellant complained the sentence was harsh and excessive.

	4.	The appellant's right to appeal to the Court of Appeal is governed by section 21(1) of the of the Court of Appeal Act, Chapter 12, which reads as follows:

""...21(1) A person convicted on a trial held before the High Court may appeal under this Part to the Court of Appeal –

(a) against his conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone;

(b) with the leave of the Court of Appeal or upon the certificate of the judge who tried him that it is a fit case for appeal against his conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact or any other ground which appears to the Court to be a sufficient ground of appeal; and 

(c) with the leave of the Court of Appeal against the sentence passed on his conviction unless the sentence is one fixed by law...""

	1.	Both parties have submitted written submission, and I have carefully considered the same. I have also listened to their verbal submissions.

	2.	The appellant was convicted on 16th December 2010. He submitted his appeal within time. However, he must satisfy the requirements of section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act, Chapter 12, to proceed with his appeal on conviction. He must satisfy the court that his ground of appeal on conviction ""involves a question of law alone"". According to the State, the appellant's ground of appeal against conviction does not involve question of law alone, and as such, ask that his appeal against conviction be dismissed. I have carefully looked at the grounds submitted by the appellant, and I must say, I agree with the State. The appellant was correctly charged. It is not the role of the trial judge to call for witnesses in a voir dire. The assessors and the court have properly made their decision on the charge. The grounds submitted by the appellant does not involve questions of law.

	3.	As to the sentence, the appellant had not shown that the sentence was wrong in law.

	4.	Pursuant to section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act, Chapter 12, I find the appellant's appeal against conviction is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal, and his application for leave to appeal against sentence is nothing but vexations and frivolous. I therefore dismiss his appeal against conviction and sentence.

Calanchini P 
 
 
[1] I agree that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed and that the appeal against sentence be allowed in terms proposed by Waidyaratne JA.
 
 
Waidyaratne JA
 
 
[2] This is an appeal against the conviction and sentence.
 
 
[3] The Appellant was charged before the Magistrate Court at Tavua for committing an offence of rape contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap. 17. 
 
 
[4] The particulars of offence were that the Appellant on the 25th of September 2006, at Tavua in the Western Division; committed the offence of rape on Sovaia Tei.
 
 
[5] On the 18th April 2012, the Appellant was found guilty and convicted as charged on the count of rape.
 
 
[6] Thereafter the Learned Magistrate transferred the case for sentencing to the Lautoka High Court.
 
 
[7] On the 19th March 2013 the Appellant was sentenced by the Lautoka High Court to a term of 18 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 16 years.
 
 
[8] The Appellant made an application for leave to appeal against the conviction and sentence.
 
 
[9] On the 12th March 2015, the Appellant filed amended grounds of appeal against conviction and sentence which raised three main grounds of appeal.
 
 
 
The grounds of appeal are as follows:
 
  
• that the Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact when he did not consider in his judgment the serious doubt that arose from the admission of the complainant under cross examination of State witness relating to this allegation.
 
• the Learned Sentencing Judge erred in law when he gave a sentence that was outside of the accepted tariff.
 
 
• the Learned Sentencing Judge erred in law when he did not separately deduct the 3 months remand period from the total sentence after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors.
 

When this matter was taken up for argument on the 12th March 2015, the counsel for the Appellant in his submissions raised two additional grounds of appeal:
 
  
• That the evidence of the complainant under cross-examination suggested that there was only an attempt to rape and that it was only in re-examination that she had stated that the Appellant had intercourse with her without her consent.
 
• That the medical evidence led in this case raised doubts as to whether there was recent penetration at the time the complainant was medically examined.
 

[10] On the 1st May 2015, a Single Judge of the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal on the above grounds raised by the Appellant.
 
[11] The evidence at the trial was summarized in the Judgment dated 18th April 2012 as:
 
 
The Appellant was the father of the complainant.
 
 
The complainant was born on the 18th April 1992 and was 14 years old at the time the alleged offence of rape was committed. The complainant stated in her evidence that she was a resident at Nabuna, Tavua and lived with her parents. She attended school at Tavua and that she stopped schooling due to the alleged incident involving her father. 
 
 
She said on a day in September 2006, the Loloma festival was held at the town park in Tavua which is not far from Nabuna. She was to be accompanied by her aunt named Lavinia who was her neighbor, with some of her children. However, she has met the Appellant at the bus stop and has been asked to go back home. Her mother was not at home as she had left for Lautoka on the previous day after an argument she had with the Appellant.
 
 
The complainant in her evidence stated that after she prepared dinner, she went to sleep in her room. Suddenly she has sensed and seen the Appellant lying on top of her. Describing the act of the Appellant, the complainant stated that she felt the Appellant inserting his male organ into her vagina. Then the complainant pushed the Appellant and managed to get away from him. Thereafter, the complainant has cried and went into another room to lie down. She revealed the incident to Lavinia on the following morning upon being questioned by her. The complainant further stated that the Appellant was in the habit of touching her private parts since 2004 when she was in class 7. 
 
 
[12] In cross examination, the complainant testified that the Appellant was at home in September 2006 and stated that the complaint was lodged by her on the 4th October 2006. She admitted that she was accompanied to the hospital by her aunt Lavinia.
 
 
[13] Under cross examination the complainant refuted the suggestion that her aunt inserted her fingers into her vagina. At the conclusion of cross examination she stated that the Appellant was trying to insert his penis into her vagina. However when it was suggested to her by the defence she admitted that the Appellant did not rape her on the day in question.
 
 
[14] In re examination the complainant stated that she was raped by the Appellant and what she meant by the word ‘rape’ as stated in the history recorded in the Medical Evidence Form in paragraph 12, was that they ‘were together intimating’.
 
 Further the complainant stated that the Appellant had intercourse with her and the act was committed by the Appellant without her consent. 
 
 At the conclusion of her re examination, explaining the different versions given by her in examination- in-chief and in cross-examination, the complainant stated that the correct position is that she was raped by the Appellant that day. 
 
[15] Prosecution witness - Dr. Janice Brown in her evidence stated that she has a MBBS degree with 6 years experience. She has examined the witness on the 4th October 2006 at the Tavua hospital. According to her report, marked and produced as exhibit 4, she has observed that the patient was withdrawn and was afraid of her father whom she thought might physically harm her if she reported him to the police.
 
 
[16] Further, the doctor (in the history given by the complainant) has observed that the patient was having social problems and somewhere in 2004 the mother had left home. Since then the Appellant has forcibly had sexual intercourse with the patient namely Sovaia Tei on number of occasions. According to the report, the doctor has observed her hymen was absent and has opined that it may have happened due to recent vaginal penetration or by insertion of two fingers. There was no evidence of any scarring, due to the absence of any recent lacerations.
 
 
[17] According to Prosecution witness Lavinia Tinai, in 2006 she was an immediate neighbour of the complainant. She has been living in Nabuna village for almost two decades. She confirmed that on the 25th September 2006, she went to the Loloma festival with her children and the children of the Appellant. At the bus stand they have met the Appellant and the complainant has returned home with him. The next morning she has seen the complainant crying and upon being questioned she has revealed that the Appellant had sexual intercourse with her in the previous night. Having reported the matter to the village committee, the witness has taken the complainant to the police station. 
 
 
[18] In cross examination she admitted that she was the village traditional nurse but denied performing any traditional medicinal ritual on the complainant . She also denied that she had any animosity towards the Appellant.
 
 
[19] The caution statement of the Appellant was marked and produced as evidence before court consequent to a voire dire inquiry, which held that the caution statement was made voluntarily.
 
 
[20] Testifying under oath, the Appellant stated that he was residing in Vatukoula in September 2006, due to ill health. He further stated that his sister took him to Vatukoula and he was at her house. He also stated that he returned only on the 4th October 2006 and then only he was made aware of the alleged complaint by the Nabuna village committee members. He alleged that they came to his house accompanied by the complainant. Thereafter, he has gone to the police station with his wife. Further, the Appellant in his evidence stated that the aunt of the complainant namely Lavinia gave false evidence in court. The Appellant also alleged that Lavinia was not on good terms with him. The Appellant completely denied the allegation made against him by his daughter.
 
 
[21] The Appellant in his evidence also stated that his admission of guilt to the allegation of rape in his charge statement was due to his sickness, as he was suffering from a liver ailment at that time.
 
 
Ground 1
 
 
 ‘The learned Magistrate erred in law and fact when he did not consider in his judgment the ‘Serious doubt’ that arose from the admission of the complaint under cross-examination of state witness relating to the allegation.’ 
 
 
[22] It is clear from the judgment that the learned Magistrate has set out the evidence presented at the trial. In this endeavor, the learned Magistrate has referred to the evidence of both the prosecution and the defence. In the judgment he has narrated the evidence of the complainant that was elicited in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination. The learned Magistrate has referred to the contradictory positions taken up by the complainant in answer to the suggestion that she was not raped by the Appellant. Further, the learned Magistrate has also considered the evidence of the complainant given in re-examination, where she categorically stated that the Appellant raped her. The contention of the defence is that the complainant admitted in cross examination when it was suggested to her that she was not raped by the Appellant. However, in re-examination the complainant has corrected her position stating that the Appellant tried to put his private part into her private part and has categorically stated that the Appellant raped her without her consent.
 
 
[23] I observe that the learned Magistrate has also questioned the witness regarding the alleged conduct of the Appellant pertaining to the above position. The complainant in answer to Court has given a specific answer in the affirmative and has categorically stated that the Appellant raped her. Therefore, I see no merit in the above ground of appeal which alleged that there was a ‘serious doubt’ in the evidence of the complainant. 
 
The Appellant took up the position that the medical evidence created a doubt as to whether there was recent penetration and that the evidence of the complainant only suggests an attempt to rape. Hence, I wish to consider the following evidence. 
 
 
[24] Dr. Janice Brown, who examined the victim on the 4th October 2006, is an independent witness. She has observed that the complainant’s hymen was not intact and she has observed that it has ruptured some time ago. The Doctor was not definite in her opinion as to how it could have happened. She also stated that she did not observe any lacerations suggestive of any injuries. Therefore, the Doctor has come to the conclusion that there was no recent intercourse. However, when she was asked in cross-examination whether there was evidence of any forcible intercourse, the doctor has answered in the negative and stated that the complainant may have succumbed. 
 
 
[25] Expressing her opinion, the doctor has stated that she did not observe any evidence suggestive of any recent penetration. The reason given by her was the absence of signs of any healing of the skin. Nevertheless she has stated that she cannot rule out any recent sexual intercourse. 
 
 
[26] As per the prosecution exhibit 4 – the medical report, and the evidence of Dr. Janice Brown the complainant’s hymen was not intact and there was no evidence suggestive of recent lacerations or signs of forced entry. According to paragraph 14 of the medical report, under the heading of diagnosis, the examination had indicated that the hymen was not intact for some time and it may be consistent with the insertion of a finger. Further, the report indicates that the complainant has had sexual intercourse without any lacerations being caused. 
 
 
[27] Therefore, in view of the evidence of the complainant and the doctor, there is no merit in the ground of appeal which alleges that available medical evidence creates a doubt and there was only an attempt to rape. 
 
 
[28] In the case of Spooner v. R [2004] EWCA Crim. 1320 Eng. Court of Appeal, it was held that it is not necessary for the complaint to describe “the full extent of the unlawful sexual conduct.”
 
 
[29] Considering the evidence of the complainant which had been subjected to lengthy cross-examination and despite various suggestions put to her, there are no contradictions or major infirmities other than the ground of appeal raised above. The different positions that were taken up by the complainant too were convincingly explained by the complainant in her evidence. 
 
 
[30] Therefore, I am satisfied that there are no serious infirmities in the evidence of the complainant and in the prosecution case as a whole. Further, it is correct to state that the learned Magistrate would have observed the demeanour and the deportment of the witnesses who testified before court. The learned Magistrate also had an opportunity to observe the demeanour of the Appellant who testified under oath. Therefore, undoubtedly he was in a better position to adjudicate on the evidence led before him, especially to arrive at a decision that the evidence of the complainant was credible and cogent. 
 
 
[31] Therefore, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate had the priceless advantage of observing the witnesses before arriving at a final conclusion in this matter. 
 
 
[32] In his judgment, the learned Magistrate has concluded that the evidence of the complainant is credible and forthcoming. Further, he has also taken the evidence of Dr Janice Brown into consideration, who is an independent witness for the prosecution, along with the evidence of Lavinia Tinai, who corroborated the evidence of the complainant on material points such as the prompt complaint and the presence of the Appellant in the area at or about the time the alleged offence was committed. The above evidence in my view has strengthened the prosecution case. 
 
 
[33] Having considered the evidence of the Appellant and his defence of alibi the learned Magistrate has rejected the defence evidence in toto. 
 
 
[34] It has been held by the learned Magistrate that the available evidence lends credence to the evidence of the complainant and has proceeded to reject the evidence of the Appellant who took up a total denial. Thus this confirms that the learned Magistrate held that the complainant was a credible witness. In the circumstances, I hold that the learned Magistrate was correct in concluding that the Appellant was guilty as charged. Therefore, I find no merit in this ground of appeal raised by the defence and dismiss the appeal against the conviction.
 
 
Appeal against Sentence
 
 
[35] The Appellant raised two grounds of appeal against sentence. 
 
 (a) That the learned Sentencing Judge erred in law when he imposed a sentence outside of the accepted tariff.
 (b) That the learned Sentencing Judge erred in law when he did not separately deduct the 3 months remand period from the total sentence after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors.
 

[36] At the hearing, the Respondent conceded both these grounds.
 
 
[37] Section 23(3) of the Court of Appeal Act provides:
 
 
“On an appeal against sentence, the Court of Appeal shall, if they think that a different sentence should have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial, and pass such other sentence warranted by law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in substitution therefore as they think ought to have been passed, or may dismiss the appeal or make such other order as they think just.”
 
 
[38] Accordingly, I now proceed to consider the above grounds raised against the sentence.
 
 
[39] The learned Sentencing Judge having considered the transfer and the conviction by the learned Magistrate, has considered Section 150 of the Penal Code (Cap. 17) which prescribes imprisonment of life as maximum sentence.
 
 
[40] Referring to State v. AV [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192. 2008, 21st February 2009, the learned Sentencing Judge has correctly identified the tariff for rape of a child as a term between 10 – 16 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[41] Given the nature of the offence the learned Sentencing Judge has held that it is a case of incestral rape. He has further stated that the Appellant being the biological father of the complainant had ruined her life which is unacceptable. Therefore, the learned Sentencing Judge has commenced the sentence at 16 years which is at the highest end of the tariff.
 
 
[42] Then the learned Sentencing Judge considering the following aggravating factors has increased the sentence by 4 years. 
 
 
 (a) the Appellant was the biological father;
 (b) complete breach of trust of father daughter relationship;
 (c) you were 48 years and she was 14 years old child;
 (d) the Appellant made the child to feel her life is totally wasted and her loss of dignity.
 

The total sentence is 20 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[43] Having considered the mitigating circumstances and the 3 months spent in remand, the learned trial judge has deducted two years and handed down 18 years of imprisonment. 
 
 
[44] Given the nature of the relationship existed between the complainant and the offender – (father and daughter), the learned trial judge, acting under Section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, has imposed 16 years of imprisonment as a non parole period.
 
 
[45] In the case of Koroivuki v. State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.10 (5 March 2013) Goundar JA held:
 
 
 
“The purpose of tariff in sentencing is to maintain uniformity in sentences. Uniformity in sentences is a reflection of equality before the law. Offender committing similar offences should know that punishments are even-handedly given in similar cases. When punishments are even-handedly given to the offenders, the public’s confidence in the criminal justice system is maintained. 
 
 
In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.”
 
 
[46] In view of the material placed above, I am of the view that the learned trial judge has exceeded the accepted tariff in this kind of an offence. The Court does not for a moment condone the act of rape committed on a child. However, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to select a lower starting point.
 
 
[47] Further, I consider that the learned Sentencing Judge has erred in repeating the two aggravating factors at paragraph 42(a) and (d).
 
 
[48] When considering the mitigating factors, the learned trial judge has taken the 3 months spent in remand as one such ground. Thereafter he has proceeded to deduct 2 years from the total period of imprisonment.
 
 
[49] Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 reads as follows:
 
 
 
“If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
 
[50] In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Apakuki Sowane CAV 0038/2015 it was held that the law required a separate deduction of the period spent on remand from the head sentence but not as part of mitigating factors, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.
 
 
[51] In view of the principle laid down in the above judgment, I am of the view that in future the time spent in remand must not be considered as a mitigating factor and it should be considered separately as stipulated by law. In the instant case the Appellant has spent 3 months in remand. 
 
 
[52] The appropriate sentence in this case is a term of 13 years imprisonment. 
 
 
[53] Section 18 of the Sentence and Penalties Decree 2009, gives discretion to Court to fix a non parole period. Considering the matters referred to by the learned Sentencing Judge and the final sentence pronounced by this Court, I am of the view that ends of justice would be met by imposing a 12 years non parole period. 
 
 
Rajasinghe JA
 
 
[54] I agree and concur with Waidyaratne JA’s findings and conclusion. 
 
 
Orders of the Court
 
  
• The appeal against the conviction is dismissed. 
 
• The appeal against the sentence is allowed.
 
• The Appellant is sentenced to a term of 13 years imprisonment with a non-parole period being 12 years.

1. Livai, after a 4 days trial, the three assessors and the court found you guilty of the following charges:
FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Cap 17.

Particulars of Offence

LIVAI TAMANALEVU between the 1st day and 31st day of January 2010 at Kuku, Bau in the Central Division unlawfully and indecently assaulted R. K.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

LIVAI TAMANALEVU between the 1st day of February 2010 and 14th day of May 2010 at Kuku, Bau, Tailevu in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted R. K.

THIRD COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and section 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

LIVAI TAMANALEVU on the 15th day of May 2010 at Kuku, Bau, Tailevu in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of R. K without her consent.

FOURTH COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and section 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

LIVAI TAMANALEVU between the 1st day of August 2010 and 31st August 2011 at Kuku, Bau, Tailevu in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of R. K without her consent.

2. The court then convicted you on all the four counts. Briefly, the facts were as follows. The female complainant was born on 24th July 1994. She was the child of your wife's younger sister. So, she was your niece by marriage. In December, 2009, the female complainant lived with her relatives in Nadi. She was 15 ½ years old at the time. Her parents were in the United States. In January, 2010, it was discovered that the complainant was 4 to 5 months pregnant. You and your wife offered to take her to your village at Kuku, Tailevu, to look after her and her child.

3. Her family in Nadi agreed, and in January 2010, you and your wife took the complainant to Kuku, Tailevu. There, she became part of your family, which included you, your wife and your only female daughter – about the same age as the complainant. As soon as she arrived in your house, at Kuku, you secretly began to abuse her by fondling her breast, body and kissing her in the neck and mouth. You repeated these on numerous occasions, between January and May 2010, when your wife and daughter were away.

4. On 15th May, 2010, you raped her in your house. Thereafter you began to rape her twice a week, until she could not take your abuse anymore, and she fled to her relatives in Nadi, in August 2011. So, in a sense, you repeatedly rape this complainant twice a week for more than 1 year 2 months. She complained to her aunty, your wife, but she didn't believe her, and she took your side. For the abuse you have done on this complainant, you have to accept that your liberty will have to be taken away from you.

5. I note you have 11 previous convictions beginning in 1987, but I will disregard 10 of them because they are more than 10 years old. In the last 10 years, you have only 1 previous conviction of being ""found in possession of dangerous drugs"" in 2008. I have taken into account your well prepared plea in mitigation, including your antecedent report, and the victim impact report. I note you disputed some of the matters contained in the victim impact report. I have noted your character references from the church and the village, including your counsel's submission on sentence. I have also taken into account the prosecution's submission on sentence.

6. As I have said in State v Poate Rainima, Criminal Case No. HAC 034 of 2011S, High Court, Suva, ""rape"" is always a serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. It is the worst form of sexual assault on an individual. It is an unwanted invasion of a person's body without that person's consent. Consequently, the courts take a dim view of it, and have set a tariff of 7 to 15 years imprisonment. The worse form of rape is reserved for the higher end of the tariff. see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal.

7. For ""indecent assault"", the maximum sentence is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff for ""indecent assault"" is a sentence between 1 to 4 years imprisonment. The more serious the indecent assault is, the higher the sentence will be: see Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0068 of 2002S, High Court, Suva; Sikeli Nayate v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 46 of 2008, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.

8. The aggravating factors were as follows:
(i) This complainant looked to you and your wife, as her uncle and aunty. Her mother is your wife's younger sister. She was in a vulnerable situation, because her parents were in the United States. You and your wife offered to look after her and her child in Kuku Village, Tailevu. Her relatives in Nadi, and she herself, trusted you in your above undertaking. But as soon as she arrived in your house, at Kuku, Tailevu, you began to secretly abuse her by indecently fondling her breast and body, including kissing her in the neck and mouth. These indecent acts were often done when your wife and daughter were away from home. This was a serious breach of trust by person of authority, since she looked to you as an uncle.

(ii) You did not stop there. On 15th May, 2010, while she was 9 months pregnant, you did the unthinkable by raping her, in your house. This is not the way to treat a pregnant woman. Your sexual assault on her was so forceful to the extend that she gave birth the next day ie. 16th May 2010. One week thereafter, you turned her world into a living hell. You began to rape her twice a week for the next 1 year 2 months. She complained to your wife – her aunty – but she never believed her. She was fed up with your abuse that she fled in August 2011 to her relatives in Nadi. She then reported the matter to police. Your treatment of this complainant was the worst form of abuse coming from a 44 year old uncle, towards her 15 ½ to 16 years old niece.

9. The mitigating factors were as follows:
(i) You are 44 years old, married with a 17 years old daughter.

(ii) You are the sole breadwinner for the family, although your wife assists by being a food vendor, twice a week.

(iii) You are an active member of the village and the church.

(iv) You have been remanded in custody for the last 4 days.

10. Because the rape offences are serious, I will start sentencing on them. On count no. 3, I start with a sentence of 9 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the same by 6 years to 15 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the same by 1 year to 14 years imprisonment. On count no. 3, I sentence you to 14 years imprisonment.

11. On count no. 4, I repeat the process and sentence in count no. 3.

12. On the indecent assault charge in count no. 1, I start with 2 years imprisonment. I increase the same by 1 year to 3 years for the aggravating factors. I decrease the same by 6 months to 2 ½ years imprisonment for the mitigating factors. On count no. 1, I sentence you to 2 ½ years imprisonment.

13. I repeat the above process and sentence for count no. 2.

14. In summary, your sentences are as follows:
(i) Count No. 1:
Indecent Assault:
2 ½ years imprisonment.
(ii) Count No. 2:
Indecent Assault:
2 ½ years imprisonment.
(iii) Count No. 3:
Rape:
14 years imprisonment
(iv) Count No. 4:
Rape:
14 years imprisonment.

15. Given the principle of totality of sentencing, I order that the above sentences are to be served concurrently, that is, a total sentence of 14 years imprisonment. Livai, for the offences you have committed against the complainant, I sentence you to 14 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.

40,768,268266,"RULING
 
 
[1] This is an application for an enlargement of time to file an application for leave to appeal.
 
 
[2] The Appellant was convicted in the High Court at Suva on two counts of rape following a trial before a judge sitting with three assessors. On 21 February 2013 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 years on the first count and 13 years on the second count to be served concurrently with a non-parole term of 14 years.
 
 
[3] A formal application by way of notice of motion for an extension of time to file an application for leave to appeal was filed on 11 February 2014 on behalf of the Appellant. The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 10 February 2014 by Abdul Rashid. The application was opposed. The parties filed written submissions prior to the hearing of the application.
 
 
[4] Under section 26 of the Court of Appeal Act Cap 12 (the Act) the Appellant was required to give notice of his application for leave to appeal within 30 days of the date of the decision. In this case the sentencing decision was delivered on 21 February 2013. On the basis that the application for leave was required to be filed no later than 23 March 2013, the application for leave was filed about 10½ months out of time.
 
 
[5] However under the same section (section 26) of the Act the Court of Appeal may extend at any time the time within which a notice of application for leave to appeal may be given. Pursuant to section 35(1) of the Act a justice of appeal may exercise the power of the Court to extend the time within which an application for leave to appeal may be given.
 
 
[6] The factors that are considered when a court is called upon to determine an application for an extension of time under section 26(3) of the Act were discussed by the Supreme Court in Kaliova Rasaku and Another –v- The State (unreported CAV 9 and 13 of 2012; 24 April 2013). During the course of that judgment the Supreme Court applied the decision of Gates CJ (with whom Hettige and Ekanayake JJ concurred) in Kumar and Sinu –v- The State (unreported CAV 1 of 2009; 21 August 2012) who summarised the factors to be considered as being (i) the length of the delay, (ii) the reason for the failure to file within time, (iii) whether there is a ground of merit justifying the appellate court's consideration or, where there has been substantial delay, nonetheless is there a ground of appeal that will probably succeed and (iv) if time is enlarged, will the Respondent be unfairly prejudiced? These are all matters that are relevant to a determination as to whether it would be just in all the circumstance to grant or refuse the application.
 
 
[7] The explanation for the delay of about 10½ months was set out in the supporting affidavit. The Appellant deposed that following his trial he decided to look for a different legal practitioner for his appeal. This took some time as he had had no previous experience with the criminal justice system. He also needed time to raise the funds for a private practitioner as apart from one elderly aunt in Fiji, his close relatives reside overseas. The Appellant stated that he did not wish to engage the free services of a legal aid lawyer. He also appeared to rely on his lack of education for the delay in arranging legal representation.
 
 
[8] The Supreme Court has acknowledged that incarcerated appellants who are unrepresented do face difficulties in the preparation of their appeals. However those difficulties do not justify setting aside the requirements of the Act and the Rules (See: Raitamata –v- The State unreported CAV 2 of 2007; 25 February 2008 and Sheik Mohammed –v- The State unreported CAV 2 of 2013; 27 February 2014).
 
 
[9] The explanation for the delay does not by itself lead to the conclusion that an extension of time should be granted. It is necessary to determine whether the appeal has sufficient merit to justify the Appellant's non-compliance with the Rules.
 
 
[10] In the Appellant's exhibited notice of appeal there were listed a total of seven grounds of appeal of which five were grounds of appeal against conviction and two were grounds of appeal against sentence upon which he proposed to rely in the event that time is enlarged. They are:
 
 
""1. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when he failed to outline the available defences open to the accused when summing up to the assessors.
 
 
2. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when he failed to direct the assessors properly in regards to the inherent weaknesses of the prosecution case.
 
 
3. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when he failed to highlight to the assessors the discrepancies in the medical report which favoured the defence.
 
 
4. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when at para. 13 of the summing up he failed to advise the assessors that another option available for them to consider was the Accused did not have sex with the complainant at all, the defence being advanced by the Appellant at trial.
 
 
5. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when at para. 21 of the summing up he failed to outline to the assessors that the money paid to the complainant's father was a possible motive for the complainant and her mother to lie about the allegation of rape, a direction the assessors needed to consider when looking at the evidence.
 
 
6. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact when he failed to allow the Accused time to mitigate.
 
 
7. That the sentence is manifestly harsh and excessive.""
 
 
[11] It must be recalled that it is not the task of a justice of appeal on an application under section 35(1) of the Act to determine the appeal. However in this case, in order to determine the application it is necessary to consider whether the appeal has sufficient merit and in this case that involves determining whether the appeal is likely to succeed. This is a more onerous standard than would be the case if the Appellant were merely seeking leave to appeal, in which case all that need be established is that the appeal raises an arguable ground.
 
 
[12] At the outset, it is necessary to indicate that as presently drafted, the first three grounds of appeal against conviction are too wide and fail to specify the nature of the errors, the failures or the omissions upon which each ground relies.
 
 
[13] Grounds 1 and 2 allege errors in the summing up concerning (1) available defences open to the Appellant and (2) inherent weaknesses of the Respondent's case. No particulars are provided. In the written submissions the Appellant identifies only two matters. One concerns a reference to paragraph 21 of the summing up and the other to paragraph 18 of the summing up. It is suggested that there was a difference in emphasis in the directions given in those paragraphs that was disadvantageous to the Appellant. In my judgment the difference was subtle and although going to credibility does not raise a ground sufficient to justify granting an extension of time. There are no other specific issues raised in the submissions in relation to grounds 1 and 2.
 
 
[14] Ground 3 concerns an issue arising from the contents of the medical report. In one section, but not in the others, there is a correction in relation to whether the hymen was intact. The correction, apparently made by the Doctor who wrote the report and presumed to have been made contemporaneously with the report itself involved the crossing out of the word 'intact' and replacing with the words ""(error) not intact"". The report was put into evidence through another doctor. The author of the report was not available. In other parts of the report the doctor had clearly stated that the hymen was not intact. The report spoke for itself. Both the assessors and the learned trial Judge were at liberty to attach whatever weight they thought appropriate to the admitted medical report. There was no objection at the trial and the Appellant's Counsel did not seek to have the doctor who compiled the report cross-examined. In my judgment this ground does not meet the required standard in his application.
 
 
[15] Ground 4 is sufficiently particularised and is succinctly explained in the Appellant's submissions. The gist of the complaint is this. In paragraph 11 of the summing up the learned Judge correctly stated the Appellant's defence when he indicated to the assessors that ""He says that he never had sexual intercourse with (the complainant) let alone raped her."" Then in paragraph 12 and 13 the learned Judge discusses the issue of consent apparently because the Respondent claimed that it was relevant. In paragraph 13, the learned Judge appears to assume that sexual intercourse did take place and informs the assessors that the issue for them to consider is consent. They are not asked to determine whether, as a fact, any act of sexual intercourse took place between the Appellant and the Complainant in respect of either count 1 or count 2. There is no reference in the summing up, apart from in paragraph 11, that the assessors should consider the evidence in the context of the defence case that sexual intercourse never took place. I am satisfied that this ground raises an issue that has sufficient merit to allow the application for an extension of time.
 
 
[16] Ground 5 was not seriously pursued by the Appellant at the hearing on the basis that it appeared to raise similar issues to those raised by grounds 1 and 2. It does not have sufficient merit to justify extending time to appeal.
 
 
[17] Grounds 6 and 7 relate to the appeal against sentence. To obtain leave to appeal against sentence the appellant must point to an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The onus is higher when an extension of time is sought. The issue of no opportunity to mitigate was admitted by Counsel for the Appellant to have been the result of the Appellant having absconded before the summing up in breach of bail. Counsel for the Appellant also conceded that there did not appear to be any arguable error in the exercise by the trial Judge of his sentencing discretion. Neither ground was vigorously pursued by Counsel and neither ground has sufficient merit to justify an extension of time.
 
 
[18] There is one further matter that requires comment in this Ruling. The Appellant appeared in the High Court for trial on 2 counts of rape. It is appropriate to re-state both counts.
 
 
""COUNT 1
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap. 17.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ABDUL RASHEED s/o Abdul Rahiman, between 1st day of February 2005 and the 31st day of December 2005 at Nasinu in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl, namely ARTIKA SONAM SINGH, without her consent.
 
 
COUNT 2
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Sections 207(1) (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ABDUL RASHEED s/o Abdul Rahiman, on the 20th day of March 2011 at Nasinu in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl, namely ARTIKA SONAM SINGH, without her consent.""
 
 
[19] At paragraph 8 of the summing up the learned Judge explained to the assessors the two counts in this way:
 
 
""The accused is facing two separate counts of rape. Count one and count two are specimen counts. The prosecution allege that Abdul Rasheed also committed many other offences of the same kind between 2005 and 2011. Instead of overloading the information with counts charging many offences, they have selected two incidents, one at the beginning of the period and one at the end. They are entitled to do this. To convict the accused you must be sure that he committed the particular offences in the information, that is on the 9th February 2005 and lastly on the 20th March 2011. Just because you think he is guilty of one of the offences does not make him guilty of both. You must look at each count separately.""
 
 
[20] However it does appear that count 1 only is a specimen charge and leaves open the fact that a number of instances of alleged rape took place between 1 February and 31 December 2005. However count 2 refers to one act of alleged rape having taken place on a specific date, namely 20 March 2011. As drafted there is no grammatical link between the period in 2005 that is alleged in count 1 and the one date alleged in 2011 in count 2. If it had been intended to rely on numerous alleged instances of rape between 1 February 2005 and 20 March 2011, the charge could adequately have been drafted in one count only. This is required by section 70(3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 which provides that ""when a person is charged with any offence of a sexual nature and the evidence points to more than one separate acts of misconduct, it shall be sufficient to specify the dates between which the acts occurred in one count and the prosecution must prove that between the specified dates at least one act of a sexual nature occurred. In such a case the charge must specify on the statement of offence that the count is a representative one.""
 
 
[21] As a result what was before the Court was one representative (or specimen) count for the period 1 February 2005 and 31 December 2005. There was a second count alleging one offence of rape on a specific date in 2011. There was no count before the Court for any alleged offence that may have occurred between 1 January 2006 and 19 March 2011. Any evidence adduced at the trial that was intended to establish that an offence of rape had been committed between those dates was irrelevant and should not have been admitted.
 
 
[22] It may well be that the directions given to the assessors in paragraph 8 of the summing up do not accurately reflect the effect of alleging with a specimen count a separate much later single offence in count 2 of the indictment. The position in relation to such a situation was discussed by the Court of Appeal in Hobson –v- Regina [2013] 1 WLR 3733, [2013 EWCA Crim. 819 which in my judgment reflects an approach which is consistent with section 70(3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree.
 
 
[23] Putting that issue to one side, the application for an extension of time is granted in respect of ground 4 for which leave to appeal against conviction is granted. The Appellant is at liberty to file and serve a notice of appeal within 30 days from the date of this judgment.
 
 
Orders:
 
  
• Application for extension of time is granted.
 
• Leave to appeal against conviction is granted.
 
• Leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

• You then pleaded guilty to all the counts. The matter was then adjourned to 1 February 2017 to enable the prosecution to prepare their summary of facts in court. 
 
 
• On 1 February 2017, the prosecutor presented their summary of facts in court. Briefly, they were as follows. On 15 October 2015, the accused was 33 years old. In 2004, he married Uleshni Iren Lata, the deceased in count no. 4. At the time of her death, Ms. Lata was 29 years old. The couple had a 10 year old daughter, Prisika Devi, the deceased in count no. 3. The accused, his wife and daughter normally resided with his wife’s family prior to the incident. They resided at Lot 59, Navosai Road, Narere. The house was divided into 3 flats. The main flat (ie Flat No. 2) were occupied by the accused, his wife, daughter and in-laws. The house belonged to his mother-in-law, Hans Wati (PW1). Another flat was occupied by Imran Ershad Ali, the deceased in count no. 5. He was 30 years old, at the time. Living with him was his wife, Faria Farnaaz Ali, who was the deceased in count no. 6. She was 22 years old at the time.
 
 
• The problem in this case started as a result of the disagreements between the accused and his wife. It reached a stage where the wife and her family obtained a “Domestic Violence Restraining Order” against the accused. The order forbade the accused to stay with his wife and daughter at Lot 59 Navosai Road, Narere. He was not to contact his family and in-laws. This made the accused upset and angry. This was the catalyst to what occurred on 15 October 2015. On the early morning of 15 October 2015, the accused with another was driving in a rental car from Tavua, Rakiraki, Korovou, Nausori and to Narere. On the way, the accused got three 20 liters plastic containers from Rakiraki. In Korovou he filled the containers with unleaded fuel from a Mobile Service Station. He drove down to Nausori and Narere. At about 11.30 pm on 15 October 2015, he approached his in-laws’ house. He poured unleaded fuel around the house. He called his wife. She appeared and open the door. The accused threw the fuel on her and set her on fire.
 
 
• The fire spread rapidly in the house, and burnt his wife, daughter and father-in-law to death. Mr and Mrs Ali were also burnt to death in their flat. Jotishma Neelam was also burnt, but survived the incident. Mohammed Khalil’s taxi was a write-off, as a result of the damage by fire.
 
 
• The court checked with the accused’s counsel to see that he was admitting to all the elements of the offences from count no. 1 to 8. Through his counsel, the accused admitted the particulars of offences in count no. 1 to 8, and admitted the prosecution’s summary of facts. The accused also admitted all the elements of the offences from count no. 1 to 8. As a result of the above, the court found him guilty as charged on all counts, and convicted him accordingly on those counts.
 
 
• You had been convicted of five murder charges (ie. count no. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), one charge of “attempted murder” (count no. 7), one charge of “arson” (count no. 1) and one charge of “damaging property” (count no. 8). I will start sentencing you on the murder charges, because they are the most serious of all the offences.
 
 
• There is only one sentence for murder, and that is a mandatory life imprisonment (section 237 of the Crimes Decree 2009). However, the Court has the power to fix a minimum term to be served before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji (section 119 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji).
 
 
• I cannot pretend but say, that what you did to your wife, daughter, father-in-law and Mr and Mrs Ali on 15 October 2015, when you burnt them to death, was the height of all evil. You have taken away the life of your wife, who was 29 years old at the time. You had taken away the life of your daughter, who was 10 years old at the time. You had taken away your father-in-law’s life, and he was 55 years old at the time. Mr Ali was 30 years old at the time. Mrs Ali was 22 years old at the time. You took both their lives away. You have no right whatsoever to take away a person’s life. That right only belongs to the Almighty.
 
 
• I have taken note of your plea in mitigation. I note that you reached Class 6 education, and was a taxi driver by profession. You earned $400 per week. I also note that you had been remanded in custody since 21 October 2015, that is, approximately 1 year 4 months ago. I also note that you are a first offender. You also pleaded guilty to the charges approximately 1 year 4 months after the first call in the High Court. By doing so, you saved the court’s time.
 
 
• A lot of murders in this country arose because of the turmoils in most families. Yes, disagreement and discontent are part and parcel of most family life in this country and the world. But people must learn to resolve their problems in a peaceful way. That is why the Family Courts are there ie. to resolve problems peacefully. This was the case in your family. A “Domestic Violence Restraining Order” was in existence against you. You should have resolved your problems through the courts, but you choose to go outside the law. You burnt your mother-in-law’s house and killed five people in the same, when you burnt them to death. You should not complain about your sentence, because they are to atone for your misdeeds.
 
 
• I start with the murder charge in count no. 2. I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment.
 
 
• On the murder charges in count no. 3, 4, 5 and 6, I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment, for each count.
 
 
• What minimum term shall I impose on each murder charge, that will serve the interest of justice? Both parties had referred me to the case of Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji. In this case, the appellant was convicted and sentenced on 5 counts of murder and 1 of attempted murder. For each murder charge, he was given the mandatory life imprisonment with a minimum term of 19 years each. He was serving 10 years prison term for another offence, which was made consecutive to the sentence in the murder charge. Total non-parole period came to 26 years. This case is somewhat similar to this case, which also involved 5 murder convictions and 1 attempted murder conviction. However, the only different between the cases was the method of killing. In the other case, he used iron bars and stones to kill his victims. In this one, he use petrol from a service station to burn a house and burnt five people to death. I would put the minimum term to be served as 28 years imprisonment on each murder count. In doing so, I’ve taken into account the matters mentioned above.
 
 
• For the “attempted murder” charge (count no. 7), I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 10 years to be served before a pardon by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji may be considered.
 
 
• For the “arson” charge (count no. 1), I sentence you to 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
• For the “damaging property” charge (count no. 8), I sentence you to 1 year imprisonment.
 
 
• The summary of your sentences are as follows: 
• (i) Count No. 1 Arson : 10 years imprisonment
 
• (ii) Count No. 2 Murder : mandatory life imprisonment with a minimum 


term of 28 years to be served before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
 (iii) Count No. 3 Murder : “ “ “
 (iv) Count No. 4 Murder : “ “ “
 (v) Count No. 5 Murder : “ “ “
 (vi) Count No. 6 Murder : “ “ “
 (vii) Count No. 7 Attempted : mandatory life imprisonment with a minimum 

Murder term of 10 years to be served before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
 (viii) Count No. 8 Damaging : 1 year imprisonment

• Mr. KAVERIELI VATUOROORO, you tendered an unequivocal 'plea of guilty' on 4th May, 2017 to the following count when you were represented by a Counsel. 

Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2) (b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
KAVERIELI VATUOROORO, between the 4th day of February 2017 and the 5th day of February 2017, at Toge, Ba in the Western Division, penetrated the vulva of LUSIANA ROKOCA, with his finger, without her consent.
  
• You were explained the consequence of the guilty plea and the tariff of the sentence. You understood the same and maintained your plea of guilt. I accepted your guilty plea when I was satisfied that it was unequivocal, voluntary and free from any influence. 
 
• You agreed the summary of facts filed by the State on 6th July 2017. I found that the summary of facts proved each element of count of Rape with which you were charged. You were convicted of Rape accordingly. You now come before this Court for sentence.

4. The summary of facts filed by the State was that:
 
The complainant is Lusiana Rokoca, aged 28 years, School Teacher, of Toge Village, Ba (“complainant”). The defendant is Kaverieli Vatuorooro, aged 21 years, Farmer, of Toge Village, Ba (“the defendant”).
 
 
The complainant and the defendant knew each other as they resided in the same community. The complainant resided with her 2- year- old daughter in her house.
 
 
On 4th February 2017, around 7.00 pm the complainant returned home with her daughter from town. After dinner they went to sleep. Around 11.30 pm in the night the complainant heard the sound of burglar bars being pulled. She went to check in the middle room, and saw the defendant entering the same room through the burglar bars on the room’s window. The complainant asked what the defendant was doing and in response the defendant said for her to be quiet.
 
 
The defendant then covered the complainant’s mouth and took her to the bedroom where she and her daughter were sleeping. The complainant was struggling to break free. By this time the daughter had woken up and was crying. The defendant pushed the complainant onto the floor then came closer to her. The defendant heavily smelt of liquor. He then forcefully lifted the round neck t-shirt she was wearing and her bra, and then he sucked her breasts. He also licked the complainant’s neck and stomach.
 
 
After that the defendant forcefully opened the ¾ pants that the complainant was wearing, placed his hand inside her panty and poked her vagina thereby penetrating the vulva of the complainant with his finger. The complainant was scared for the safety of her daughter hence she let the defendant do what he was doing. Then the defendant told the complainant to hold his penis, which she did out of fear.
 
 
Thereafter, the defendant stood up and went outside. He then apologized to the complainant for what he had done and asked her not to tell anyone about it. The complainant then informed her mother and her younger sibling of what the defendant had done, and later she rang and reported the incident to the police.
 
 
The complainant was medically examined on 05/02/2017 around 11.09 am by one Dr. Talei Tamaka (“PW2”) at Ba Mission Hospital. PW2 noted “slight areas of hyperemia consistent with friction/recent pressure at introitus”. A copy of the medical report is annexed.
 
 
The defendant was taken into custody and caution interviewed on 06/02/2017. At Q.32 and Q.33 of the caution interview, the defendant admitted to entering the complainant’s house through the window. At Q.37 the defendant said that he had pressed the complainant’s mouth and dragged her when they were in the complainant’s bedroom and not in the middle room. At Q.38 the defendant said that the complainant pushed him away when they were in her bedroom and not in the middle room. At Q.39 the defendant admitted that he tried to kiss the complainant but she pushed him away. At Q.40 the defendant said that he told the complainant to lift her t-shirt and he sucked her breasts. At Q.42 the defendant admitted to poking the complainant’s vagina with his finger. 
 
 
5. The maximum sentence for rape is imprisonment for life.
  
• The tariff for adult rape is well settled. The starting point for adult rape is seven years’ imprisonment Kasim v The State (Crim App. No. AAU0021j of 1993S) and the tariff is set between 7 and 15 years’ imprisonment (State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338).
 
• In selecting the starting point, I considered the objective seriousness of the offending. You invaded the complainant’s house in night when complainant was on bed with her 2 year old daughter. The rape was committed in a frightening manner. Considering the circumstances of the offending, I pick a starting point of 8 years from the lower end of the tariff. 

8. Aggravating Circumstances 
 
 ➢ You used violence to commit this offence. You closed Complainant’s mouth and pushed her to the floor when she was struggling to free herself. 
 ➢ You committed this offence under influence of alcohol and with utter disregard to complainant’s 2 year- old daughter who was crying.
 ➢ Rape committed by you was associated with other forms of indecent assaults (sucking her breasts and licking her neck and stomach) for which you have not been charged. 
 
• Mitigating Circumstances 
• ➢ Your personal circumstances are such that you are relatively young offender, 21 years old. You are a farmer and looking after your ailing father. 
 
• ➢ You admitted the offence at the caution interview and cooperated with police. 
 
• ➢ You pleaded guilty to the charge at the first available opportunity. You thereby saved precious time and other resources of this court and prevented the complainant giving evidence and repeating her ordeal. 
 
• ➢ You have been remorseful. After committing this offence, you stood up and went outside and apologized for your behavior. 
 
• ➢ You are a first offender and have maintained a clear record thus far. 
 
• ➢ You sought forgiveness of this court and promise not to reoffend.

 
• I increase your sentence by 2 years to reflect aforementioned aggravating features bringing your interim sentence to 10 years’ imprisonment. I deduct 2 years to reflect compelling mitigating circumstances and the time spent in remand (2 days). Your final sentence is 8 years’ imprisonment. 
 
• Your Counsel seeks a lenient sentence for you and strenuously argues that you did not proceed to penetrate complainant’s vagina with your penis and only inserted a finger and you have not satisfied your lustful demands including ejaculation and therefore you are less culpable. 
 
• I do not agree with this contention. Your Counsel’s argument seems to be based on a wrong construction of rape which the modern criminal law rejects. It is based on the myth that rape is a crime of lust or passion. Rape is increasingly being recognized as a crime of power committed against human dignity: men (perhaps women) rape others also because they seek to dominate and brutalize the weak. 
 
• Your Counsel having cited the sentence passed by this Court in State v Ralulu - [2017] FJHC 331; HAC78.2013 (5 May 2017) seeks leniency. 
 
• Sentencing is an inherently individualized process that takes into account the offence as well as the offender of each particular case. R v Anglillo 2006 SCC 55, R. v Briand [2010] NJ No. 39 (C.A) R v M (C.A), [1996] S.C.J. No 28. 
 
• In Ralulu (supra) this Court considered special circumstances of that case when it sentenced the offender under tariff, particularly the fact that the offender had just reached his adulthood (he was approximately 18 old) at the time of the offending and victim’s admission that offender was her school mate and lover. The only aggravating factor in that case was that the offender had breached trust as victim’s boyfriend.
 
• In your case you are 21 years old and you committed this offence in a violent manner on a teacher older than you (28 years) in a night time invasion. In the facts agreed by you, there is no relationship in the past, sexual or otherwise, between you and the complainant although your Counsel in his submission has submitted otherwise. 
 
• Having considered your age and the fact that you are a first offender, I impose a non-parole period of 6 years. You are thus eligible to parole after 6 years in prison.

 Summary 
 
18. You are sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.
 
19. You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1), (2) (a) and (3) of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence
NAVEEN SINGH, on the 1st day of November 2010 at LAUTOKA in the ESTERN
DIVISION, used his penis to penetrate the vagina of KW, a 7 year old.

	1.	You pleaded not guilty to above charges. Following trial lasting four days in this Court, you were found guilty on above counts against you.

	2.	After considering the unanimous verdict of Guilty of the assessors and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial, the Court decided to concur with the verdict of the assessors and found you guilty of the above charges.

	3.	The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. The 7 year old victim KW was living in the front house and used to come to your house to watch movies. You have taken her to the wash room and the store room during the period 1st October 2010 to 1st November 2010 on several occasions and had raped her, had sexually abused her. From the evidence it is clear that you breached the relationship between neighbors and had forced the child to have sexual acts with you. 

	4.	You had no remorse for your above conduct.

	5.	According to the Victim Impact Statement filed, there is change in the behavior of the victim after these incidents and it had affected her studies.

	6.	According to the Crimes Decree, the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence. The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of then A.H.C.T. Gates J in State v Marawa. [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.

	7.	In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed:

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

	1.	The tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adult and takes the tariff of 10 to 15 years. 

	2.	In State v Mario Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 Madigan J held that:

""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""

In this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter.

	1.	In State v Anthony [2012] FJHC 1013; HAC 151.2010 Nawana J held that:

""The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl of MB's standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in case of this nature, deterrence is therefore, of paramount importance."" 

	1.	Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 12 years imprisonment for each charge of Rape.

	2.	Aggravating factors;
		(a) Victim is your neighbor, you breached the trust between neighbors
		(b) There are several incidents of rape and indecent assault
		(c) You are not remorseful
		(d) The victim's life had changed and her education affected.

Considering all I increase your sentence by 3 years now the sentence is 15 years imprisonment.

	1.	Mitigating circumstances
		(a) You are first offender
		(b) Time period in remand –98 days.

Considering all I reduce 2 years from your sentence now your sentence is 13 years imprisonment.

	1.	Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 11 years as non parole period.

	2.	The tariff for the offence of Indecent assault is between 1 to 4 years imprisonment as decided in Ratu Penioni Ratoka v State HAA 68 of 2002.

	3.	I start the sentence for each charge of indecent assault at 2 years and add 2 years for the aggravating factors mentioned above and deduct 1 year for the mitigating factors. 

	4.	For each charge of indecent assault, I sentence you for a period of 3 years

Summary

	1.	Your sentences are as follows:
		(i) 1st count of Rape - 13 years
		(ii) 2nd count of Indecent assault - 3 years
		(iii) 4th count of Rape - 13 years
		(iv) 5th count of Indecent assault - 3 years
		(v) 6th count of Indecent assault - 3 years 
		(vi) 7th count of Rape - 13 years 

	2.	Considering the totality principle, I order all the sentences to run concurrently.

	3.	You are sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 11 years of imprisonment.

	4.	30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

	1.	SEREMAIA BELO, you have electedthe Magistrate Court and pleaded Guilty to the following Charge:

Grievous Harm: Contrary to Section 258 of the Crimes Decree Number 44 of 2009 and the Particulars of Offence is as follows; That;

On the 1st day of October, 2012 at Raiwaqa in the Central Division, unlawfully and maliciously did grievous harm to Isimeli Uluimoala.

	1.	The summary of facts of the case that was submitted by the prosecution and admitted by you is as follows;

“On the 01st day of October, 2012 at about 5.00pm you ware playing “tough rugby” with the victim and you have punched the victim’s face without any reason, resulting a broken jaw.”

	1.	I note the memorandum dated 20th November 2012 from St.Giles hospital which states that “the accused now has the basic capacity to comprehend court” Given the report, I am satisfied that your plea as unequivocal and I convict you accordingly.

	2.	I have considered the oral mitigation submission submitted by the learned counsel on your behalf including your personal background :that you are; 

27 years old; single; was a contracted worker at University of Fiji; pleaded guilty; deeply remorseful; fully cooperated with police and attempted to reconcile with the complainant.

	1.	The medical examination report reveals that the victim had a“disfigured, painful jaw”.According to the information revealed by the Summary of Facts you have punched the victim without any reason, which shows lack of provocation and the high degree of violence.Thus the aggravating circumstances are significant.

	2.	Statutory Indication

Section 258of Crimes Decree Number 44 of 2009 reads as follows; 

A person commits an indictable offence (which is triable summarily) if he or she unlawfully and maliciously does grievous harm to another person.

The offence of grievous harm are defined by section 4 of the Crimes Decree as “grievous harm” means any harm which—

(a) amounts to a maim or dangerous harm; or

(b) seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely so to injure health; or

(c) extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or serious injury to any external or internal organ, member or sense;
Maximum Penalty –Imprisonment for 15 years.

	1.	Sentencing

In Sentencing you, I acknowledge and consider your early guilty plea and Mitigating Factors including your personal background. 

I consider the tariff to the offence. In State v Mokubula [2003] FJHC 164; HAA0052J.2003S (23 December 2003) Hon. Justice N. Shameem stated that the tariff for Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Harm should be between two years and sixyears.On the same token I note that the maximum penalty contrary to section 224 of Penal Code is life imprisonment.

In sentencing you I consider Sentencing Guidelines under Section 4 (1) (2) (3) and General Sentencing Provisions under Section 15 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

Considering all the circumstances of this case, I would pick 02 years imprisonment period as the starting point.

I increase 06 months for aggravating factors. For your early guilty plea, I deduct 01 year. I note that you have one previous conviction; therefore you are not eligible for a discount for your previous clear records. In view of migratory factors I deduct 06 months leaving a balance of 12 months imprisonment period. 

You have spent 06 months in remand before the sentence. Fiji court of Appeal in: Prasad v State [2010] FJCA 12; AAU0111.2007(8 April 2010) at paragraph 6referring to Basa v The State[2006] FJCA 23:AAU0024.2005 (24 March, 2006) held;

""As a matter of sentencing principle, any period that the offender spends in custody on remand should be taken into account when calculating the sentence...although it is not necessary to make a precise calculation.""

I also note that although you have granted bail on 27th March 2013 you are remanded in custody up to date as you have failed to provide with a suitable surety. In all the circumstances I find it appropriate to consider the time you spent in custody. Therefore, I reduce 6 months from your sentence. Now your imprisonment period reaches to 06 months.

Section 26 (1)of Sentencing and Penalties Decree No. 42 of 2009 provides that on sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances. 

And now I have to decide whether the sentence is to be served in custody or not. You are remorseful and seek an opportunity to reform and rehabilitate. Pending your sentence you have spent considerable time remanded in custody.In the circumstances, I suspend your sentence.

Accordingly, I sentence you 06 months imprisonment period suspended for 02 years for the offence of Grievous Harm Contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree Number 44 of 2009.

Take this opportunity to rehabilitate and reform yourself so you can constructively contribute for the betterment of your family and society.

Pursuant to section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree if at any time during the operational period of a suspended sentence of imprisonment, should you commit any crime during the suspend period and found guilty by the court you are liable to be charge and prosecute for an offence punishable by imprisonment.

The State submits that the victim is your cousin and lives under the same roof and seeks a permanent Domestic Violence Decree. According to the summary of facts the attack was unprovoked. The accused and victim are related. In the circumstances', I confirm the Interim Domestic Violence restraining order on standard non molestation conditions for the wellbeing of the victim. Failure to obey these conditions amount to a criminal offence for which you may be liable to be charge and prosecute for an offence punishable by imprisonment.

28 days to appeal.

",1,1,0,1,2,sentence,952
45,773,77123,"JUDGMENT

[1] The appellant was convicted of one count of indecent assault and two of rape. The indecent assault and the first rape were committed in 2000 and the second rape in 2003. The victim was the step daughter of the appellant and, at the time of the first offences, was nine or ten years old.

[2] The three assessors gave unanimous opinions of guilty to all three counts. The learned judge concurred with their opinions and convicted the appellant. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment on the indecent assault and eleven years on each count of rape. All were ordered to be served concurrently.

[3] There is one ground of appeal against conviction, namely, that the learned judge should not have allowed the trial to proceed when the appellant was unrepresented. He also appeals against sentence on the ground that the sentence is harsh and oppressive and wrong in principle because it was outside the tariff for such offences.

Ground One

[4] The appellant tells the Court from the bar that he applied for legal aid and that it was refused because the lawyers found the case repulsive. He explained that he made the application after the trial judge had directed legal aid counsel to represent him. He told this Court that both application and refusal were made orally.

[5] There is no evidence to support this account. The record shows that, at the first appearance in the Lautoka High Court on 3 November 2003, the appellant asked for legal aid. At the next appearance he was unrepresented and successfully applied for bail.

[6] He appeared on 23 January 2004 and told the court that he was looking for a lawyer.

[7] Following a number of appearances, he was advised, on 2 July 2004, that the trial would be heard on 16 November 2004. At a subsequent appearance on 2 September 2004, the record states that he was advised to obtain counsel immediately.

[8] When he appeared on 16 November 2004, he was still unrepresented and advised the court that he was ready for the hearing. It was adjourned to the 17th when the appellant again advised the court that he was ready. As a result of the indisposition of the judge the trial was adjourned to the following day when the appellant is recorded as having understood the charges and pleaded not guilty to them all.

[9] The trial proceeded and he conducted his defence including cross examination of the complainant. He made no further application to find counsel but he tells this Court that he proceeded with the trial because he could not afford a lawyer and was not working.

[10] It is preferable that anyone facing a serious charge should be able to be represented by counsel. Unfortunately the limited resources of the State and the financial circumstances of many defendants mean they are unrepresented. In such circumstances the trial court should ensure that the defendant has been allowed reasonable time to instruct counsel. Once he has, the court also has a duty to hear the case as expeditiously as possible. Whenever an accused is unrepresented the court should explain the procedure sufficiently for the accused to be able to conduct his defence.

[11] The question for this Court is whether there is a possibility that he was adversely prejudiced by his lack of representation. In the present case, the record shows that he was given more than adequate time to find counsel, he was advised correctly of his rights by the trial judge and conducted his case competently.

[12] From the record and after considering the appellant’s submissions we find no reason to doubt that he had a fair trial and the appeal against conviction is dismissed.

Ground Two

[13] The appellant suggests that the sentence of eleven years for rape was excessive and outside the tariff for such offences. He claims the tariff has been raised recently and was lower in 2000 to 2003 when these offences were committed. At that time, he suggests the appropriate range of sentences for rape was three to five years and, for more serious cases, five to seven years. 

[14] That is not correct. The courts in Fiji for many years followed the guideline laid down in the English case of Billam and others v R [1986] 8 Cr App R (s) 48 in which the Court stated that five years imprisonment should be taken as the starting point for rape committed by an adult and with no aggravating or mitigating circumstances. However, in 1994, this Court in the unreported case of Mohammed Kasim v State [1994] Cr App No 21 of 1993, 27 May 1994, noted the gravity of rape and stated:

'We consider that in a rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment for seven years. It must be recognised by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower that that starting point.'

[15] The continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in the levels of sentences ordered in rape cases by the courts in Fiji. We endorse that trend. We do not suggest that the starting point described in Mohammed Kasim’s case should be altered in rape cases in general but the sentencing court should not hesitate to increase the sentence substantially where there are further aggravating factors.

[16] There are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust. The seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family. If the child then remains in the family home, the rapist often has the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family.

[17] Cases of rape by fathers or step fathers appear before the courts in Fiji far too frequently and, in such cases, the starting point should be increased to ten years. Where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances, such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature, threats of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police, there should be substantial increases above that starting point.

[18] In any such case, there are few possible mitigating circumstances beyond a plea of guilty and the sentencing court should be careful to evaluate any matters put forward as suggested mitigation against the family situation. Thus, for example, whilst subsequent concern for, or assistance of, the victim following rape on a stranger may be accepted as some mitigation of the offence, a similar situation in a family rape would do little to mitigate the initial breach of trust. In the present case, the appellant made no attempt to avoid his daughter becoming pregnant and we regard that as a substantial aggravation of the breach of trust.

[19] The appellant pleaded not guilty and then, having put his step daughter through the trauma of giving evidence and being cross examined by him, declined to go into the witness box himself. There was no mitigation.

[20] The learned judge sentenced with these words:

'These were terrible and horrific acts by a father on a girl of extra tender years. She was in class four when you started. ... It was an age when young girls are in the greatest need of security, comfort, understanding and love from their parents but you completely and criminally distorted that role. Instead of giving her love and protection, you made her the target of your lustful desires causing her not only physical pain but unimaginable mental trauma. You used your authority not to protect her but to violate her. You have broken all the rules not only of a father daughter relationship but of civilised human society.

By not pleading guilty ... you also made the girl go through a trial having to repeat and relive those painful vile moments again.'

We endorse those comments.

[21] We consider that the facts of this case merited a sentence of more than eleven years but we do not consider the sentence so manifestly lenient that we should interfere.

[22] The appeals against conviction and sentences are dismissed and the total sentences of eleven years confirmed.

46,774,82092,"SENTENCE

[1] The accused entered pleas of guilty in this Court to the following charges:

Count 1
Statement of Offence

AGGRAVATED ROBBERY: Contrary to section 311(1)(b) of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

PAULIASI YASA on the 6th day of February 2012, at Kulu Bay Resort, Naceva Village, Beqa in the Central Division, robbed LIN JIANG of her wallet valued at $20.00 which contains cash of $60.00 [FJD] and $25.00 [AUSD] all to the total value of $85.00 [FJD] and at the time of the robbery was armed with an offensive weapon namely a cane knife.

Count 2
Statement of Offence

GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 258 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

PAULIASI YASA on the 6th day of February 2012, at Kulu Bay Resort, Naceva Village, Beqa in the Central Division, unlawfully caused grievous harm to YOUYOU WENG by chopping his left wrist with a cane knife.

Count 3
Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(b) of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

PAULIASI YASA on the 6th day of February 2012, at Kulu Bay Resort, Naceva Village, Beqa in the Central Division, raped LIN JIANG by inserting his fingers into the anus and vagina of LIN JIANG without her consent.

[2] On agreement to an appropriate set of facts, he was found guilty of and convicted of each of these counts.

[3] The facts of the case are that a young Australian married couple came to Fiji for a holiday in February 2012 and were staying at Kulu Bay Resort, Beqa. On the 6th February 2012 at 7.30pm they were in their bure when the accused forced his way into their room through the sliding glass door. He was armed with a cane knife and demanded money. The only cash the couple had was made up of F$60 and Aus$25 and they offered this to the accused. The accused told the husband that he was going to take his wife away and the husband of course strongly protected her by pulling the wife's hand when suddenly the accused used the cane knife to sever the husband's left hand at the wrist. The accused then pulled the wife out of the bure where he tore her clothes off and took her into the bush. The wife was naked and the accused fondled her body and put his fingers in both her anus and vagina.

The Law

[4] The maximum penalties for these offences are –

(i) aggravated robbery : 20 years

(ii) grievous harm : 15 years

(iii) rape : life imprisonment

[5] Since February 2010, rape in this jurisdiction includes invasion of anus or vagina with finger(s) as well as the penis or an object. The Court of Appeal has in Kasim CA 21 of 1993 said the tariff for rape of an adult victim must be at least 7 years. This term is to be adjusted upwards for any aggravating feature such as breach of trust, deceitful obtaining of consent for example.

[6] The Supreme Court has set the tariff for aggravated robbery to be between six and fourteen years and numerous recent cases have set a term of at least 10 years to be appropriate (Rasaqio HAC155/07, Rokonabete HAC118/07 and Vasuca HAC41 of 2009L).

[7] This Court suggested in Patel HAA030 of 2011L that the tariff for grievous harm should be between two years and six years.

Mitigation

[8] Counsel for the accused submits that the accused is aged 41 and single. He was educated in Australia and in Fiji and was resident in Australia prior to being brought back to be tried for this case. He has had a history of substance abuse (marijuana).

[9] Counsel submits that there was no reason whatsoever for this evening of atrocious barbarism apart from the fact that his history of drug abuse may have ""contributed in limiting his ability to maintain self control."" He submits that his client, although serving a four year sentence for robbery is to be regarded as a first offender because he has never been convicted before for rape or for grievous harm.

[10] Such a submission is rather surprising. Detail of an offender's previous record is not for the purposes of meting out additional punishment if he has committed the same crime before; it is to prove for or against the instant offender whether he is of good character or not. A person with a completely clear record will be afforded some discount in regard to that fact because the presumption must be that he has never come to the attention of the authorities before and is therefore of good character. If he is convicted of rape but has a previous for robbery then he cannot claim the benefit of a clear record and it is irrelevant whether he has been convicted before of rape or not. This present accused having two previous convictions which are ""alive"" cannot claim any discount for a clear record.

[11] The accused has been in remand for 7 months awaiting trial, prior to the sentence he is serving, and he certainly will be given credit for that period.

[12] Mr. Savou submits that his client has entered a plea to the charges which releases the victims from what would have been an unimaginable ordeal of giving evidence on this matter and although the plea was not at an early opportunity he will receive credit for it.

[13] Counsel submits that the accused is deeply remorseful for his actions and indeed that could be noticed in Court by his demeanour.

Aggravating Features

[14] There can be no greater aggravation to these crimes than the fact that the victims were tourists to this country. Tourists on holiday in a country that is touted world-wide as the ultimate friendly experience, should have the reasonable expectation of safety within their hotel or guesthouse rooms. Anything less than that expectation would be devastating to what is now Fiji's major source of foreign income.

[15] As a result the Courts will visit offenders against tourists with very severe sentences indeed and the message to would-be offenders is that there is zero tolerance of such crime.

[16] In a Victim Impact Report the husband has claimed that with the loss of his hand he faces an uncertain employment future and driving a vehicle and physical interaction with his children is also problematic. He cannot get the incident out of his head.

[17] Similarly the victim wife has recurrent nightmares and a new found fear of men of Pacific Island appearance. Of great concern to her is that normal marital relations with her husband have been affected and she is receiving counseling in this regard.

[18] These victim impact reports are extremely useful in confirming what has always been the perceived wisdom that nighttime invasions of property and particularly nighttime rape (and in unknown overgrown outside areas) can have momentous and everlasting effects on a victim's psyche. Regard to that must be had in sentencing.

[19] It is further aggravating that the victims were in an environment that they were not familiar with and away from their usual support groups. In particular the wife was dragged ""into the bush"" before being sexually assaulted.

Analysis

[20] Given the atrocity of these crimes and the absence of any real explanation for their commission, this Court ordered that the accused be psychiatrically examined. He underwent two examinations on 7 December 2012 and on 25 February 2013. The first report of the first examination states that there was no evidence of a current mental disorder yet a recommendation was made that he be admitted to St. Giles Hospital for further prolonged examination. The second report is consequent to that admission. The Consultant Psychiatrist opined that the accused did not display any evidence of a current mental disorder and that in his current mental state he does not ""need hospital care, treatment and (sic) rehabilitation.""

[21] Given those reports, I accepted the accused's pleas as unequivocal and proceeded to conviction and sentence.

[22] In sentencing for these offences it would be proper to pass separate but heavy sentences for each offence but in light of the three offences being founded on the same facts and to reflect the enormity of the malfeasance, I pass an aggregate sentence on the accused pursuant to section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

[23] I give great weight to the serious aggravating features referred to above (paras 14 to 19) and I also allow for the time the accused has spent in custody in respect of this offence before being convicted and serving a sentence for robbery. I allow discount for his plea of guilty and for his remorse.

[24] I sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment of 15 years, and he shall serve a minimum term of 13 years before being eligible for parole.

[25] This sentence will be served concurrently with the term(s) of imprisonment he is already serving and I note that it does not exceed the total term of 15 years which I would have otherwise passed for the robbery (with the rape and grievous harm being concurrent).

[1] The Appellant was charged with one count of rape contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(a) of the Crimes Decree 2009 and one count of defilement contrary to section 215(1) of the Crimes Decree. The particulars of the rape charge were that the Appellant on 3 September 2010 at Narocake Village Nausori had carnal knowledge of the complainant without her consent. The particulars of the defilement charge were that the Appellant on 25 November 2010 at Narocake Village Nausori had unlawful carnal of the complainant being above the age of 13 years and below the age of 16 years.
 
 
[2] The Appellant pleaded not guilty. Following a trial in the High Court at Suva before a Judge sitting with three assessors, the assessors returned majority opinions of guilty in respect of the rape charge and unanimous opinions of guilty in respect of the defilement charge. The learned trial Judge agreed with both the majority opinions of guilty on the rape charge and the unanimous guilty opinions on the defilement charge and convicted the Appellant on both charges. On 18 May 2012 the Appellant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for the rape conviction and 4 years imprisonment for the defilement conviction to be served concurrently with a non-parole term of 10 years.
 
 
[3] The Appellant filed a notice of appeal against sentence on 22 June 2012. However the Appellant’s handwritten notice was dated 13 June 2012. The version typed by the Corrections Office is dated 14 June 2012. Therefore although the notice was filed four days out of time, the Appellant had complied with section 26(1) of the Court of Appeal Act and could not be held responsible for the delay in filing. The appeal against sentence is to be regarded as timely.
 
 
[4] By notice dated 25 February 2013 the Appellant sought to amend his notice of appeal by adding grounds of appeal against conviction and by amending his grounds of appeal against sentence. The notice of appeal against conviction was, as a result, some 8 months out of time. Although there is no formal application for an enlargement of time to appeal conviction; the material filed by the Appellant will be regarded as such an application.
 
 
[5] By notice of motion dated 1 July 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to adduce fresh evidence at the trial. The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 27 June 2014 by Peniame Roligalevu.
 
 
[6] The Appellant subsequently filed two notices of further amended grounds of appeal against conviction and sentence on 5 September 2014 and 17 June 2016. Both parties filed written submissions on the grounds of appeal against conviction and sentence. Neither party has addressed the issue of an enlargement of time for the appeal against conviction.
 
 
[7] The application for leave to adduce fresh evidence under section 28 of the Act is an application that can only be considered by the Court of Appeal if leave to appeal has been granted. In this jurisdiction the application for leave to adduce fresh evidence is usually heard at the same time as the appeal itself. There is no jurisdiction given to a judge of the Court under section 35(1) of the Act to hear an application made under section 28 of the Act.
 
 
[8] The application for an enlargement of time to file an appeal against conviction is made under section 26(1) of the Act and comes before a judge of the Court of Appeal pursuant to section 35(1) of the Act.
 
 
[9] The principles to be considered when an appellate court is called upon to determine an application for an enlargement of time were considered by the Supreme Court in Rasuku and Another –v- The State (CAV 9 and 13 of 2012; 24 April 2013). In the course of its judgment the Supreme Court affirmed that the factors that should be considered in the exercise of the discretion to enlarge time included those that were discussed in its earlier decision in Sinu and Kumar –v- The State ([2012] FJSC 17; CAV 1 of 2009; 21 August 2012). They are (a) the length of the delay, (b) the reason for the delay, (c) whether there is a ground of merit justifying the appellate court’s consideration or, where there has been substantial delay, nonetheless is there a ground of appeal that will probably succeed and (d) if time is enlarged, will the respondent be unfairly prejudiced.
 
 
[10] As already noted the delay is just over 8 months. Since Counsel did not address the issue there is no material before the Court to explain the delay. In view of the substantial delay it is necessary to determine whether there is a ground of appeal against conviction that is likely to succeed. The grounds of appeal against conviction are set out in the Notice filed on 17 June 2016 at follows:
 
 
“1. THAT the composition of the assessors was unfair as there was two(2) female and one(10 male whilst the complainant was a female.
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in the law by failing to clearly direct and define to the assessors during summing up the respective roles of the Judge and the assessors in respect to the case in the trial.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by failing to adequately put to the assessors all the necessary elements that must be proven for the count of rape by the prosecution as follows:
  
• (a) at paragraph 17 lines 2 and 3, the Learned Trial Judge failed to direct the assessors in summing up what carnal knowledge, or unlawful sexual intercourse means;
 
 
• (b) at paragraph 17 lines 5, 6 and 7, the Learned Trial Judge failed to direct the assessors in summing up that the unlawfulness of the physical act of intercourse must be proved and not just the act;
 
 
• (c) at paragraph 18, the Learned Trial Judge failed to direct the assessors in summing up what consent entails and what threats or intimidation alluded to mean; an 
 
 
• (d) at paragraph 19, the Learned Trial Judge’s direction was insufficient for the assessors to understand knowledge of the Appellant that the complainant did not consent, or recklessness of the Appellant as to whether the complainant consented.
 

 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by failing to adequately put to the assessors all the necessary elements that must be proven for the count of defilement by the prosecution as follows –
  
• (a) at paragraph 21, the Learned Trial Judge failed to direct the assessors in summing up what unlawful sexual intercourse means in the context of the offence of defilement as opposed to the offence of rape;
 
 
• (b) at paragraph 21, the Learned Trial Judge misdirected the assessors in summing up that the unlawfulness of the sexual intercourse is the penetration of the complainant’s vagina with the Appellant’s penis; and
 
 
• (c) at paragraph 24, the Learned Trial Judge misdirected the assessors in summing up that the real issue the assessors to consider is whether the Appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant.
 

 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to put to the Appellant the right to election on the second Count of defilement as to whether it should be trial in the Magistrate or High Court.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by failing to direct the assessor in summing up that the prosecution must prove that the complainant did physically resist and/or she was forced to have sexual intercourse with Appellant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct the assessors in summing up that in order to be convicted on Count 2, the prosecution must prove intention.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in misdirecting the assessors when he stated at page 2 paragraph 4 line 4-5 of the summing up that “each element of the charge must be proved but not every element of the story”.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct the assessors in summing up at paragraph 27 that the fact that the complainant was scared does not prove or mean that the complainant’s fear was caused by the Appellant’s threats or intimidation to submit to the sexual acts, for fear of bodily injury as directed in paragraph 18.”
 

[11] Ground 1 raises the issue of the composition of the assessors in so far as gender is concerned. It is claimed that, since the complainant was female and 2 of the assessors were female, prejudice ensured. Pursuant to section 224(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 the learned trial Judge was required to ask the accused either personally or through his counsel if there was any objection to the selected assessors. There is no material presently before the Court to indicate that an objection had been taken by the Appellant’s counsel or that any such objection had not been properly considered in accordance with section 224(3) of the Criminal Procedure Decree. This ground is not likely to succeed.
 
 
[12] Ground 2 alleges a failure by the learned Judge to direct the assessors on the respective roles of the trial judge and the assessors. The directions given in paragraphs 1 – 3 in relation to the respective roles of the judge and assessors are proper and sufficient. However leave is not required on a ground that involves a question of law only.
 
 
[13] Ground 3 raises an issue concerning the adequacy of the directions given to the assessors on the elements of rape. The directions given in paragraphs 16 to 20 of the summing up clearly explain the elements of rape and there is nothing further that could have been said. This ground raises a question of law only for which leave is not required.
 
 
[14] Ground 4 raises an issue concerning the adequacy of the directions given to the assessors on the elements of defilement under section 215(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. In my judgment the directions given to the assessors in paragraphs 21 to 24 of the summing are again proper and clearly explains what is required of the prosecution to establish the offence of defilement under section 215(1) of the Crimes Decree. This ground involves a question of law alone. Leave is not required under section 21(1) (a) of the Act. 
 
 
[15] Ground 5 raise the issue of a right to election to be tried in the Magistrate Court for the offence of defilement. It is only necessary to indicate that the offence of defilement is a summary offence under section 215(1) of the Crimes Decree. Under section 4(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedures Decree the right of the accused to elect is given only in relation to offences that are indictable but triable summarily. The power given to a magistrate to transfer a summary offence to the High Court is set out in section 188 and 191 of the Procedure Decree. 
 
 
[16] Ground 6 raises an issue concerning consent. The Appellant alleges that the learned Judge should have directed the assessors to the effect that the prosecution must prove that the complainant did physically resist and/or that she was forced to have sexual intercourse with the Appellant. This ground can be considered with ground 9 which also raises the issue of consent. The issue of consent so far as was necessary for this trial was properly discussed by the trial Judge in paragraph 18 of his summing up and was consistent with the definition of consent in section 206(2) of the Crimes Decree 2009. These grounds are not likely to succeed.
 
 
[17] Ground 7 raises an issue concerning the directions given by the trial Judge to the assessors on the offence of defilement. The Appellant claims that there was no reference to the requirement to prove intention. Under the Crimes Decree the term that is now used is fault element. Fault element includes intention and under section 19(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 a person has intention with respect to conduct if he means to engage in that conduct. It was not suggested by the Appellant that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant but did not intend to do so. The defence was that the two incidents did not take place. The defence did not raise the issue of mistake as to the age of the complainant. This ground is not likely to succeed.
 
 
[18] Ground 8 claims that the Judge had erred when he told the assessors that “each element of the charge must be proved but not every element of the story.”  The quotation in the grounds of appeal is incorrect. In paragraph 4 of the summing up in the second last sentence the learned Judge explained that:
 
“Each element of the charge must be proved but not every fact of the story.”
There is no inconsistency in this statement nor are the observations inappropriate or prejudicial. This ground is not likely to succeed.
 
 
[19] In conclusion the grounds of appeal against conviction are unlikely to succeed and as a result the application for an enlargement of time is refused. Furthermore I have concluded that the grounds of appeal against conviction are vexatious and the appeal against conviction is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Act.
 
 
[20] The test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether the Appellant has established that there has been an arguable error by the trial Judge in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. The grounds of appeal against sentence are:
 
 
“10. THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to clearly state the aggravating facts that he is referring to whilst enhancing the sentence by five(5) years from the starting point of ten (10) years.
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to use any guideline judgment to assist him in picking the starting point of sentencing.
 
 
• THAT the sentence was unlawful as it was passed in consequence of an error of law.”
 

[21] The first ground relates to aggravating factors. Although they have not he specifically listed in one paragraph, they are identified throughout the sentencing decision. They have been clearly stated. The five years added for aggravating factors does not constitute an arguable error by the judge in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
 
 
[22] Ground 2 claims that the judge failed to state any authority for his selection of ten years as a starting point for determining the head sentence. The starting point is consistent with current sentencing practices in Fiji for the offence of rape of a child by an accused who is a family member, albeit the extended family. The starting point is consistent with the authority of Drotini v The State to which the learned Judge referred in his sentencing decision. There has been no error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
 
 
[23] So far in ground 3 is concerned, the Appellant has failed to identify the alleged error of law.
 
 
[24] In my judgment leave to appeal should be refused and the appeal against sentence dismissed under section 35(2) of the Act as being vexatious.
 
 
 Orders:
  
• Application for enlargement of time to appeal conviction is refused
 
 
• Appeal against conviction is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act.
 
 
• Application for leave to appeal sentence is refused.
 
 
• Appeal against sentence is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act.

[1] Setero Seru, you stand convicted of two counts of sexual assaults contrary to section 210(1)(a) of the Crimes Decree of 2009. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

[2] The offences were committed between 10 February 2010 and 13 July 2011 at Qeleni village in Taveuni. The offences involve the same victim. At the time of the first assault, the victim was a 9-year old student. 

[3] On both occasions, you enticed the victim into a vacant house and got her undressed. You used your penis to stroke the victim’s vagina until you ejaculated. After the incident, you threatened her not to report to anyone. In the second incident, you touched the victim’s vagina and stroked your penis on her anus until you ejaculated. The second incident was witnessed by your brother who then reported the incident to the victim’s grandfather. On 15 July 2011, you were arrested and interviewed under caution. You confessed to the sexual assaults. You were charged and you remained in custody after the court refused you bail.

[4] Later, you challenged the voluntariness of your confession but it was ruled admissible after a voir dire hearing. 

[5] Your trial was set to commence on 7 May 2012. On the day of the trial, you pleaded guilty. The timing of your guilty plea leads me to conclude that you have the full realization of the strength of the evidence you faced. The weight that I attach to your guilty plea is based on saving court time and resources and relieving the victim from giving evidence of sexual nature. Your guilty plea is not a reflection of remorse. 

[6] You are 35 years old and single. You have attained up to class-8 education. After leaving school you have spent most of your adult life farming. 

[7] You are not a stranger to the criminal justice system. On 23 April 2002, Pathik J sentenced you to a total sentence of 6 years imprisonment after you pleaded guilty to three counts of unnatural offences (State v Seru [2002] FJHC 197: HAM0001J.2001B (23 April 2002). Those offences were also committed in Taveuni. The victims were boys aged 7, 8 and 9 respectively. They were sodomized by you. In sentencing you, Pathik J stated:

“A person indulging in this animal-like behavior has to be put away from society for a long time as a deterrent to others minded to act in the manner the accused did.”

[8] I bear in mind that your previous conviction was for sodomy. In the present case, you did not penetrate but you stroked your penis on the victim’s vagina and anus until you ejaculated. Conduct of this nature is equally serious and must be denounced and deterred. 

[9] Sexual assault is a new offence under the Crimes Decree and there is no guideline judgment for this offence. The only other case known to this Court in which the offender was sentenced for sexual assault is State v Semi Naulu Criminal Case No HAC041/10Lab). In that case, the offender was an elderly man with previous good character and was suffering from physical disability. He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, after pleading guilty to an act of licking the vagina of a 12-year old girl. 

[10] In the present case, the victim is of a much tender age. I had an opportunity to see the victim when she attended court for trial. The victim is a timid little girl when compared with your age and physical built. She was vulnerable when the offences were committed. The offences were repeated over a period of 12 months. The sexual assaults were followed by threats to discourage the victim from complaining. These factors aggravated the offences.

[11] The nature and the circumstances of the offences you have committed lead me to conclude that you are a pedophile. You prey on children of a very tender age. Your method of committing the sexual assaults is similar. Past prison sentence has not deterred you. You reoffended after serving 6 years in prison. You are a threat to the community because the likelihood of you reoffending is real. 

[12] After having regard to your antecedent and character and the nature of the offences, I declare you to be a habitual offender pursuant to section 11 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 

[13] The primary purpose of sentence that applies to you is the protection of the community. There is a need to incarcerate you for a long period of time to protect our children from sexual abuse. 

[14] Sexual offences against children are almost becoming an epidemic in our country. It shows a decay of the moral fabric of our society. Repeat offenders of sexual crime against children should expect to be isolated from the society for a long period of time until they pause no threat to the community. 

[15] For each count, I use 5 years as my starting point and I add 4 years to reflect the aggravating factors. I reduce 2 years for the guilty plea and 1 year for the remand period. The sentence is 6 years imprisonment on each count and I fix a non-parole period of 5 years. 

[16] The two offences are separate episodes of sexual assaults. Although the same victim is involved, the offences are separated by 1-year time gap. To achieve the purpose of sentence that applies in this case, I order the sentences to be served consecutively. The total sentence is 12 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years.

[17] I recommend you undergo counselling in prison as a measure of rehabilitation.

The accused pleaded guilty to 1 count of criminal trespass contrary to Section 387(1) (b) of the Crimes Decree No.: 44 of 2009, and to one count of Indecent Assault contrary to Section 212 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

After admitting the summary of facts the accused was convicted of the said offences of criminal trespass and indecent assault.

The brief facts of this case which were admitted by the accused were, on 29/8/2010 at about 10.30am the accused entered into the complainant's house. Complainant was alone in the house lying down on the bed. She felt someone touch her from behind, and when she sat on the bed she saw accused. Accused asked her why she fought with the sister.

Before she could explain, accused pushed her back on the bed, with one hand he held her neck, and with the other hand he tried to remove her undergarment and spread her legs.

Then complainant managed to bang on the wall of her house and shouted to attract attention of the neighbours. The accused then got off her and left the house. The complainant was 21 years old at the time of the incident.

Maximum sentence for the offence of Indecent Assault is 5 years imprisonment.
Sentences for Indecent Assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years (Rokota v State [2002] FJHC168; HAA 0068J. 2002S [23 August 2002] ).

Justice Shameem giving guidance on the tariff for Indecent Assault cases said in Rokota v State (Supra) case:

""..........Sentences for indecent assault ranges from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.

These are the general principles which affect sentencing under Section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff, although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate. A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.

The aggravating factors in this case are:

The accused committed this offence inside the house of complainant while she was sleeping. Her own house where she lived would be the place, where the victim complainant would have felt safest.

When offending, the accused tried to remove her undergarment and tried to spread her legs. He further held her neck using violence, so that she couldn't have shouted to alarm the neighbours.

The mitigating factors are:

The accused is 25 years old, married with two young children aged 5 years and 1 year. He is the sole bread winner of the family. Accused pleaded guilty saving time of court, and specially being a sexual offence, saving the victim from the trauma of giving evidence in court.

Counsel for accused informed that accused had sought forgiveness from the complainant.

Accused is a first offender. He is remorseful and promises not to re-offend.

For the charge of Indecent Assault, considering the above circumstances I take 2 years imprisonment as starting point.

I add another 2 years imprisonment for the aggravating factors and deduct 2 years imprisonment for the mitigating factors mentioned above on behalf of the accused making a total of 2 years imprisonment.

I further deduct 8 months for his early plea of guilty and another 4 months for his previous good behavior making his final sentence to 12 months imprisonment.

Considering the facts of the case, and that this was not a case of fleeting type Indecent Assault, I find it does not warrant a non-custodial sentence.

Maximum sentence for Criminal Trespass is imprisonment for 1 year where the offence was committed in any building used as a human dwelling.

Tariff for the offence of Criminal Trespass is 1 month – 9 months (Ravuwai v State [2007] FJAC 55).

Considering the above aggravating factors and all what was said on behalf of the accused in mitigation, I sentence the accused to 3 months imprisonment for the count of Criminal Trespass.

Final Sentence
Count of Criminal Trespass – 3 months imprisonment.
Count of Indecent Assault – 1 year imprisonment.

Sentences on both counts to run concurrently.

30 days to appeal.

50,778,80366,"JUDGMENT

On the 31st December 2003, the appellant appeared before the Nadi Magistrates Court and was charged with 3 counts of incest. The charges read as follows:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

INCEST BY MALE: Contrary to sections 178(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

BABU RAM s/o Bhawant a male person, between January 2001 and December 2002 at Barara, Nadi in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of SHEETAL SWANGANI DEVI whom he knew was his daughter and was under the age of 13 years.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

INCEST BY MALE: Contrary to sections 178(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

BABU RAM s/o Bhawant a male person, on the 4th day of June 2003 at Barara, Nadi in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of SHEETAL SWANGANI DEVI whom he knew was his daughter and was aged 13 years and 2 months.

THIRD COUNT

Statement of Offence

INCEST BY MALE: Contrary to sections 178(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

BABU RAM s/o Bhawant a male person, on the 23rd day of December 2003 at Barara, Nadi in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of SHEETAL SWANGANI DEVI whom he knew was his daughter and was aged 13 years and 8 months.

The appellant pleaded guilty to the 2nd and 3rd counts and not guilty to the 1st count. 

The Learned Magistrate convicted the appellant and sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment on each of counts 2 and 3, such sentences to be served concurrently.

On 29 January 2004, the appellant pleaded guilty to count 1 and the Learned Magistrate sentenced the accused to 6 years imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on counts 2 and 3.

The facts put to the court in respect to count 2 are that on 4 June 2003 at about 9.00am, the accused was having sexual intercourse with his daughter, Sheetal in his bedroom when his son, Rajeshwar Ram, returned from the neighbour’s house and tried to find his sister, Sheetal. He went to a room and opened the door to check on her and he saw his father having sexual intercourse with the victim. When the accused saw his son, he jumped out of bed and pulled his trousers up. The son, Rajeshwar ran out and went to his brother, Shiu, whose house was nearby and told his sister-in-law. She later told her husband and her mother-in-law.

They did not take action and did not tell the police at that time but watched both of them from then on.

The facts with respect to the third count are that on 23 December 2003, the accused had sexual intercourse with the victim at his home. The daughter-in-law of the accused, Joytika Devi, returned from the neighbour’s place and heard loud music coming from the house of her father-in-law and she went in from the back door and saw the accused having sexual intercourse with the victim, Sheetal. The accused jumped out of bed and pulled his pants up.

At 1300 hours, the son of the accused returned from shopping and his wife, Joytika Devi, told him what she had seen and the matter was reported to Sabeto Police Station. When interviewed, the appellant admitted the offence.

The facts with respect to the first count as put to the court are that between January 2001 and December 2001, the accused had sexual intercourse with the victim on numerous occasions. She was in class 3 and he tried to have sexual intercourse with her but could not penetrate her vagina. The following year, 2001 she was in class 4 when he had sexual intercourse with her and his penis penetrated her vagina. Since then he continuously had sexual intercourse with her during 2001 and 2002.

The appellant is 56 years of age and he is a labourer. He is married with children and grand children.

In his sentencing remarks with respect to counts 2 and 3, the Learned Magistrate said: -

“I note that the maximum sentence under section 178(1) of the Penal Code is 7 years imprisonment and up to life if the child is under 13 years of age.”

Section 178(1) was amended by Act No. 7 of 2003 and the relevant maximum penalty was increased to 20 years imprisonment.

Prior to the amendment, it was considered that sentences of between 5 years and 3 years would be appropriate depending upon the aggravating and mitigating factors – State v Viliame Tamani – HAC0007 of 2003S.

It would seem that this range should now be between 15 years and 9 years. If 15 years is taken as a starting point and one-third reduction is given for the early plea of guilty and the resultant sentence is 10 years. The aggravating factors including the period of time over which the offences were committed justify increasing the penalty to 12 years imprisonment. As the offences in counts 2 and 3 are part of an ongoing offence, it is appropriate that the sentences be concurrent, with a resultant sentence on counts 2 and 3 of 12 years.

Count 1 was committed when the victim was under 13 years of age and accordingly, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.

Whilst in The State v Viliame Tamani – HAC0007.2003S, it was suggested that the term of 6 years would be appropriate in these circumstances as I have said earlier, that decision does not take account of the increase in penalties by virtue of Act No. 7 of 2003 and therefore, I think penalties in the range of 10 to 14 years would now be appropriate.

The plea of guilty was very late and the aggravation is grave as the offence spans a period of 2 years and accordingly, a term of imprisonment for 12 years is appropriate.

This offence appears to be part of a continuing offence with counts 2 and 3 and accordingly, it is appropriate that the sentence be concurrent with the sentence imposed for those counts.

The result is that the sentence of 12 years imprisonment is appropriate but for the reasons stated which differ from those of the Learned Magistrate.

The appellant also appealed against conviction on the basis that the plea was equivocal.

The record of the court indicates that the plea was in fact unequivocal and when the questions and answers detailed in the court record, were put to the appellant, he acknowledged them to be correct. In the circumstances, there appears no basis on which the plea is equivocal.

The appeal is dismissed.

51,779,255838,"JUDGMENT
 
 
Gates, J
On 29 November 2000 the Appellant was convicted on his own plea of guilty of three offences before a Resident Magistrate sitting at Lautoka. He was sentenced as follows:
 
 
Count 1 Burglary 2 years imprisonment
 
Count 2 Act with Intent to Cause 5 years imprisonment
 
 Grievous Harm 
 
Count 3 Attempted Rape 4 years imprisonment 
 
 
The offences were alleged to have taken place on 14th November 2000. The complainant was a 39 year old female missionary of the Lautoka Community Church. Her husband, also a missionary, was away in New Zealand for 3 weeks on ministerial business. That night the Complainant and her 3 children went to sleep on the Complainant's bed. Her home was locked. The Appellant aged 1 7 lived next door with his parents. Earlier in the evening he had been drinking gin. He gained entry through the Complainant's bathroom window. He said in his caution interview statement which was tendered to the court that he was outside in the street after 11.15pm and decided ""to enter (the Complainant's) house and to steal something."" He said further ""I went to the bedroom where (the Complainant) was sleeping on bed with her children. ....As soon as I saw (the Complainant) sleeping in such a way, I got tempted and changed my mind to have sex with (her). .. ..I went to her and banged her shoulder. I told her in Hindustani that I love you - I want to have sex with her. She screamed for help and I tried to stop her and in the process as I got hold of piece of iron rod with handle from headrest of bed and whilst stopping her from yelling, the iron rod suddenly hit her on the face.""
 
 
In contrast the Complainant said she had also been punched by the Appellant several times on the chest (not stomach, as put to the Magistrate) and on the face.
 
 
The Complainant's statement was not made available to the Magistrate, but one significant part was omitted from the facts. It was this. When, by a subterfuge, the Complainant managed to escape to the kitchen, she was able to put on the light. By this light she recognised her neighbour's son, the Appellant. She added ""As soon as this man saw blood oozing from my face. he started apologising, saying he was sorry that he hurt me, and said that he did not mean to hurt me"". This instantaneous expression of remorse was an important matter to be taken into account when sentence was being considered. It should have been included in the facts of the Investigating Officer who had failed to include it in his ""Brief Facts"" in the police dockets which were tendered. It is the duty of the police prosecutor or State Counsel to ensure that facts significant to the sentencing process are brought to the Court's attention. Where an Accused is unrepresented and faces very serious charges, the court needs to be able to rely on the relevance, accuracy and fairness of the prosecutor's facts as put up to the court. The observations of Grant CJ in R v Panapasa Silosomo (1976) 22 Fiji LR 84 at p 86B apply equally 10 trial and to guilty plea proceedings.
 
 
The Appellant led her two sons back to the bedroom, they had followed their mother in tears to the kitchen. The Complainant then ran out of the back door and screamed for help. She was very distressed. She received further injuries when trying to climb over the barbed wire fence. The Appellant ran off to a cassava patch where he spent the night. He gave himself up in the morning and made a full confession of his deeds to the police.
 
 
The Complainant was examined that night at Lautoka Hospital She was observed to be ""very distressed"". She had a laceration on the left maxillary prominence, which on later x-ray was found to be fractured. There was considerable bleeding from this injury. She was bleeding from both nostrils. She had a black eye injury to the right eye, with swollen red eyeball. She had bruises with skin torn off on her right elbow. She had skin torn off 2 areas on the front of the right knee. There was a blunt injury on her chest wall. It was necessary to have the laceration on the left maxillary, which was a deep gash, stitched. The doctors noted this injury would give rise to a permanent facial scar. The Magistrate was assisted by a helpful counseling report on the Complainant her husband, and family.
 
 
It was not clear where the file (the weapon) had come from. The Appellant claimed it was by the bedhead. It must have caused the deep gash, the most serious of the injuries.
 
 
At the time of the plea the Appellant was not represented. From 27 November 2000 onwards he was provided with legal aid counsel, who mitigated for him prior to sentence being passed. The court had the benefit also of a probation officer's report.
 
 
At the appeal hearing I gave leave for the filing of an amended Petition of Appeal. This should have been filed by the Respondent ""not later than three days before the date fixed for the hearing of the appeal..."" [section 311(4) of the CPC] so that the Deputy Registrar could comply with section 314(e) of the CPC and ""serve notice of such filing and supply the Respondent with a copy of the document containing such additional grounds of appeal"". I indicated I would allow Ms Fagbenro for the Respondent further time to reply if she were embarrassed by the late filing. In the event, she did not require further time. However it is important for counsel to bear in mind, the filing of additional grounds should be done in good time to allow, in fairness, for a full response from their opponents. The cost of an adjournment of an appeal if necessary may have to be borne by an Appellant in such cases [section 317 CPC].
 
 
An additional affidavit was filed on the day of the hearing, to which the Respondent took exception. It contained no significantly new matter and I disallow it now for the purposes of consideration of the appeal.
 
 
It was clear from the submissions of counsel for the Appellant that the appeal narrowed down to two main grounds. Those grounds were, that the pleas of guilty were equivocal, and that the sentence was too harsh and excessive. There were other grounds arising from the Amended Petition and I shall deal with some of those that have significance for this judgment.
 
 
Amendment of the Charge bv the Magistrate
 
 
It was said that the learned Magistrate had erred in advising the prosecution to add a new charge of attempted rape [Count 3], and in advising and allowing the amendment of the burglary charge [Count 1]. I set out the relevant part of section 214 of the CPC.
 
 
It reads:
 
 
""214. - (1) Where, at any stage of the trial before the close of the case for the prosecution, it appears to the court that the charge is defective, either in substance or inform, the court may make such order for the alteration of the charge, either by way of amendment of the charge or by the substitution or addition of a new charge, as the court thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case:
 
 
Provided that—
 
 
(a) where a charge is altered as aforesaid the court shall thereupon call upon the accused person to plead to the altered charge.""
 
 
It would appear the Magistrate considered the charge of attempted rape an appropriate addition based on the facts of the case as put to him by the prosecutor. Additionally he considered that the count of burglary should be amended from an intent to commit rape to an intent to commit burglary. On the material before him this seemed also appropriate. In view of the duties cast on the Magistrate by section 214, the Magistrate's action in advising amendment and in allowing it in both instances was unremarkable and correct. The Magistrate has noted in the record that he explained the amendment of the charges to the Appellant. He also noted that a fresh plea was taken on Counts 1 and 3 after those counts were read to the Appellant in their new7 or amended form. Count 2 along with Counts 1 and 3 was not put again, that is the entire charge sheet was not put so that fresh pleas could be taken.
 
 
In Attorney-General v Parmanandam [1968] 14 Fiji LR 6 Hammett CJ said at p23G:
 
 
""It appears to me from the first proviso to this subsection that where a charge is altered it is mandatory for the Court to call upon the accused to plead to the altered charge.""
 
 
His lordship commented at p 24 D:
 
 
""If however the 3rd Count was in fact amended, I am of the opinion that the failure to take the accused's plea to the amended charge was a fatal and incurable defect in respect of the 3rd Count in the proceedings in the Court below in these circumstances.""
 
 
For other reasons, his lordship ordered that the acquittal on Counts 1 & 3 should stand. However the conviction on Count 2 was to stand also. In the same year the Court of Appeal were called upon on two occasions to consider the meaning of the word ""charge"". In Hari Pratap v R [1968] 14 Fiji LR 93 at p 97D the Court said of the section equivalent to the present section 214:
 
 
""The Criminal Procedure Code does not define the word ""charge"" but it is obvious that the question of the construction of section 204 (1) must be approached in the light of the earlier sections quoted, which show that a charge is something which contains statements of the sum total of the offences which are intended, to be tried together."" (emphasis added)
 
 
and at p 97F:
 
 
""But in any event the addition of a new charge, in the sense a section 121, would not be the ""alteration"" of an existing charge. Therefore if ""addition of a new charge"", is to have any meaning at all, it must be read as ""addition of a new count."" The question is whether that consideration entitles the court to construe the word ""charge"" as ""count"" where it appears in proviso (a) to the section.""
 
 
The Court of Appeal disagreed with the learned Chief Justice's careful reasoning in the High Court and gave their reasons for doing so at p 98 C:
 
 
""Where there is only one offence contained in a charge it may be amended by a change in its own wording, the substitution of another offence or the addition of one or more counts. We feel that where the learned Chief Justice refers to ""a charge, consisting of one count charging an offence"" he visualizes it being amended only in its particulars or by substitution. Then the direction to call upon the accused person to plead to the ""altered charge"" can only mean plead to the resultant varied or new charge. But where it is amended by the addition of another count surely the ""altered charge"" is the original charge as altered by the addition. We do not see that any difference arises whether there is only one offence contained in the original charge or whether there are two or more.
 
 
Section 204 clearly embraces in the concept of alteration, variation, substitution and addition. Whichever course is taken it is the original charge which is altered. When you add material to an existing object it is the existing object which is altered — it is not the new material. When you add a count to an existing charge it is not the new count which is altered, but the existing charge. We see no escape from the plain meaning of the words ""altered charge"" in proviso (a) and do not find anything that can be drawn from the one anomaly in the earlier part of the section, of sufficient weight to affect what we consider to be the only possible construction of the proviso.""
 
 
What was the purpose or advantage for such a provision? There were certain advantages for an Accused however in having the whole charge with the additional count put again, which were suggested by the court at p 98 F:
 
 
""It is idle to speculate upon the underlying reason for the provision. Where an accused person has pleaded not guilty to a number of counts in a charge he is at liberty to change his plea to ""guilty"" at any time so the provision offers him no advantage. On the other hand it does appear to afford him the opportunity where he has pleaded ""guilty"" to some counts and ""not guilty"" to others of reversing his plea of ""guilty "". That is just. An accused person has pleaded guilty to counts (a) and (b) and not guilty to counts (c) and (d) of a charge he is surely entitled to reconsider his position if the prosecutor then proposes to add two new counts.""
 
 
The court found that the result of the failure to take the Appellant's plea to the whole charge upon the amendment is that the proceedings thereafter became a nullity. A similar conclusion had been reached in two Nigerian cases: Fox v Commissioner of Police (1947) 12 Selected Judgments of the West African Court of Appeal 215; and Eronini v The Queen (1953) 14 Selected Judgments of the West African Court of Appeal 366.
 
 
The Fiji Court of Appeal found they were unable to agree with the Chief Justice when he concluded that this was an error curable by the application of the proviso. Accordingly grounds (a) and (b) in the appeal before me now, whilst not directly focused on this aspect of amendment, must succeed. I share the reluctance the Court of Appeal expressed at the conclusion which is thus presented. But until such time as section 214 is amended to distinguish between ""the charge"" and ""the individual counts in the charge"" so that proviso (a) of section 214 would require the court to call upon the Accused to plead only to the amended, substituted, or added counts rather than to the full charge containing all of the counts, the present law, as it is must be applied.
 
 
In Sucha Singh v R (1968] 14 Fiji LR 222 the prosecution had applied in the Magistrates' Court to delete from Count 5 the number of a motor vehicle from the particulars. The Court of Appeal held this to be an unnecessary amendment since the charge had given full particulars both before and after the amendment. In these circumstances, the Magistrate was not obliged to call upon the Accused to plead again all of the counts in the charge. Gould VP dissented from that opinion. The view expressed as an alternative by Hutchison JA was that the error was an irregularity only, which could not make the proceedings a nullity. In that case the amendment was trivial and there was no question of a miscarriage of justice. The position in the present case is more grave. The Appellant was a 17 year old of limited schooling without counsel at the time of the amendment and further plea. In addition the additional charge was one of attempted rape, a serious charge, and the amendment to the burglary count also could not be described as trivial. Upon the facts presented it is possible, as was foreshadowed in Hari Pratap (supra) that consideration could have been given by the Appellant's legal advisers to a change in the pleas. A plea of guilty to the burglary and grievous harm counts might have been proffered, and the attempted rape might have been challenged. Deliberations to decide such matters could not be carried out because at the time of the major changes to the charge sheet the Appellant stood alone without the advantage of counsel.
 
 
Ground (c) said the Magistrate had erred in not advising the Appellant, by virtue of the nature of the charges and amendments, to seek legal advice. A Legal Aid Commission counsel was assigned to the Appellant for 27th November 2000, but by then the amendments had been made and fresh pleas to 2 of the counts taken. He may not have been assigned to deal with contested matters, as seems to be the case with the Duty Solicitor Scheme. In mitigation remorse was expressed through the Appellant's counsel for what happened to the Complainant. As has been said so many times before, pleas of guilty amounting to admissions of mere wrongdoing, do not necessarily amount to a full and sound acceptance by an Accused of all of the legal elements of an offence. In mitigation his counsel put forward the following without query from the court:
 
 
""Circumstances show Accused no intention to commit offence and cause serious injury.""
 
 
Wanting to have sex with the Complainant for which he made request, an idea formed on the spur of the moment, does not alone necessarily amount to attempted rape. There are other aspects of this case which are equivocal, not least the expression of immediate remorse, and the cause and purpose of the violent struggle. In his interview his comment on this was:
 
 
""She screamed for help and I tried to stop her""
 
 
It remains to be seen whether he struggled with her to overpower her in order to force her to have sexual intercourse with him, or whether he was trying to quieten her and subdue her for the unsurprising panic reaction when finding a drunken man in her bedroom. In view of the orders to be made, I make no further observations on the evidence. These are trial issues. 
 
 
In Suren Singh & 4 Others v The State (unreported) Suva High Court Cr. App. No. 79 of 2000; 26 October 2000 Shameem J. in interpreting section 28(1)(d) of the Constitution (right to counsel), as well as section 29(1) (right to a fair trial) had this to say (at p 9):
 
 
""For the accused to make an informed choice, he/she must be told of these rights. And, because the failure to communicate these rights, and the absence of proper representation may lead to a finding that a hearing was not fairly conducted, the person responsible for communicating these rights is the Magistrate before whom the accused first appears. Finally, for the right to be communicated at the most meaningful time, it must be explained before the plea is taken.
 
 
For these reasons, I find that the Learned Magistrate should have explained to the Appellants the three-pronged right under section 28(1)(d) of the Constitution before the plea was put to them.""
 
 
Shameem J. set out a recommended format for according these rights. It is worthy of further publication (from p10):
 
 
""For the guidance of Magistrates in the future however I suggest the following format before the plea is taken:
 
 
1. Before you plead to the charge, I must inform you that you have the right to defend yourself, to instruct a lawyer of your own choice, or if you wish, to apply for a lawyer on legal aid.
 
 
2. Do you wish to instruct your own lawyer?
 
 
3. Do you wish to apply for legal aid to the Legal Aid Commission?
 
 
If the answer is no to (2) and (3) then the Magistrate should hear the plea. If the plea is one of ""Guilty"" the Magistrate should ask:
 
 
4. Are you pleading guilty voluntarily or have you been pressured or induced to do so?
 
 
An adherence to the above format may reduce substantially the numbers of appeals filed on the grounds of unfair procedure.""
 
 
The amendments were major not minor. Section 214 was not followed by the putting again of the full charge containing all 3 counts. In addition, prior to plea, the young unrepresented Appellant was not positively informed of his right to counsel. Since these were grave charges, the failure to put the whole charge again rendered the proceedings a nullity. This was not a mere procedural irregularity. Additionally on consideration of the facts adduced, the caution interview statement and the mitigation, I am not satisfied the Appellant has been accorded a fair trial overall. If I had any doubt on the question of nullity. I would find the lesser effect of failing to put the full charge namely procedural irregularity, compounded by the failure to protect the Appellant and to accord him his rights under section 28(1)(d) of the Constitution.
 
 
In the result:
 
 
1. All three convictions are set aside;
 
 
2. All three sentences are quashed;
 
 
3. The case is remitted to the Magistrates' Court for pleas to be taken before a different Magistrate and, if need be trial de novo;
 
 
4. The Appellant is remanded in custody to be produced before the Magistrates' Court Lautoka on 10th August 2001 at 9a.m.
 
 
Appeal succeeds.

52,780,269387,"RULING
 
 
[1] The appellant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment after he was found guilty of rape by the High Court at Lautoka. This is his timely application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on the following grounds: 
 
 
Appeal against Conviction
 
 
1. That the Learned Judge erred in law in failing to declare a mistrial after disqualifying Assessor No. 1 after this person was found talking to the Investigating Officer after the adjournment on 29 March 2012.
 
 
2. That the Learned Judge erred in law in failing to declare a mistrial after discovering a misconduct by Assessor No. 1 who was found talking to the Investigating Officer after the adjournment on 29 March 2012.
 
 
3. That the Learned Judge erred in law in failing to declare a mistrial after disqualifying Assessor No. 1 whose actions brought the court and criminal justice system into disrepute and question.
 
 
4. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to declare a mistrial after disqualifying Assessor No. 1 on the grounds that the other two assessors could be biased or could be seen to be bias and under these circumstances brought the court and the criminal justice system into disrepute and question.
 
 
5. The Learned Judge erred in law in failing to provide a balanced and adequate summing up of the Prosecution evidence that were favourable to the defence and as such there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
6. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not adequately directing the assessors on the significance of the Prosecution witness conflicting evidence during the trial.
 
 
7. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself and or the Assessors on previous inconsistent statements by the Prosecution witnesses.
 
 
8. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by ruling on Voir Dire that the medical report of the Complainant was admissible.
 
 
9. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by not directing the assessors to disregard the evidence of Prosecution Witness Miriama Nadumu when she gave evidence in Court regarding drawing of the plan of the alleged scene of the incident when the said plan was held inadmissible by the Learned Trial Judge.
 
 
10. That the Learned Prosecutor failed to tender in Court the clothes that were worn by the complainant that included her panty because if the allegation was true the panty would have blood stains and by not doing so there was a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
Appeal against Sentence
 
 
1. That the appellant appeals against sentence as it is manifestly harsh, excessive and wrong in principal under the circumstances of the case.
 
 
2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to use proper sentencing guidelines resulting in a sentence which was harsh and excessive.
 
 
3. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not taking into account the age, the medical ground and condition of the Appellant.
 
 
[2] In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant has focused on grounds 1 to 4 only. In respect to grounds 5 to 9, counsel submits that further particulars will be provided upon the receipt of the court record. No submissions have been made in respect to the grounds against sentence. Counsel for the State submits that without the particulars the grounds are inadequate and cannot be considered valid grounds of appeal.
 
 
[3] It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide the particulars of the alleged error so that the opposing party can properly respond to the grounds. The practice of the High Court is to provide written rulings, summing up, judgment and sentence to all the parties involved after the conclusion of the trial. If the alleged error relates to the directions in the summing up, or rulings made by the trial judge in the course of the trial, for instance on admissibility of evidence, the appellant should be able to present grounds with adequate particulars based on the documents provided to him after the conclusion of his trial. The appellant cannot escape his responsibility to provide valid grounds of appeal by saying further particulars will be available upon receipt of the court record. Appellate courts will insist that the appellants provide valid grounds of appeal so that the question of leave can be considered judiciously. 
 
 
[4] Grounds 1 to 4 relate to the trial judge's ruling in which he refused to order a mistrial upon an application by the appellant. The principles governing a mistrial were explained by the High Court of Australia in Crofts v R (1996) 70 AJLR 917 at p 927:
 
 
""No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the state at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial discretion designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledge, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript.""
 
 
[5] In the present case, the trial commenced before the trial judge sitting with three assessors. After the assessors were sworn, the trial was adjourned due to bad weather. When the trial resumed after three days and before any evidence was called, counsel for the appellant moved for one of the assessors to be discharged after she was seen having a conversation with a police witness in the trial. The trial judge called the assessor concerned and made an inquiry with her regarding the alleged conversation. The assessor admitted that she only greeted the witness and there was no further conversation. The trial judge discharged the offending assessor and decided to continue with the trial with the remaining two assessors. This procedure was available under section 225(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009. At that stage, counsel for the appellant supported the trial judge's decision to continue with the trial with the two remaining assessors. 
 
 
[6] After the end of the defence case and before the summing up was delivered, counsel for the appellant changed his position and applied for a mistrial. The basis for the application for a mistrial was that the offending assessor may have had a conversation with the other two remaining assessors about her conversation with the police witness. The trial judge in a detailed ruling rejected the proposed ground for the mistrial saying it was ill founded and misconceived. I agree. The proposed ground for a mistrial was clearly based on speculation and not on evidence. The offending assessor was discharged before any evidence was called. At that stage counsel for the appellant did not see any irregularity. It was only after all the evidence was concluded, counsel for the appellant applied for a mistrial. The trial judge concluded that bringing an application for a mistrial so late was an abuse of process. I agree with this finding. I am satisfied that there was no irregularity in the trial to render the entire process unfair to the appellant for the trial judge to order a mistrial. Grounds 1 to 4 are not arguable. 
 
 
[7] Grounds 5 to 9 lack the necessary particulars to make an assessment whether they are arguable. I consider these grounds to be invalid. 
 
 
[8] Ground 10 relates to physical evidence that was not tendered. Counsel for the appellant submits that the prosecution should have tendered the complainant's underwear because the underwear would have contained blood stains if the allegation was true, and by not producing it in court there was a substantial miscarriage of justice. This ground is not arguable. Firstly, there was no evidence that the complainant's underwear had blood stains. Secondly, if the underwear was not produced as an exhibit, neither the trial judge nor the assessors were entitled to speculate why it was not produced. 
 
 
[9] The appellant's main complaint is that his sentence is excessive given his old age, good character and medical history. At the time of sentencing, the appellant was 66 years old while the victim was 5½ years old. It is not clear if the trial judge was informed of the medical history of the appellant, if he had any. The trial judge in his sentencing remarks noted that although the appellant's good character was a mitigating factor, the serious aggravating circumstances outweighed the appellant's personal circumstances and previous good character.
 
 
[10] The prosecution case against the appellant was strong. The victim was sent to the appellant's home by her mother to borrow some potatoes. They were neigbours. When the victim was late to return home, her mother went to the appellant's home and noticed all the doors were closed but the victim's shoes were outside the house. When the victim's mother knocked at the door, the appellant opened it. The victim came out crying and told her mother that the appellant had poked and licked her 'busi' (vagina). The mother confronted the appellant but he denied the assault. The matter was reported to the police and the following day, the victim was medically examined. The examining doctor found redness on the victim's genitalia and tear on the hymen on two positions. 
 
 
[11] Apart from the appellant's previous good character, there was no other compelling mitigating factor. The trial judge gave a reduction of two years for the appellant's previous good character. The sentence of 14 years' imprisonment is within the tariff for child rape (Anand Abhay Raj v The State unreported Criminal Appeal No. CAV003 of 2014; 20 August 2014). There is no arguable error in the sentencing discretion of the trial judge.
 
 
Result
Leave to appeal against conviction and sentence is refused.

53,781,82051,"JUDGMENT

[1] The Appellant appeals against conviction and sentence for one count of indecent assault and one count of criminal trespass. He was charged on the 13th of May 2008, with unlawfully and indecently assaulting Nurslin Powell Wise, and with entering the dwelling house of Nurslin Powell Wise without lawful excuse.

[2] The case was first called on the 13th of May 2008, and after being informed of his right to counsel (which he waived) the Appellant pleaded not guilty on Count 1, and guilty on Count 2. The court noted that the Appellant appeared to have been assaulted because he had a swollen and black left eye. The Appellant was remanded in custody because of tension between him and the husband of the victim. He agreed to be remanded saying that the victim’s husband had ""taken the law into [his] own hands.""

[3] On the 9th of June 2008, the summary of facts on Count 2, was read out. The Appellant disputed it, the guilty plea was vacated and a hearing date fixed for the 6th of August 2008. The Appellant was granted bail.

[4] The trial commenced on the 6th of August. The evidence of Nurslin Liangi Mary Powell Wise was that on the 10th of May 2008 she was at home. She had dinner after 10pm, then drank yaqona with her mother-in-law until 1am. She heard her husband’s voice from the beach and she joined him there. He was drinking with his uncle and cousin. He dropped her home and she went to sleep with her daughter. After 3am the Appellant came into her room and touched her private parts. She sat up and told him to leave the room. He touched her face and told her to look at him. She pushed him away and ran out of the room. She went to the beach and told her husband what had happened. She also told her mother-in-law. Under cross-examination she said she did not shout when the Appellant touched her private parts because she was frightened that he would do something else. It was suggested to her that she and the Appellant had previously had a brief ""affair"" and said she had never gone out with him although they had all had a drink together.

[5] Her husband also gave evidence. His evidence was similar to his wife’s. He further said that his wife told him on her second trip to the beach, that his uncle Herbert had come into her room, and touched her private parts. He then went to look for the Appellant. The Appellant denied doing anything to the victim and one of his cousins hit the Appellant.

[6] In cross-examination it was suggested to him that he had accused the Appellant of blocking his wife’s mouth and trying to rape her, but he denied that he had said this to the Appellant.

[7] The caution interview of the Appellant was tendered without objection. In it the Appellant said that he had been drinking with a group of men including John Wise (the victim’s husband) at Wainivolio until 1am. He then went to the house of John Wise to call Nurslin. He entered the house and went to the bedroom. The light was on and he woke Nurslin up. He pulled her blanket and called her name three times. She woke up and walked to the kitchen and said her mother-in-law would be coming. He admitted putting his hand on her face and saying ‘look at me’ but denied touching her private parts. He said he only wanted to confirm that Nurslin would drink with him. He said that in the past, Nurslin had been flirting with him.

[8] There was a case to answer. The Appellant gave sworn evidence. He said that he did enter the victim’s house but that he only wanted to talk to her about previous incidents when she had flirted with him. He said he did not indecently assault her and that he could not have touched her face and touched her private parts at the same time. Under cross-examination he said he had entered the bedroom because she had flirted with him and had talked about having a lesbian relationship with her sister.

[9] Judgment was delivered after the Appellant made submissions. The learned Magistrate defined ""indecent assault"" as an act or acts which are immodest, obscene or countenanced standards of decent behavior. She accepted the evidence of the complainant saying that there was no reason for the complainant to run out to her husband if the Appellant had only come to the bedroom to talk. She said that the Appellant did not present himself as a truthful witness and went to some length to attack the victim’s character. She found the case against the Appellant proven beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him on both counts. She sentenced him after he refused to mitigate, to 2 months imprisonment on Count 1, and 21 months imprisonment on Count 2, to be served concurrently.

[10] The grounds of appeal are that the learned Magistrate was swayed by emotion because she was a woman, that the victim was incapable of belief because the Appellant could not have been touching her private parts and her face at the same time, that there was no medical evidence of a forced penetration or an injury, that the case was fabricated by the police because of a long-standing grudge against him, and that he was assaulted by the victim’s husband, which assault had not been investigated.

[11] The State submitted that the learned Magistrate accepted the evidence of the victim because the victim was a credible witness, that the victim was cross-examined by the Appellant and he did not raise the question of any forced penetration, that the medical report was tendered and that there was no basis of alleging a fabrication of the evidence by the police.

[12] At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant objected to a female judge hearing the matter. He said that the trial magistrate had been female and biased against him because of his gender. I explained to him that the gender of the judge or magistrate can never be, on its own, the basis of a claim of bias. If this were so, then the prosecution could object to a male judge hearing a sexual assault case on the basis that male judges are biased against women. His objection to a female judge and similarly his ground of appeal based on the gender of the learned Magistrate could not be sustained. Nor could his submission of his petition of appeal, that the victim was not worthy of belief because biblically, women are by nature deceptive and untruthful.

[13] Having perused the record and the way in which the trial was conducted I consider that the proceedings were fair, transparent and predictable. The victim’s evidence was, up to the incident in her room, corroborated by the Appellant’s own version of the facts. The only matter in dispute is the nature of the Appellant’s touching of the victim. The learned Magistrate preferred the victim’s evidence. There was nothing inconsistent with the Appellant touching the victim’s private parts and her face in the course of the same incident. On questions of fact and credibility an appellate court should not lightly interfere with the decisions of the trial court.

[14] Nor is there evidence of a police fabrication. Indeed the Appellant did not dispute his police statement which was in any event identical to his sworn evidence in court. Nor did the Appellant put to the police officer Constable Makutu, in the course of his evidence, that the police had fabricated the case against the Appellant.

[15] For these reasons the Appellant’s appeal against conviction is dismissed. He does not appeal against sentence. However the sentence for indecent assault is within the tariff for the offence, and the concurrent sentences are correct in principle because the trespass and the assault were both part of one criminal transaction. The Appellant has a number of previous convictions (although none for sexual assault) and was not entitled to the leniency usually shown to a first offender. The assault was committed on the Appellant’s nephew’s wife and in the circumstances 21 months imprisonment was correct.

[16] This appeal is dismissed.

54,782,76507,"SENTENCE

Since the victim is still ten (10) years of age, I order her name and the identity to be suppressed in any publication. Hereinafter, she will be called Ms. S.V.

	1.	Mr. Vatiliai Gonesau, you stand convicted for the following two counts, ""Attempted Rape contrary to section 208 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 and ""Rape"" contrary to section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, upon your own plea of guilt.

	2.	The Statement of Offence and the Particulars of the Offence are as follows:

First Count

Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED RAPE: Contrary to Section 298 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009
Particulars of Offence

VATILIAI GONESAU on the 4th day of May 2012 at Navunimono village, Tailevu in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of S.V. without her consent.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and 2 (b) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

VATILIAI GONESAU on the 17th day of May 2012 at Navunimono village, Tailevu in the Central Division, penetrated the anus of S.V., a child under the age of 13 years, with his finger.

	1.	According to the Agreed Summary of Facts, on 4th of May 2012, you called Ms. S.V. to you, while she was on the way to Sunday school choir practice. When she came, you had lifted her and taken her to the village hall. After placing Ms. S.V. on a table there, you had removed her panty and laid on top of her. Though you had tried to insert your penis into her vagina, you had to run away as you overheard some people talking and coming towards the hall.

	2.	Then, on 17th of May 2012, when Ms. S.V. came to your home asking for a box of matches, you had lifted her and taken to the bed, after closing the front door. You had removed her under garments along with yours and laid on top of her. After trying to insert your penis into her vagina, you had turned her around forcefully and inserted your penis into her anus. When you heard someone knocking on the door, you had stopped what you were doing.

	3.	The medical findings of the doctor who examined Ms. S.V. on 18th May, the following day, confirm that there was a fresh tear of 0.5cm at 1 o'clock position on the anal opening. The doctor's professional opinion is that the 'fresh injury at the anal opening resulted from sexual abuse.""

	4.	The maximum sentence for 'Rape' under the Crimes Decree, as well as the Penal Code, is life imprisonment. For a rape on child, the tariff ranges from 10 to 15 years imprisonment. (see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva, State v NK, Criminal Case No. HAC 155 of 2010, State v Nacanieli Yavala, Criminal Case No. HAC 129 of 2012 and State v Simione Taleusila, Criminal Case No. HAC 11 of 2010).

	5.	First, for the offence of 'Rape', I take a starting point of 12 years imprisonment.

	6.	At the time you committed the charged offences, the victim was a small girl of 10 years. You, without any respect to her childhood, took the advantage of her innocence and vulnerability and exposed her to sexual activities, not only once, but twice. The emotional and psychological suffering of the victim as a result of your acts, is undoubtedly enormous. That is evident from the Victim Impact Statement as well. Now, Ms. S.V., is said to be afraid, having sleeping disorder and finding it difficult to follow the school work. The alarming factor is that, according to this report, she is been teased by the other children in the village by calling your name. All these things will affect the psychological well-being of the victim. These aggravating features will increase your sentence by 5 years imprisonment.

	7.	In mitigation, you aver that you are still 20 years of age and was only 18, at the time of the commission of the offences. You are a first offender. Since your father passed away in 2012, you looked after your mother by farming and selling whatever you are able to produce. You had to drop your studies due to peer pressure when you reached Form 4. I reduce 2 years for all these mitigating factors.

	8.	Now your sentence stands at 15 years imprisonment. You deserve to have a reduction of a third from this interim sentence, as you pleaded guilty to the charges at the first available opportunity and not only saved the time and resources of the court, but saved the victim of been traumatized again by recalling her experiences with you. This, in turn, showed your true colours of remorse. Therefore, your final sentence for the offence of 'Rape' is 10 years imprisonment.

	9.	The maximum sentence for the offence of Attempted Rape is 10 years imprisonment. The tariff ranges from 12 months to 5 years imprisonment. [State v Bulivou [2010] FJHC 382; Bulimaiwai v State [2005] FJHC 261; HAA0068J.2005, 2nd September 2005 and State v Samuela Kiniboi Criminal Case No. HAC 162 of 2012].

	10.	The aggravating and mitigating circumstances, which have to be considered for the 1st count of Attempted Rape, are almost the same as stated in paragraphs 8 and 9. Hence, I conclude that a term of 4 years imprisonment for the offence of Attempted Rape would reflect your culpability. Your sentence for the first count of Attempted Rape is 4 years imprisonment.

	11.	Having considered the totality principle, I order both the sentences of 4 years imprisonment and 10 years imprisonment for 1st and 2nd counts respectively, to run concurrently.

	12.	I note that you are in remand custody since 19th February 2014 in relation to this case. That is three (3) months and one (1) week. In terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I order that period to be deducted from your final sentence of 10 years. Now your sentence is nine (9) years, eight (8) months and three (3) weeks.

	13.	Finally, having considered your young age, still being twenty (20), I decide not to order a non-parole period.

55,783,251854,"RULING
 
 
[1] The appellant was charged with digital rape of a juvenile girl. Following a trial in the High Court at Suva, the three assessors gave their opinions that the appellant was not guilty of the charge. The trial judge disagreed and in a written judgment convicted the appellant of rape and sentenced him to 9 years, 11 months and 14 days imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, 11 months and 14 days. This is a timely application for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence pursuant to section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. 12. The test for leave to appeal against conviction is whether the appeal is arguable (Naisua v State unreported Cr. App. No. CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). The test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether there is an arguable error in the sentencing discretion (Naisua v State unreported Cr. App. No. CAV0010 of 2013; 20 November 2013). 
 
 
[2] Briefly, the facts were that on 22 July 2013, the appellant invited the victim to his home to baby sit his child. The victim was 16 years old. Her mother dropped her off at the appellant’s house in the morning. Occasionally, the victim’s parents did paid house chores for the appellant. When the appellant returned home, he went and sat beside the victim, while the appellant’s child was in the shower. The appellant removed the victim’s pants and the underwear and penetrated her vagina with his fingers without her consent. As a result, the victim’s hymen was ruptured. She managed to push the appellant away and at that point he got up and went away. When the victim’s mother returned in the afternoon to the appellant’s house, she observed that the victim was distressed. When they returned to their home, the victim told her mother that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant. The matter was reported to police.
 
 
[3] Counsel for the appellant advances the following grounds of appeal:
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact by failing to consider the medical evidence which stated that the injury appeared to have occurred within 24 to 28 hours and the doctor further defining in his evidence under oath that he should have stated that the injury has occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination, thereby implying that the injury was possibly 2 days old.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self-inflicted, therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the Appellant who had caused the injuries to the Complainant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self-inflicted, therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the Appellant who had caused the injuries to the Complainant. 
 
 
• THAT the Learned trial Judge erred in law and fact in not considering that had the Appellant intended to commit the offence, he could have chosen the more probable venues, which were the 3 bedrooms in the house rather than choosing the sitting room to be fully exposed to the Appellant’s 10 year old daughter and an uninterrupted access to the daughter at anytime.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself and contracted himself in accordance with the directions given in his summing up at (paragraph 8) when assessing the testimony of a witness.

THAT the Learned Trial Judged erred in law and fact in holding that the evidence given by the 2nd Defence Witness, Nisha Neha Bilash was not credible and that the demeanor at the time she gave evidence was not acceptable and failing to c consider the age of the witness at the time of giving evidence, in that she was clearly facing the Trial Judge, all the counsels, the assessors and the Appellant throughout the entire time that she gave evidence, hence eye contact with the Appellant could not be avoided at the material time, and further that she gave clear answers to the questions asked and also, that similar type of demeanor was portrayed by the Doctor when she gave evidence in that there were long pauses before he answered the questions and he took longer time to give h is answers despite being a professional and deemed to have sufficient knowledge of the injuries in question and who looked down most of the time at the time of answering questions.
 
  
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding that the evidence of the Complainant was credible when he failed to consider that there were several inconsistencies in her evidence in court, compared to the information that she gave to police and the she gave to the medical doctor. Failure to direct himself on previous inconsistent statement in law of the complainant cause substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in accepting the evidence of the Complainant when she said in re-examination that the reason she did not tell the police about the Appellant kissing her breast was because she was scared and ashamed when it ought to hold that such an explanation was least probable in light of fact that she was without any hesitation able to tell the police about the alleged penetration in her vagina by the Appellant, and therefore the Complainant’s version of the whole situation ought not be believed.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding the Complainant as a credible witness and not taking into account that on one hand the Complainant gave evidence that the Appellant had forced her pants down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down, whilst on the other hand she admitted that her clothes buttons were not broken, her clothes were still in good condition when her mother came to take her at 5.00 pm, she did not have any bruises or marks over her hands or waist area, and she did not shout even to raise alarm for Neha Nishika Bilash to hear who was right inside the house or to the neighbours, whose house were just 2 to 3 meters away.
 
 
• THAT the Learned trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding that the offence was committed by the Appellant when the Appellant’s daughter was having her bath, without any cogent proof evidence and not accepting the daughter’s evidence when she said that she never went for a bath whilst the Complainant was at their home between 4.00 pm to 5.00 pm.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not accepting the evidence given by the Appellant without any cogent reasoning.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in holding that Neha Nishika Bilash’s evidence was inconsistent and unreliable when Neha stated that she did not see her father put the bag on the dining table and taking out food, and also when she said her father was still eating when the Complainant’s mother came whereas the Appellant’s version was that he had already eaten before the Complainant’s mother came, and failing to consider that whatever happened in the kitchen was irrelevant and that the main issue was as to whether the incident as alleged by Complainant occurred in the sitting room during that time. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected and contradicted himself in his summing up paragraphs 9, 10 and 11.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in overturning the unanimous decisions of the Assessors of Not Guilty and failing to consider that the facts of the case and the evidence given by each of the witness clearly indicated that the Complaint by the Complainant was highly likely to be falsely made.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in misdirecting himself when he stated that “I observed the demeanor of the complainant when she gave evidence. I did not note any attempt by her to exaggerate. In my view, she gave honest answers” relying only on the demeanor of the Complainant and not whole evidence as a whole caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge did not direct himself and take into consideration the evidence of the Medical Practitioner that there could be possibility that the complainant did not suffer any injuries as during the complainant’s examination no injuries were found and as such there is possibility that no injury was caused to her.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge did not consider/ analyze the Defence case adequately/or in detail in particular the evidence of the Accused’s daughter who was present in the room with the victim but did not see the Appellant committing the offence as charged. In the circumstances there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding the Appellant guilty that when the Appellant was called at the Police Station he was not interviewed on the same day. The Police Officers told the Appellant that he would be interviewed later and despite the fact the Appellant requested that it was getting late night and he requested the Police Officers to take the Complainant for medical examination same night because he was concerned that the Complainant will go and do something to herself and thereafter blame the appellant by not doing so there was a substantial miscarriage of justice as it created serious doubts of self inflicted injuries by the Complainant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in overruling the unanimous verdict of the Assessors of Not Guilty did not give cogent reasons as to why he overruled the unanimous not guilty opinion of the three assessors in light of the whole of the evidence presented in the trial.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself that the Prosecution evidence before the Court proved beyond reasonable doubts that there were serious doubts in the Prosecution case and as such the benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the Appellant.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in commenting on the evidence raising a new theory on the facts, uncanvassed during the course of the trial whereby the defence has had no opportunity of commenting upon it.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to refer any Summing Up the possible defence on evidence and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately/sufficiently/referring/directing/putting/considering the Appellant’s case to the Prosecutions and Defence evidence.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge while correctly directing the assessors in paragraph 5 of his Summing Up that “You must not speculate about what evidence there might have been” misdirected himself and erred in law and in fact in speculating when he stated in his Judgment Paragraph 26 that “The defence counsel attempted to paint the picture that the complainant was poor, she wears short and tight fittings and she made this complaint in order to claim money from the accused. The unanimous in order opinion of the assessors that the accused is not guilty shows the defence counsel has in fact been successful in painting that picture in the minds of the assessors. In my view that picture had prejudiced the assessors mind against the complainant and the assessors failed to comprehend that those facts are not relevant in deciding whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offence charged.”
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact by finding the Appellant guilty of the offence charged contradicted himself in his summing up at paragraph 67 when he gave inter alia 3 options:-
  
• (i) You may believe his expectations and, if you believe him, then your opinion must be that the accused is ‘not guilty’.
 
 
• (ii) Without necessarily believing him you may think, ‘well what he says might be true’. If that is so, it means that there is reasonable doubt in your mind and therefore, again your opinion must be ‘not guilty’.
 
 
• (iii) The third possibility is that you reject his evidence, But if you disbelieve him, that itself does not make him guilty of an offence charged. The situation would then be the same as if he had not given any evidence at all. You should still consider whether prosecution has proved all the elements beyond reasonable doubt. If you are sure that the prosecution has proved all the elements, then your proper opinion would be that the accused is ‘guilty’ of the offence.
 


That despite the above directions the 3 assessors found the appellant not guilty and the Learned Trial Judge by overturning their unanimous opinion of not guilty and without giving cogent reasons had caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• THAT the Appellant reserves the right to appeal such further and other Grounds as the Appellant may be advised upon the receipt of the Court Record.
 

APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• THAT the Appellant relies on Grounds 1 to 23 stated herein above.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in ordering a sentence of 9 years 11 months and 14 days with parole of 7 years 11 months and 14 days, which is manifestly excessive and failed to consider that the facts of the case were not so grave as to amount to a harsh and severe penalty.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in considering that the Police Officer had cooperated with the Appellant in allowing him more time during the investigation process when it ought to have considered that it was the Appellant who had cooperated with police for some 10 months, that was since the date of the complaint, until the time the Appellant was charged by Police, and therefore this factor ought to be considered as a ground for mitigation whilst passing the sentence.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the Appellant and not taking into relevant consideration.
 
 
• THAT the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 when he passed the sentence against the Appellant.
 

[4] At the hearing, both parties relied upon their respective written submissions. Unfortunately, a substantial part of the appellant’s submissions deal with the test for leave to appeal. Without making submissions on each ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submits that the grounds are arguable and have strong prospects of success for leave and bail to be granted. 
 
 
[5] The victim was medically examined a day after the alleged incident. The examining doctor found that the victim’s hymen was ruptured. The doctor’s opinion was that the injury had occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination. The doctor said that the injury could have been caused by a penis, finger or a foreign object penetrating the vagina vigorously. The doctor also said that there was a possibility that the injury could be self-inflicted but it would be very painful. The learned trial judge fairly summarized the medical evidence in his summing-up. At the end of the day, the medical evidence did not implicate the appellant. The learned trial judge convicted the appellant because he believed the victim was telling the truth when she said the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his fingers. Grounds one, two, three and fourteen are unarguable.
 
 
[6] Grounds four and sixteen are speculative and unarguable. 
 
 
[7] There is no contradiction in the manner in which the learned trial judge dealt with the testimony of the appellant’s daughter. In paragraphs 12, 13 and 23 of the judgment, the learned trial judge gave reasons why he chose not to give much weight to the evidence of the appellant’s daughter. Grounds five, nine, eleven and fifteen are unarguable. 
 
 
[8] The inconsistencies in the evidence of the victim were dealt in the summing-up and in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the judgment. The learned trial judge did not find the inconsistencies material. He found the victim to be a credible witness despite the inconsistencies. Grounds six, seven and eight are unarguable. 
 
 
[9] The learned trial judge dealt with the appellant’s evidence in paragraphs 11 and 20 of the judgment. The learned trial judge gave cogent reasons for not believing the appellant’s evidence. Ground ten is unarguable. 
 
 
[10] The learned trial judge gave detailed reasons for not accepting the opinions of the assessors. The reasons given for convicting the appellant are cogent. I think both the summing-up and the judgment are impeccable. Grounds twelve and seventeen to twenty-three are unarguable. 
 
 
[11] The learned trial judge did not misdirect when he found the victim to be an honest witness based on her demeanour when she gave evidence. Ground thirteen is unarguable. 
 
 
[12] The sentence of 9 years, 11 months and 14 days for rape of a juvenile girl in a contested case is on the lower end of the tariff for rape (Raj v State unreported CAV003.2014; 20 August 2014). The learned trial judge’s assessment of the aggravating and mitigating factors was correct. I am not convinced that there is an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
 
 
-
 
[13] For these reasons, I refuse leave to appeal against conviction and sentence. 
 
 
[14] The test for bail pending appeal is more stringent. When considering granting of bail to a convicted person, the court must bear in mind that the presumption in favour of grant of bail is displaced. The Bail Act 2002 specifically requires the court to consider the following factors when considering bail pending an appeal:
 
 
 (a) The likelihood of success in the appeal;
 
 (b) The likely time before the appeal hearing;
 
 (c) The proportion of the original sentence which will have been served by the appellant when the appeal is heard.
 

[15] The threshold for the likelihood of success is very high. Bail is granted only if the appeal has a very high likelihood of success (Zhong v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU44 of 2013; 15 July 2014, Tiritiri v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU9 of 2011; 17 July 2015). 
 
 
[16] It therefore follows that the two remaining factors set out in section 17(3) are less significant when the threshold of a very high likelihood of success has not been met (Seniloli & Others v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU0041/04S; 23 August 2004). So far the appellant has served ten months of his sentence. 
 
 
[17] When considering the factors under section 17(3), the court may also consider exceptional circumstances, that is, “circumstances which drive the court to the conclusion that justice can only be done by granting bail” (Mudaliar v The State unreported Cr App. No. AAU0032 of 2006; 16 June 2006, at [5] per Ward P). None of the matters advanced by the appellant constitutes exceptional circumstance especially when the appellant has failed to satisfy the threshold of a very high likelihood of success in appeal (Silatolu v The State unreported Cr App No. AAU0024 of 2003; 27 September 2004). For these reasons, the application for bail fails. 
 
 
[18] Result
 
 
Leave to appeal against conviction and sentence is refused.
 
The application for bail pending appeal is refused.

56,784,81384,"SENTENCE

	1.	On 15th February, 2013, the accused, in the presence of his counsel, pleaded guilty to the following charges:

COUNT ONE

Statement of Offence

ATTEMPTED RAPE: Contrary to Section 208 of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
TANIELA RATUNAQELE on the 28th day of January, 2012 at Delaitokatoka, Suva, in the Central Division, attempted to have carnal knowledge of L. L. R without her consent.

COUNT TWO

Statement of Offence
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
TANIELA RATUNAQELE on the 28th day of January, 2012 at Delaitokatoka, Suva, in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted L. L. R by licking her vagina.

	1.	On 15th March, 2013, the prosecution read the Summary of Facts in court. It was as follows. The accused, on 28th January, 2012, was 41 years, not married but with two children aged 18 years and 10 years. He ran a small canteen at Delaitokatoka, Suva. He reached class 3 level education. The complainant was a 6 years old child, living in the neighbourhood with her family. On 28th January, 2012, after 5 pm, her mother sent her to the accused's canteen to buy some mango skin. When she reached the canteen, the accused was returning from his shopping. They went inside the canteen. The complainant told the accused she wanted to buy some mango skin. The accused took the money from her, and suddenly pulled her to his room.

3. He then forcefully took off her clothes. The accused then licked the child's vagina. He then lay on top of her and rubbed his penis on her vagina. In his police caution interview statement, he admitted he wanted to penetrate the complainant's vagina. [Questions and Answers 26, 27 and 28]. He later ejaculated. The complainant ran out of his room and informed her mother. The matter was reported to police. She was medically examined the same day at CWM Hospital. The accused was later charged for the current offences.

4. The court checked with defence counsel to see that all the elements of the offences were admitted by the accused. Defence counsel said, the accused admitted he attempted to rape the child complainant, at the material time. They were aware that she was incapable of giving her consent, as a matter of law. Defence counsel also admitted, on behalf of the accused that, he sexually assaulted the child complainant, by licking her vagina. As a result of the above admissions, the court found the accused guilty as charged on count no.1 and 2, and convicted him accordingly.

5. Section 208 of the Crimes Decree 2009 prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for ""attempted rape"". Yet, Section 44(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 reads as follows:

""...A person who attempts to commit the offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed...""

	1.	The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment [Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009]. The tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Mark Lawrence Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1990, Fiji Court of Appeal; The State v N. K, Criminal Case No. HAC 155 of 2010, High Court, Suva; State v Simione Talenasila, Criminal Case No. HAC 11 of 2010, High Court, Lautoka. In my view, to reconcile the above authorities, the dictates of Section 44(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 must be followed. It is arguable that, previous case authorities limiting the tariff for attempted rape to 1 to 5 years imprisonment, may be overtaken by the effect of Section 44(1) abovementioned.

	2.	Section 210 (1)(a) and (2) of the Crimes Decree 2009 prescribes a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for sexual assault that involved the licking of the complainant's vagina. I accept what His Lordship Mr. Justice Paul Madigan said in State v Abdul Khaiyum, Criminal Case No. HAC 160 of 2010, that the tariff should be a sentence between 2 to 8 years imprisonment, with the higher sentence reserved for the more serious sexual assaults, and the low sentence on the less serious assaults.

	3.	The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows:
		(i) This was an abuse of a 6 years old child. Children are always vulnerable, and the courts have repeatedly said, they will act to protect children in society, by passing severe sentence.

		(ii) This was also a breach of trust case. Canteen owners in a neighborhood always stand in a position of trust to children who are sent to buy items from their shop. The accused's offending violates that trust.

		(iii) The accused's offendings amounted to violating the rights of this child to live peacefully and happily in the neighbourhood.

	4.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) You pleaded guilty to the offence, although this was 12 months after the first call in court. You nevertheless saved the court's time, and the need for the complainant to re-live her ordeal in the courtroom, by giving evidence;

		(ii) At the age of 41 years, this is your first offence;

		(iii) You have been remanded in custody since your first appearance in the Nasinu Magistrate Court on 30th January, 2012, that is, 1 year 3 months ago.

	5.	On the ""attempted rape"" charge [count no. 1], I start with a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the same by 5 years to 5 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the same by 5 years to 10 years imprisonment. For attempting to rape the 6 years old female complainant, I sentence you, Taniela Ratunaqele to 10 years imprisonment.

	6.	On the ""sexual assault"" charge [count no. 2], I start with a sentence of 5 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 8 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I decrease the same by 3 years, leaving a balance of 5 years imprisonment. For sexual assaulting the 6 years old female complainant, I sentence you, Taniela Ratunaqele, to 5 years imprisonment.

	7.	I make the 5 years imprisonment on count no. 2 partly concurrent and partly consecutive to the sentence in count no. 1. Three years of the 5 years sentence is consecutive to the sentence in count no. 1, and 2 years is concurrent to the sentence in count no. 1.

	8.	In summary, your total sentence on both counts is 13 years imprisonment, effective forthwith. You are to serve a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment.

	9.	The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

57,785,81171,"SENTENCE

[1] The Accused stands convicted of one count of rape. Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children. Children are our future. The courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.

[2] In this case, the circumstances of the offending are serious. The victim was 4 years old when she was raped. The Accused was 34 years old and was in a position of trust. He was the victim’s neighbour and the victim called him grandfather. The victim was lured into the Accused’s house when she was playing outside and raped. Medical examination revealed abrasions and tenderness around the victim’s vagina. Her hymen was not intact.

[3] In mitigation, the Accused said he is 34 years old and is unemployed. He is in a de facto relationship. He has attained up to primary education. The Accused has 5 brothers and 2 sisters. His partner is depended on him. The Accused has no criminal history. He has been in remand since 27 August 2008 awaiting sentence. Although the Accused has exercised his right to a trial, I see from the court record that he only asked the complainant one question in cross examination.

[5] The prosecution has tendered a victim impact statement. The author of the report is the complainant’s grandmother. The Accused objects to the report on the ground that the report contains expert opinion evidence and that the author is not qualified to express such opinion. I agree and disregard the report from my consideration of the sentence.

[6] The only mitigating factor is the Accused’s previous good character. I give no weight to the fact that he is the sole bread winner in his family because when he committed the offence he was unemployed. 

[7] The aggravating features in this case are the tender age of the victim, the age gap between the victim and the Accused, and the breach of trust by the Accused.

[8] The tariff for rape of a child is between 10 to 14 years imprisonment (Mutch v State, Cr. App. AAU0060/99, Mani v State, Cr. App. No. HAA0053/02L, State v Saitava, Cr. Case No. HAC10/07, State v Marawa, Cr. Case No. 016/03, Drotini v State, Cr. App. AAU001/05 and State v Tony, Cr. App. No. HAA003/08).

[9] Since this is a case of a single count of rape, I use 10 years as my starting point. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors and reduce 2 years for the mitigating factor and the time spent in remand.

[10] The Accused is sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. The Accused is advised he has a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal within 30 days.

PARTICULARS OF OFFENCE

PRIYA DARSHANI on the 18th of December 2013 at Lautoka in the Western Division attempted to murder ANNA KAIFONUA MILIANA PATOLO.

	1.	On 3rd April 2014 you pleaded guilty to all five charges against you and admitted the Summary of Facts on 4th April 2014.

	2.	The Summary of Facts submitted by the State Counsel states as follows:

The accused in this case is Priya Darshani. She is 22 years of age and unemployed. The accused lived in a de-facto relationship with Mokai Falakiko Patolo, a machine operator at Royal Noni Fiji (Kura Factory).

Mokai Falakiko Patolo was in a de-facto relationship with Taufa Patolo, 33 years of age and unemployed. Together they have 4 children. Priya Darshani has a child also with Mokai Falakiko Patolo. The accused and Mokai Falakiko Patoto live in a separate house in Lawaki in Lautoka.

On the 18th of December 2013 at about 10am, the accused went to Veiseisei, Lautoka to the house where Taufa Patolo and her children were living.

Upon seeing the accused, Taufa Patolo (deceased) had an argument with the accused on why she had come to their house.

From the argument, the accused picked up a crow bar which was lying outside the house and struck Taufa Patolo (deceased) on her head. Taufa Patolo (deceased) was carrying her 7 month old baby, Sarah Rosemary Patolo, at the time that she was struck and they both fell to the floor.

While Taufa Patolo was lying on the floor, the accused hit her head several times and thereafter struck the 7 month baby on her head. The accused when went after Taufa Patolo's 3 children who were also in the house and struck them with the crow bar which led to serious injuries as noted in their medical report (attached).

Both Taufa Patolo and the 7 month old baby instantly died and the 3 children lay in the house injured. The accused then left the house of Taufa Patolo.

Neighbours of Taufa Patolo had heard the commotion but when they checked the house of Taufa Patolo, they found Taufa Patolo and her children lying in a pool of blood. The accused was also seen by the neighbours walking away from the house of Taufa Patolo. The accused was seen rushing away carrying her son.

Calls were made to the husband of Taufa Patolo and he came and rushed his wife and children to the Lautoka Hospital.

On 20th of December 2013, a Post Mortem was conducted by Doctor Avikali and Doctor Praneel on both the deceased.

The Post Mortem reports revealed the following injuries:

Taufa Patolo

According to the Post Mortem Report of Taufa Patolo the condition directly leading to death was extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. The antecedent causes were multiple traumatic head injuries due to blunt force trauma.

Sarah Rosemary Patolo

According to the Post Mortem Report of Sarah Rosemary Patolo the condition directly leading to death was massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. The antecedent causes were head injury due to blunt force trauma.

There were also medical reports that were done on Grace Patolo, Angeline Fisi Patolo and Anna Kaifonua Miliana. The reports had noted the following:

Anna Kaifonua Miliana Patolo
Injuries

According to the medical report in which the examination was conducted on the 18th of February 2014, it noted the following:

a) Head injury suspected skull fracture
b) Soft tissue injury – abrasion, bruising nasal bridge (nose)
c) Laceration over left ear (1cm)
d) Left Chin laceration (2cm)
e) Bruising on left of chest

The opinion of the doctor was that the child was assaulted with a blunt weapon resulting into bruising and with a sharp weapon resulting injuries such as laceration. Non accidental injuries.

Grace Patolo
Injuries

Her medical examination had noted the following injuries:

a) Mild head injury
b) Multiple lacerations on face
c) Abrasion on neck (7cm)
d) Laceration L Ear pin (2cm)

a) Complete transected trachea (wind pipe)
b) Stab wound neck
c) Neck laceration
d) Severe head injury 
e) Deep laceration mandible region
f) Bruising R eye, Abrasion face
g) Depressed skull fracture

The doctor further noted that there was bleeding from the mouth and nose and bruising on her chest wall.

The accused was arrested and interviewed by the Police. She had admitted that she was the person that had murdered Taufa Patolo and Sarah Rosemary Patolo and also injured the 3 children namely Grace Patolo, Angelina Fisi Patolo and Anna Kaifonua Miliana. The accused had admitted that the reason she went to Veiseisei was to go and kill Taufa and the family and she did not like them.

Accordingly, the State has filed charges for Murder and Attempted Murder. The accused person had on the 3rd of April 2014 pleaded guilty to all counts. 

	1.	After carefully considering the Plea of you to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for two counts of Murder contrary to Section 237 (1) of the Crimes Decree and three counts of Attempted Murder contrary to Section 44 (1) and Section 237 (1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

	2.	Accused Priya Darshani you stand convicted for two counts of Murder and three counts of attempted Murder.

	3.	The mandatory sentence fixed by law for Murder and Attempted Murder is that the convicted person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. There is no discretion allowed to the Court in a murder case to sentence to a lesser term.

	4.	It is well known that convicted persons sentenced to life imprisonment usually do not serve the full term, that is serve imprisonment for the rest of their lives
	5.	In State v Momo [2012] FJHC 1093; HAC 086.2011 (18 May 2012) Hon. Mr. Justice Temo had discussed this issue in detail. 

""Murder"" is a serious offence, and it is often said, to be at the top of the criminal calendar. It carries a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment. (Section 237, Crime Decree 2009). The court has the power to fix a non-parole period to be served, before a prisoner is eligible for parole. Case precedents show that the non- parole period for murder varies widely, depending on the peculiar facts of the case. In Waisale Waqanivalu v The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2007, Supreme Court, Fiji, on 5 counts of murder and 1 of attempted murder, the accused was given 19 years non-parole period on each murder count, and 10 years consecutive on a pending prison sentence, total non-parole period was 26 years. In State v Niume & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 010 of 2010, High Court, Suva, on 2 counts of murder, Accused No. 1 was given 25 years non-parole period for the murder counts. In State v Ashwin Chand, Criminal Case No. HAC 032 of 2005, High Court, Lautoka, on a count of murder, the accused was given a non-parole period of 22 years. In State v Navau Lebobo, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2002, High Court, Suva, the non-parole period was 20 years. Twenty years non-parole period were also imposed in the following three cases: State v Anesh Ram, Criminal Case No. HAC 124 of 2008S, High Court, Suva; The State v Bharat Lal & Others, Criminal Case No. HAC 061 of 2009S, High Court, Suva; The State v Balekivuya, Criminal Case No. 095 of 2010S, High Court, Suva. In State v Tukana, Criminal Case No. HAC 021 of 2009, High Court, Lautoka, the non-parole period was 11 years. The non-parole period imposed will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

	1.	Aggravating factors;
		(i) Use of a weapon-crow bar to inflict injuries on the two deceased and the three child victims

		(ii) One deceased was 7 months old baby while three child victims were of a young and tender age

		(iii) The offence was violent of nature and caused severe injuries on the three child victims

		(iv) The actions of the accused person has deprived the three child victims from the love and affection of a mother

		(v) Psychological trauma on the three child victims.

	2.	Mitigating circumstances:
		(i) You are first offender at the age of 22 years 

		(ii) You are mother of 1 year and two months old son 

		(iii) You pleaded guilty on first available occasion

		(iv) You are remorseful

		(v) You were in remand from 18.12.2013.

	3.	After weighing the aggravating factors against the mitigating circumstances of this case, I fix a one head non-parole period of 20 years acting under Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

	4.	Your sentences are as follows: 
		(i) 1st count of Murder - Life imprisonment

		(ii) 2nd count of Murder – Life imprisonment

		(iii) 3rd count of Attempted Murder - Life imprisonment

		(iv) 4th count of Attempted Murder - Life Imprisonment

		(v) 5th count of Attempted Murder - Life imprisonment

You are not eligible for parole till serving 20 years imprisonment from 18.12.2013.

	1.	30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal with leave from that Court.

• This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the Appellant.
 
 
• The Appellant was charged with one count of rape contrary to section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree, 2009.
 
 
• The Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years with effect from 16th May 2013.
 
 
• The Appellant was the uncle of the complainant who was 7 years old and was living in the same house. The complainant had been watching television and lying on the lap of the Appellant. After some time he had taken the complainant to the village hall, and thereafter raped her. The child had related the incident to her mother and thereafter a complaint had been made to the Police. 
 
 
• The Appellant filed an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him and urged the following ground of appeal:
 

""That the learned sentencing Judge erred in fact and law when he failed to discount the term of more than (3) years which was the period the Petitioner spent in remand from the final sentence of the Appellant.""
 
  
• An appeal against sentence would lie in terms of Section 21(c) of the Court of Appeal Act (Cap.12) and as held by the Supreme Court in Naisua v. State [2013] FJSC 14; CAV0010.2013 (20 November 2013) if it is demonstrated the trial Judge made one of the following errors:
  
• (i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
• (ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
• (iii) Mistook the facts;
 
• (iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration.
 

 
• The Appellant had been in remand for 2 years and 7 months which period had not been discounted when the Appellant was sentenced. The Respondent has in the written submissions filed in Court conceded this position.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009 requires a sentencing Court to deduct time spent in remand when a sentence is imposed on an accused who has been found guilty of the charge against him. 
 
 
• It is established law that the period of remand should be deducted when imposing a sentence on an accused who has been found guilty. Naivalurua Koroitavalena v. The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU 0051 of 2010 (5 December 2014).
 
 
• The failure to deduct the period spent in remand by the Appellant when he was sentenced was an error and therefore leave to appeal is granted to the Appellant.

Introduction

[1] The appellant was tried and convicted in the Magistrates Court on 4 counts of rape and one of insulting or annoying a female pursuant to s.154 (4) of the Penal Code.

[2] The victim was the appellant’s daughter who was aged 11 at the time of the first offending and 15 or 16 at the time of the fourth rape. The offending took place between 23 June 1998 and 1 August 2002.

[3] The Magistrate imposed the following sentences:
Count 1 - Rape 3 ½ years
Count 2 - Rape 3 ½ years
Count 3 - Section 154(4) offence which was incorrectly
described in the charge
as “Indecent Assault” 1 year 
Count 4 - Rape 3½ years 
Count 5 - Rape 3½ years

[4] The sentences were imposed consecutively, a total custodial term of 15 years.

Appeal to the High Court

[5] The appellant appealed to the High Court against both conviction and sentence. The High Court Judge dismissed the appeal against conviction, and although the appeal against sentence was also dismissed the sentences themselves were restructured as follows:
Count 1 - Rape 15 years
Count 2 - Rape 15 years
Count 3 - Indecent Assault 3 years
Count 4 - Rape 15 years
Count 5 - Rape 15 years

[6] The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently.

[7] The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. His appeal came first before Ward, P. sitting as a single Judge. On 31 March 2005 the President held that there was no right of appeal against conviction and dismissed that appeal under s.35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act. Leave was granted, however, to appeal against sentence.

Appeal against sentence

[8] At the commencement of the appeal against sentence we invited the appellant to remain seated while the Court debated certain aspects of the sentencing judgment with State Counsel.

[9] We first raised with Counsel that, in the High Court, the Judge had relied upon s.7 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 2003 which came into force on 13 October 2003. The amendment increased the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court by lifting the maximum penalty that Court could impose for one offence from 5 to 10 years imprisonment. We pointed out to Counsel that the offending had occurred between June 1998 and August 2002 whereas the Amendment took effect over a year later in October 2003. To our surprise, Counsel first argued the change was retrospective. When, however, Article 28(1)(j) of the Constitution which provides inter alia:
“28 - (1) Every Person Charged with an offence has the right:

(j)... not to be sentenced to a more severe punishment than was applicable when the offence was committed;”

was drawn to his attention he acknowledged that his argument on a retrospective application of the amendment could not succeed. However, upon further consideration we are not persuaded that covers the point. The change in sentences which a Resident Magistrate may pass pursuant to s.7 of the Criminal Code Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003 applied from the date the Act came into force. But it does not change the maximum punishment applicable for rape (life imprisonment – s.150 Penal Code, Cap. 17) and therefore does not offend s.28(1)(j) of the Constitution.

[10] Next we examined with Counsel the Judge’s conclusion that the 2003 Amendment which lifted the Magistrates Court jurisdiction to 10 years imprisonment in the cases in which such sentences are authorized by law, also “logically” increased the longest period of imprisonment a Magistrate could impose from 14 years (s.12(2)(a)) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 21)) to 20 years (s.12(2)(b)).

[11] What the Judge said on this topic is to be found at pp 7 and 8 of the judgment under the heading “Sentence”
“Sentence

The amendment to section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment No. 13 of 2003) increased the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court on one count to ten years from five. Section 12 of the Code provides:

“12-(1) When a person is convicted at one trial of two or more distinct offences the court may sentence him for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefore which such court is competent to impose; such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration of the other in such order as the court may direct, unless the court directs that such punishments shall run concurrently.

(2) In the case of consecutive sentences it shall not be necessary for the court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to impose on conviction of a single offence, to send the offender for trial before a higher court;

Provided as follows:-

(a) in no case shall such person be sentenced to imprisonment for a longer period than fourteen years; and

(b) if the case is tried by a magistrates’ court the aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which the court is, in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, competent to impose.

(3) For the purposes of appeal or confirmation the aggregate of consecutive sentences imposed under this section in case of convictions for several offences at one trial shall be deemed to be a single sentence.”

State counsel submits that section 12(2)(a) must be read subject to section 12(2)(b), and that because the sentence which can be passed on one count in section 7 is ten years imprisonment the maximum on two counts is now 20 years imprisonment.

I agree the amount of punishment that the Magistrates Court is, in its ordinary jurisdiction competent to impose, is ten years imprisonment. Twice that maximum is 20 years imprisonment. Thus where the offender is tried in the Magistrates Court the maximum sentence which can be imposed is 20 years imprisonment. When the Code was amended to increase jurisdiction, section 12 remained without amendment. In the past, section 12(2)(b) provided authority for the passing of sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment on more than one count. Logically it must now be read to permit the passing of up to 20 years imprisonment.”

[12] Having reached that conclusion the Judge considered there was jurisdiction to increase the sentence in respect of each rape to 15 years as recorded above.

[13] Despite the possible ambiguity between subsections 12(2)(b) and 12(2)(a) created as a result of the amendment, in our judgment, there is no justification for reading down s.12(2)(a) to substitute 20 years for 14 years when the legislature has not made that change. Furthermore in a statute affecting the liberty at the subject any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the accused. On a correct application of the law no more than 10 years imprisonment could be imposed on each of the 4 rapes by the Magistrate. If consecutive sentences were imposed they could not in any event exceed 14 years – see s.12(2)(a).

[14] State Counsel also, however, (again to our surprise), sought to argue that by a combination of ss 6 and 319(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code the High Court Judge had jurisdiction to impose sentences beyond the maximum available to the Magistrates Court at the time of sentencing. Counsel took the two provisions relied upon in isolation rather than construing them in the context of the Statute as a whole and as a result has fallen into error. Section 6 relates only to sentences which the High Court can pass. Section 7 relates only to those that are a Resident Magistrate can pass. Section 8 to those a Second Class Magistrate can impose and section 9 to those a Third Class Magistrate can impose etc. Those provisions 6 and 7 are governed by section 319 which deals with the powers of the High Court. State Counsel relied upon subsection (2) of section 319 whereas subsection (1) is crucially significant. The relevant portions of the entire section read as follows:
“319. – (1) At the hearing of an appeal the High Court ... may thereupon confirm reversed or vary their decision of the magistrates court... and may by such order exercise any power which the magistrates court might have exercised: (emphasis added).

Provided that:-

(a) ...
(b) ...

(2) At the hearing of an appeal whether against conviction or against sentence, the High Court may, if it thinks that a different sentence should have been passed, quash the sentence passed by the Magistrates Court and pass such other sentence warranted in law, whether more or less severe, in substitution therefore as it thinks ought to have been passed.”

[15] It can be seen therefore that, on appeal from the Magistrate’s Court, the High Court’s jurisdiction is limited to making orders, (in this case variations of sentences), which do not go beyond exercising “any power which the magistrates court might have exercised.” The submission of the State to the contrary in an attempt to support the increases from 3 ½ years to 15 years is without merit.

[16] We turn now to the one year term of imprisonment imposed in the Magistrates Court in respect of the charge pursuant to s.154(4) of the Penal Code which was referred to in the charge sheet as a one of Indecent Assault. That description was highly misleading. Section 154(4) does not relate to assaults at all. Rather it aims to punish intentional actions short of assault which insult the modesty of women or girls, intrude on their privacy or otherwise cause annoyance. The maximum penalty is one year imprisonment. It seems that in the High Court the Judge failed to notice the incorrect wording in the charge and proceeded to increase the sentence to three years imprisonment in the mistaken belief that the Court was dealing with an indecent assault pursuant to s.154(1) of the Penal Code where the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. 

[17] That increase on the s.154(4) charge, of course, cannot stand. In our view a sentence of six months imprisonment would have been appropriate.

[18] The final extravagant submission of State Counsel, in an appearance which we can only describe as disappointing, invited us to lift the term of imprisonment from 3 ½ years to 15 years even further. That would be to heap injustice upon injustice in this case and we dismiss the suggestion out of hand.

[19] Before recording our decision we note that in Christina Doreen Skipper v. Reginam (Criminal Appeal 70/1978) this Court explained that before enhancing sentence, the Court should first warn the appellant that it has power to do so and give the appellant an opportunity to make representations. If ever there was a case that required such a warning this was it. The record does not disclose whether one was given. 

[20] After exploring the above errors of law with Counsel we enquired of the appellant if he had any further issue of law he wished to advance. He had none.

Decision
[21] 1. The increased sentences imposed in the High Court are quashed having been imposed without jurisdiction and in error of law.

2. The total penalty in the Magistrates Court of 15 years is varied and reduced to one of a total of 10 years.

3. The sentence of 10 years is arrived at by imposing a penalty on each of the 4 rape convictions of 10 years and a sentence of 6 months on the s.154(4) charge, all to be served concurrently.

61,789,267324,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. Yesterday, in the presence of your counsels, you pleaded guilty to the following counts in the following information:
 
 
FIRST COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA, on 01 November 2017, at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted A.B. by licking her vagina.
 
 
 SECOND COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA , on 01 November 2017, at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, with his finger, penetrated the vagina of A.B., a child under the age of 13 years.
 
 
2. In fact, your guilty plea came just before the trial was to start. Your trial had been set from 20 to 23 November 2018. The information was read and explained to you in the “i-taukei” and English languages. You said you understood the same. You then pleaded guilty to both counts. Your counsels were present. You told the court that no-one forced or pressured you to plead guilty. You said you pleaded guilty to the counts voluntarily and out of your own free will.
 
 
3. The prosecution presented their summary of facts in court. The same were as follows:
 A. The Accused in this matter, MATAITOGA ROGOIVOSA. He is charged with two counts – Sexual Assault and digital rape. The victim is A.B., hereinafter referred to as “the child”. The child was born on the 24th of September 2011 and therefore under the age of 13 years.
 B. The Accused is the brother of the child’s mother’s father and therefore a constant visitor to child’s home as they were very closely related.
 C. The Accused lived in the same village as the child.
 D. On the 1st day of November 2017, the child, A.B., who was 6 years old at that time, returned home from Kindergarten school. On that same day, when the child reached her home in Yacata, the Accused also arrived at her home. No one except the child was at home when the Accused went to the child’s home that afternoon – 1st November 2017.
 E. The Accused then told the child to remove her pants and her undergarments. The child followed what the Accused told her and removed her pants and her undergarments.
 F. After the child removed her pants and her undergarments, the Accused proceeded to do the following to her:
 G. SEXUAL ASSAULT
 The Accused, Mataitoga Rogoivosa, then used his tongue to lick the vagina of the child, A.B., who was at that time, under the age of 13 years.
 RAPE
 Thereafter, the Accused, Mataitoga Rogoivosa, penetrated his finger into the vagina of the child, A.B., who was at that time a child under the age of 13 years.
 H. The Accused had done the above to child in her home when the rest of her family members were not around.
 I. The Accused made admissions in his caution interview as per attached [not provided].
 
 
4. The court then checked with your counsel, on your behalf, on whether or not you admitted the above summary of facts. Your counsel told the court that you admitted the prosecution’s summary of facts. Your counsel also said that you admitted the particulars of the offences in count 1 and 2 in the information. As a result of the above, the court found you guilty as charged on both counts in the information, and convicted you accordingly on those counts.
 
 
5. The prosecution said, you were a first offender at the age of 54 years old. Your antecedent report was considered. You were married with four children, aged between 40 and 23 years old. You resided at Yacata Village and was a subsistence farmer. The victim’s impact report was considered. You did not challenge the above reports. Your counsel then submitted a well prepared written plea in mitigation. The same also contained your sentence submission. The prosecution also submitted their written sentence submission. I have carefully considered the papers submitted by you and the prosecution, and I have listened very carefully to you two’s verbal submissions.
 
 
6. We will discuss the “rape” offence (count no. 2) first, as it is the more serious of the two offences. Of the sexual offences, “rape” is at the top of the criminal calendar. It is the unwarranted invasion of person’s body and dignity. It is the worst form of sexual assault. It invades the privacy of a person and unwanted intrusion into a person’s dignity. Society views it seriously, and through their representative in Parliament, had prescribed the maximum penalty of life imprisonment (section 207 (1) of the Crimes Act 2009). This crime, in the past, had only been prevalent amongst adults, that is, those over 18 years old. However, a disturbing trend had been witnessed in the courts. More and more, we have seen that the victims of this crime are increasingly the children of this country.
 
 
7. So much so that in Gordon Aitcheson v The State, Criminal Petition CAV 012 of 2018, the Supreme Court of Fiji, on 2 November 2018, the President of the Supreme Court of Fiji, His Lordship the Hon Chief Justice Mr. Anthony Gates, said as follows:
 
 
 
 “[23] The increases are obvious. Even this court now has many more of such cases coming before it. This sittings is also remarkable for the number of such cases listed for consideration.
 
 
 
 [24] The increasing prevalence of these crimes, crimes characterised by disturbing aggravating circumstances, means the court must consider widening the tariff for rape against children. It will be for judges to exercise their discretion taking into account the age group of these child victims. I do not for myself believe that that judicial discretion should be shackled. But it is obvious to state that crimes like these on the youngest children are the most abhorrent.
 
 
 
 [25] The tariff previously set in Raj v The State [2014] FJSC12 CAV0003.2014 (20th August 2014) should now be between 11-20 years imprisonment. Much will depend upon the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, considerations of remorse, early pleas, and finally time spent on remand awaiting trial for the final sentence outcome. The increased tariff represents the denunciation of the courts in the strongest terms.
 
 
 [26] It is entirely possible that the sentencing judge when confronted with a particularly heinous rape as in State v Isoa Rainima Crim. Case HAC 064 of 2017S 25th October 2018 may exceed the tariff when assessing all of the factors. That was a case committed against an adult victim. The total sentence came to 23 years imprisonment with a non- parole period of 20 years.”
 
 
8. “Sexual Assault”, contrary to section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009 carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
9. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows:
 (i) Breach of Trust. You are related to the child victim and you are her grandfather. As such, your role was to look after and care for her. In a village setting, that was expected of you. However, you abused the trust she had in you. Instead of looking after her, you committed the offences against her. This was done when no-one was around. You forced her to take her clothes off and committed the offences against her. She was 6 years old at the time.
 (ii) Rape of a child. We have said before and we will say again that we, the courts, will keep on passing heavy prison sentence against child rapists, as a warning to others.
 (iii) By offending against the child, you had shown no regards to her right as a child, her right as a human being and her right not to be harmed. You also had caused heartache and sadness to her family.
 
 
10. The mitigating factors were as follows:
 (i) At the age of 55 years, this was your first offence;
 (ii) You had been remanded in custody, awaiting trial, for approximately 1 year 3 days from 17 November 2017;
 (iii) Although you pleaded guilty to the charges approximately 1 year after first call in the High Court, you nevertheless saved some court time;
 (iv) You co-operated with the police during the interview process, by admitting the offence.
 
 
11. I will start with the rape offence, as it is the more serious of the two. On count no. 2, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 16 years imprisonment. For time already served while remanded in custody, I deduct 1 year 1 week, leaving a balance of 14 years 51 weeks. For your late guilty plea and for co- operating with police during the interview, I deduct 51 weeks, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment. For being a first offender at the age of 55 years, I deduct 2 years, leaving a balance of 12 years imprisonment. On count no. 2 (rape), I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
12. On the sexual assault charge (count no. 1), I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment.
 
 
13. The summary of your sentences are as follows:
 (i) Count no. 1 : Sexual Assault - 5 years imprisonment. 
 (ii) Count no. 2 : Rape - 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
14. Because of the totality principle of sentencing, I direct that the above sentences be made concurrent to each other, making a final total sentence of 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
15. Mr. Mataitoga Rogoivosa, for sexually offending against the child complainant on 1 November 2017 at Yacata Island in the Northern Division, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
16. Pursuant to section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the purpose of the above sentence is to punish you in a manner that is just in all the circumstances; to protect the community from people like you; to deter other people like you and to signify that the court and the community denounce what you did to the child complainant on 1 November 2017.
 
 
17. The child complainant’s name is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.
 
 
18. Pursuant to section 26 of the Domestic Violence Act 2009, I make a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order against the Accused to ensure the safety and well-being of the complainant.
 
 
19. You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

62,790,71338,"SENTENCE

1. You, Salesh Sharma and Parmend Sharma are to be sentenced upon pleading guilty to the charge of Assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

2. The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for 5 years.

3. It was revealed that both of you are brothers. The Complainant is the wife of Parmend Sharma and the sister in law of Salesh Sharma. On the 11th of December 2010 you, Parmend Sharma left home for work and didn't return home. It was revealed that you went to drink beer with Salesh Sharma and slept at your parent's house. The following day the Complainant came looking for you and later both of you assaulted her. You, Salesh Sharma assaulted the Complainant with a sugar cane and you, Parmend Sharma punched her on face. The Complainant's parents came and stopped the fight. The Complainant has received injuries according to the medical report. Both of you were under the influence of liquor.

4. It appears that both of you got together and assaulted the Complainant. The Complainant received bruises on her buttocks, abrasions on left upper chest and tenderness on left forearm. You assaulted her despite the relationship you have with her and thereby this incident amounts to an act of domestic violence.

5. In mitigation you, Salesh Sharma said that you will not re offend and said that you reconciled with the complainant. You, Parmend Sharma apologized to court and promised that this would be your first and the last offence. You said that you reconciled with the complainant. Further you said you are the sole breadwinner of the family.

6. In this case I pick my starting point as 12 months since this is an offence of domestic violence. For the aggravating circumstances I mentioned above I enhance the sentences for each of you by 6 months. For the mitigatory circumstances I reduce the sentences by 9 months. 

7. You, Salesh Sharma have one previous conviction in 2006. However I decide to disregard it and consider you as a first offender. You Parmend Sharma have no previous convictions. Further I have considered the fact that you saved the court's time by pleading guilty at the very out set. Having considered the circumstances of this case I decide to suspend the sentences imposed on both of you.

8. Accordingly I impose 9 months imprisonment on each of you and suspend the sentences for three years.

9. Further in pursuant to Section 24 of the Domestic Violence Decree I make a Domestic Violence Restraining order against both of you. 

10. I order that both of you should refrain from committing any of the following domestic violence acts against the Complainant.

i. physical injury or threatening physical injury

ii. sexual abuse or threatening sexual abuse

iii. damaging or threatening to damage property of the complainant

iv. threatening, intimidating or harassing

v. persistently behaving in an abusive, cruel, inhuman, degrading, provocative or offensive manner

vi. causing or allowing a child to see or hear any of the violence above 

vii. causing another person to do any of the violence above.

63,791,284123,"S E N T E N C E
 
  
• Mr. Pajiliai Bale, you have been charged with one count of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and one count of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for these two counts on the 31st of May 2017 and 01st of December 2017 respectively. Having satisfied that you have pleaded guilty on your own free will and understood the consequence of your plea of guilty, I now convict you for each of these two counts as charged. 
 
 
• According to the summary of facts, which was submitted by the prosecution and admitted by you in open court, you have committed these crimes on the victim while she came for a family gathering at her grandfather’s place. You are related to her as her cousin. You were staying with your grandfather at his house. You were watching TV with other kids, including the victim in a room while the elders were having their gathering. At that point of time, you went closer to the victim and licked her vagina. You then penetrate her vagina with your finger. You told her not to tell anyone. 
 
 
• This is a case of sexual exploitation of a child by a known relative within her own family environment. She is your cousin. The victim was 8 years old at the time this crime took place. The family environment is the most protective and appropriate environment for a child to grow up with confidence and safety. Close family members and relatives are the most trusted and dependable people surrounded during the developmental stages of a child. Therefore, sexually assaulting a child within her own family environment by a known family member is one of the outrageous forms of sexual crime. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this offence, it is my opinion that such offenders must be dealt with severe and harsh punishment. Hence, the purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence and protection of community. Moreover, the court must demonstrate in sentencing that the offenders of this nature are socially abhorrent. 
 
 
• Hon. Chief Justice Gates in Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV0003.2014 (20 August 2014) held that the tariff for rape of a child is between 10 -16 years’ imprisonment period. 
 
 
• Justice Madigan in State v Epeli Ratabacaca Laca - Sentence [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC252.2011 (14 November 2012) has expounded the tariff for the offence of Sexual Assault as between 2 years to 8 years’ imprisonment, where his Lordship held that: 
 

 “The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment. It is a reasonably new offence, created in February 2010 and no tariffs have been set, but this Court did say in Abdul Kaiyum HAC 160 of 2010 that the range of sentences should be between two to eight years. The top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus. The bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks.
 
 A very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the United Kingdom's Legal Guidelines for Sentencing. Those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories:
 
 
 Category 1 (the most serious)
 
 Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim.
 
 
 Category 2
  
• Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;
 
• Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
• Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 

Category 3
 
Contact between part of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia)”.
 
  
• The victim was eight years old at that time. It is clear that a crime of this nature adversely affects a child of this age. Hence, I find the level of harm is substantially high in this crime. 
 
 
•  You have committed this disgraceful sexual crime on the victim in very opportunistic manner. You have exploited her young age and immaturity in order to satisfy your sexual greediness. I accordingly find the decree of culpability in this offending is substantially high. 
 
 
• In view of the seriousness of this crime, and the level of harm and culpability, I select twelve (12) years as the starting point for the offence of Rape and three (3) years for the offence of Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• You have blatantly breached the trust reposed in you by the victim as her cousin. The age difference between you and the victim was about seventeen (17) years at the time of this crime took place. I consider these factors as aggravating circumstances of this crime. 
 
 
• The learned counsel for the defence submitted in mitigation about your family circumstances. However, the family background of the offenders of this nature has very minimal mitigatory value. 
 
 
• You are a first offender. You are 19 years old. Therefore, it is appropriate to give you some substantial discount for your previous good character. 
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for these two counts at the early stages of this proceeding. By doing that you have save the time of the court and also prevent the victim to recalling all these traumatic ordeal that she had gone through. 
 
 
• In view of the above discussed aggravating circumstances, I increased two (2) years to reach interim imprisonment of fourteen (14) years for the offence of Rape and five (5) years for Sexual Assault. I reduce one (1) year for your previous unblemished character and three (3) years for your early plea of guilt. Your final sentence has now reached to ten (10) years of imprisonment for Rape and one (1) year for Sexual Assault. 
 
 
• Having considered the seriousness of this crime, the purpose of this sentence, your age and opportunities for rehabilitation, I find eight (8) years of non-parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence. Hence, you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight (8) years pursuant to Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 

Head Sentence 
  
• Accordingly, I sentence you for a period of ten (10) years imprisonment for the offence of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1), (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act and one (1) year imprisonment for the offence of Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act. I further order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight (8) years. Both sentences to be served concurrently. 
 

Actual Period of Sentence
  
• You have been in remand custody for this case for a period of nearly nine (9) months as you were not granted bail by the court. In pursuant of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I consider the period of nine (9) months as a period of imprisonment that have already been served by you. 
 
 
• Accordingly your actual sentencing period is nine (9) years and three (3) months of imprisonment, with seven (7) years and three (03) months of non-parole period. 
 
 
• Since this incident involves with domestic violence, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the Domestic Violence Act. I accordingly make a permanent domestic violence restraining order against the accused with standard non-molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to section 24 and 28 of the Domestic Violence Act. The above domestic violence restraining order will be in force until this court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it. Furthermore, if you breached this restraining order, you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of section 77 of the Domestic Violence Act. 
 
 
• Thirty (30) days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

64,792,80837,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] On 23 March 2004 the Appellant was convicted and sentenced by the Nadi Magistrates’ Court as follows:
1. Burglary - 12 months imprisonment
2. Rape - 6 years imprisonment
3. Unnatural offence - 3 years imprisonment
4. Robbery with Violence- 6 years imprisonment
5. Wrongful confinement- 12 months imprisonment

Counts 2, 3 and 4 were to be served consecutively, Counts 1 and 5 concurrently. The Appellant was therefore sentenced to a total of 15 years imprisonment.

[2] The brief facts were that at about 11 p.m. the Appellant went to the complainant’s residence. He climbed a fence and entered the house. The complainant was in bed asleep. The Appellant, without saying anything, began to have sexual intercourse with her. When she realised what was happening she began to shout. The Appellant who had brought a 4 inch nail with him held it to her neck and told her to be quiet. He then raped and sodomised her. When he had finished, he asked her for money for beer. She offered him $100 however he took another $360 as well. He then forced the complainant to accompany him to a shop to buy beer. On arrival at the shop the complainant raised the alarm. The Appellant ran off but was later apprehended.

[3] Following his arrest the Appellant co-operated fully with the police. He admitted the offence and said that he had been acquainted with the complainant. He pleaded guilty to the five charges. He had six previous convictions, four for larceny and one for robbery with violence in 2001 for which he had been sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment.

[4] The Appellant appealed against sentence to the High Court at Lautoka. On 29 October 2004 at a somewhat informal hearing the judge told the Appellant that the sentence of 15 years was wrong and would be reduced, probably to 9 years.

[5] Judgment was delivered later on the same day. The judge began with the offence of rape and took as his starting point the 7 year period established in Mohammed Kasim v. The State (Cr. App. 21/97). In the judge’s view the circumstances in which the rape was committed aggravated the offence and therefore 9 years imprisonment was warranted.

[6] The judge then turned to the remaining offences. Given that they all arose from the same incident he took the view that the sentences imposed should have been concurrent. That was plainly correct. He also took the view that the terms imposed in respect of the other offences were not wrong in principle. We agree. The overall result was that the Appellant’s 15 year sentence was reduced to 9.

[7] On 8 September 2005 the Appellant filed a second appeal against his sentence to this court. When granting him leave, the President pointed out to the Appellant that since this was a second appeal it was confined to points of law. Unless the sentence imposed by the High Court was unlawful or passed in consequence of an error of law, no appeal lay (Section 22 (1) A(a) of the Court of Appeal Act – Cap. 12).

[8] The Appellant’s submissions to us were largely repetitive of the grounds originally filed. He again pointed out that he had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, thus sparing the complainant the ordeal of giving evidence. He suggested that the 9 years imprisonment offended the totality principle, that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive, especially in comparison to sentences imposed on offenders who had committed more serious crimes. The Appellant also suggested that he was so intoxicated at the time as to be temporarily insane.

[9] So far as the sodomy was concerned the Appellant reminded us that the High Court at Lautoka had recently ruled that the criminalisation of sodomy was discriminatory and therefore contrary to Section 38 (2) (a) of the Constitution. This submission can be dealt with shortly. The Appellant sodomised the complainant against her will; that is not permitted by any clause in the Constitution.

[10] The remaining grounds of appeal and the arguments adduced in their support do not, with one exception, in our view give rise to any conclusion that the sentence passed was unlawful or passed in consequence of an error of law.

[11] The only matter which gives us concern is that, as explained by the judge, he arrived at the conclusion that the head sentence should be one of 9 years imprisonment because of the aggravating circumstances. Unfortunately he did not specify exactly what he took those aggravating circumstances to be. Neither did he mention, nor apparently take into account, the Appellant’s mitigation which was an early guilty plea which, in a case of this type, is a particularly significant mitigating factor. In our view it would have been proper to discount the sentence on that ground by two years.

[12] While we are aware that the resulting sentence of seven years imprisonment might, in the light of the whole of the Appellant’s conduct, be regarded as somewhat lenient, we do not think that we would be justified in interfering with the judge’s estimation of the degree of aggravation which resulted in a head sentence of 9 years. 

RESULT
Appeal allowed: overall sentence reduced to 7 years imprisonment.

65,793,80529,"SENTENCE

1. In a judgment delivered on 28th May 2010, the court found you guilty as charged on one count of ""indecent assault"", contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 17 (ie. count No.1), two counts of ""rape"", contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (ie. count Nos. 2 and 3), and one count of ""incest"", contrary to section 178(1) of the Penal Code (ie. count No.6). You were convicted as charged on all those counts.

2. The brief facts of the case were as follows. On 9th November 1995, you married Mele Duribalavu. On 15th October 1996, you two had your first child, Seruwaia Mafi, the complainant. She was your eldest daughter. You then had two more girls from your wife, until you two separated in 2005. The custody of the girls were given to you. In January 2006, you and the three girls resided at 39 Wailea Street Vatuwaqa. Your abuse on Seruwaia started at this address. Between the 26th and 27th January 2006, you indecently assaulted Seruwaia, who was 9 years 3 months old at the time. You indecently kissed her, touched her breast and fondled her vagina.

3. You then moved to another residence, at Lot 7 Vusavusa Road, Vatuwaqa in February 2006. Between the 11th and 18th February 2006, your abuse on Seruwaia reached another level. One night you woke Seruwaia from her sleep, told her to take off her clothes, then you raped her by forcefully inserting you erected penis into her vagina, until you ejaculated. Seruwaia did nothing and said nothing. You then next shifted to 140 Fletcher Road, Vatuwaqa with the three girls. At that address, you again forced yourself on Seruwaia, between the 19th and 28 February 2006. You forcefully inserted your erected penis into Seruwaia's vagina in the bathroom. You carried on for about 3 minutes, until Seruwaia pleaded for you to stop, as it was hurting her. You did stop, had your bath and went out of the bathroom.

4. In May 2006, you next moved in with a pastor at Namara Settlement, Newtown. You took your three girls with you. Between the 1st and 31st May 2006, you again forced yourself on Seruwaia, who was aged 9 years 7 months, at the time. One night, you told Seruwaia to take off her pants, you then massaged your penis with oil, and then forcefully inserted it into her vagina, until you ejaculated.

5. The court has carefully read your antecedent report, and your well prepared written plea in mitigation. It has also read the victim's impact report. The court noted you are first offender, at the age of 42 years old. It also noted that you are divorced, with three young daughters. You are a pastor in a Christian church, and you are very remorseful for the offences.

6. You have committed three sexual offences against your daughter. In terms of seriousness, the rape offence is the most serious, followed by incest and then indecent assault. We will begin with the offence of rape.

7. Rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Since Seruwaia Mafi was aged 9 years 4 months at the time of the rape, the case is really about the rape of a child. The tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 13 years imprisonment. See State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; Tevita Poese v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0010 of 2005, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Fong Toy, Criminal Appeal Case No. HAA 003 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v Nacanieli Marawa, Criminal Case No. HAC 016 of 2003, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence passed will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

8. Committing ""incest"" against a child under 13 years carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The tariff for incest against a child under 13 years old is a sentence between 10 to 14 years imprisonment: Babu Ram v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0023 of 2004L, High Court, Lautoka. The actual sentence will again depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors.

9. The maximum sentence for ""indecent assault"" is 5 years imprisonment. The tariff is a sentence between 1 to 4 years imprisonment: Ratu Penioni Rakota v The State, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 068 of 2002, High Court, Suva; State v Viliame Tamani, Criminal Case No. HAC 007 of 2003S, High Court, Suva. Again the actual sentence passed, will depend on the presence or otherwise of strong mitigating and/or aggravating factors. 

10. The aggravating factors in this case were as follows: 

(i) Serious breach of parental trust. Seruwaia was 9 years 4 months old when you indecently assaulted her, and then raped her twice in February 2006. She was already traumatized by the break up of your family in 2005. She looked to you for fatherly support and guidance, in her young life. She trusted you as a father. You were supposed to respond in kind. You were supposed to guide and counselled her to become a strong and confident young girl. However, you did exactly the opposite. You ruined her world by indecently assaulting her, and raping her twice. Then you committed incest on her.

(ii) Your daughter Seruwaia appears to be emotionally scarred for life. According to the victim impact report, she repeatedly has emotional mood swings. At times, she cries without a reason. She has very low self esteem. She is frightened of you, and frighten most of the time. She gets so angry easily, and wants to be left alone on most occasions. She stares a lot. Her school grades have deteriorated. She shuts down when questioned. On occasions, she changes from a happy little girl to an angry one, and then a dump one.

(iii) According to her medical report, dated 12th June 2009, at the age of 12 years 8 months old, Seruwaia is sexually active. She has been touched by a cousin, and according to the report, a shopkeeper in Rewa Street performed oral sex on her. These are the by-products of your offending. You turned your own daughter into this kind of world. Instead of living her life as a young innocent girl, she is now being exposed to the above kind of world. In a sense, your have ruined her life as a child, given your offending. 

(iv) Through your offending, you have shown a total disregard to Seruwaia's right to live a happy and peaceful life, not only as a child, but also when she grows into the adult world.

11. The mitigating factors were as follows:

(i) At the age of 42 years old, this is your first offence.

(ii) You pleaded guilty to the indecent assault charge (count No.1) at the beginning of the trial.

(iii) You are remorseful.

(iv) You have spent a few weeks in prison, while being remanded in custody.

12. On the rape charge, I start with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 17 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 2 years from the 17 years, leaving a balance of 15 years imprisonment.

13. On the incest charge, I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I add 4 years, making a total of 15 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year from the 15 years, leaving a balance of 14 years imprisonment.

14. On the indecent assault charge, I start with a sentence of 2 years prison. I add 2 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 4 years. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 1 year, leaving a balance of 3 years.

15. I sentence you as follows:

Count No. 1 - 
indecent assault -
3 years imprisonment
Count No. 2 - 
Rape -
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 3 - 
rape -
15 years imprisonment
Count No. 6 - 
incest -
14 years imprisonment

16. Given the principle of the totality of sentence, I order all the above sentences to be made concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 15 years imprisonment.

17. To assist Seruwaia recover from her ordeal, her name, including that of her father, are suppressed permanently, to protect her privacy.

",1,0,0,1,1,sentence,1388
66,794,79359,"JUDGMENT

On 27th February 2002, the Appellant was charged with two counts of Incest and one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm. The charges read as follows:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

INCEST: Contrary to section 178(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

SIKELI KORO between 1990 and 2000 at Rakiraki in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of [the complainant] who was to his knowledge his daughter.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

INCEST: Contrary to section 178(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

SIKELI KORO on the 19th day of October, 2000 at Rakiraki in the Western Division had carnal knowledge of [the complainant] who was to his knowledge his daughter.

THIRD COUNT

Statement of Offence

ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM: Contrary to section 245 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

SIKELI KORO on the 19th day of October, 2000 at Rakiraki in the Western Division assaulted [the complainant] thereby occasioning her actual bodily harm.

The Appellant, who is 52 years old, appeared in the Ba Magistrate’s Court on the 27th of February and pleaded guilty on all three counts. The facts were outlined. The prosecutor said that the Appellant is married to Adi Quini Marama with whom he had 6 children. The complainant was their eldest child, and was born on 19th December 1974. In 1990, the Appellant started to have a sexual relationship with the complainant. She was then 16 years old. This relationship continued for the next 10 years. The complainant gave birth to two children, now aged 6 years and 17 months respectively. On 19th October 2000, the Appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, and also assaulted her causing her injuries. She reported the matter to the police on 22nd October 2000, and on 14th January 2001, the Appellant made admissions to the police about his incestuous relationship with his daughter. The Appellant was arrested on the 26th of February and charged with the offences.

The Appellant admitted the facts, but said he was not sure if the children of his daughter were his children. The learned Magistrate said that the offences were proved without evidence of parentage of the children and convicted the Appellant as charged.

The Appellant had no previous convictions. In mitigation he said he had asked his wife and his daughter for forgiveness and said that his daughter was now married. He said he was looking after her two children, and that he was an unemployed villager who planted dalo and cassava to meet the education expenses for the children. He asked for forgiveness. His wife confirmed that she had forgiven him.

The learned Magistrate said that the 10 year period covered numerous occasions of incest and should not have been put into one count. However he imposed the harshest sentence he could within his jurisdiction and sentenced the Appellant to 5 years imprisonment each on Counts 1 and 2, to be served consecutively, and 2 months imprisonment on Count 3 to be served concurrently with Count 1. The total length of the sentence to be served is 10 years imprisonment.

The Appellant now appeals against the sentence saying that the complainant had been a “willing partner”, that the charge was defective, that his plea was not unequivocal, and that the sentence was harsh and excessive. He said that no discount had been given for his guilty plea, and previous good record.

I deal with each of these grounds in turn.

Consent of Complainant

Although, an appeal against conviction is not normally permitted after a guilty plea, it may be entertained if the Appellant claims the plea was a nullity, or the offence was not known in law, or where the proceedings were otherwise invalid.

In this appeal, the Appellant submits that the offence was not disclosed by the facts, because the complainant consented to his incestuous acts. He is mistaken. Section 178(1) and (2) of the Penal Code provide as follows:

“(1) Any male person who has carnal knowledge of a female person, who is to his knowledge his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother, is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for seven years:

Provided that if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female person is under the age of thirteen years, the offender shall be liable to imprisonment for life.

(2) It is immaterial that the carnal knowledge was had with the consent of the female person.” (my emphasis)

The consent of the complainant is irrelevant to the charge. This ground of appeal fails.

The charge on Count 1

The Appellant submits that the charges were defective. The learned Magistrate suggested as much in his sentencing remarks. At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant did not develop this argument. However I requested State counsel to address me on the question of whether Count 1 was duplicitous, because it purported to charge more than one offence in a ten year period. Counsel made comprehensive and well-researched submissions for which I am grateful.

Section 120(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides:

“Where more than one offence is charged in a charge or information, a description of each offence so charged shall be set out in a separate paragraph of the charge or information called a count.”

Where the prosecution is confronted with evidence of a long history of offending, it has, traditionally, been faced with several options. One has been to “pick the best” and to proceed with two or three counts instead of laying multiple counts. Another has been the procedure under section 216 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Under the provisions of that section, a court may, on convicting a person, with the consent of the defendant and the prosecutor, take other untried offences “of a like character” into account, in sentencing. The defendant must have consented to this procedure in writing in accordance with the prescribed form scheduled to the Code. Another option is to lay multiple counts over a long period of time, specifying details of particular incidents of offending. These options have been unhelpful where the offending has taken place over a long period of time, and where separate acts of offending are indistinguishable from each other. This problem is very common in cases of sexual offences, where witnesses are unable to say with any certainty, when separate offences were committed, and on how many occasions.

In R v Shore (1989) 89 Cr. App. R, the defendant was charged with four counts of indecent assault against four girls, over several years. The evidence was that the defendant, a school teacher had committed indecent acts on girls during P.E. lessons, on school trips and at swimming classes. The prosecution did not tie the evidence down to particular counts, leading evidence instead of multiple offending during the time period alleged. The Court of Appeal held, on appeal against convictions, that this was unobjectionable because the prosecution witnesses could not identify particular incidents with any certainty, and because the defendant was not prejudiced.

However in R -v- Rackman (1997) Crim. L.R. 592, convictions for sexual assaults on children over a long period of time were quashed on the ground that the trial judge should have allowed an application for better identification of specific incidents to which the counts related. The Court of Appeal held that an indictment should be drawn with as much particularity as possible because failure to do so creates possible ambiguity in both conviction and sentence. Archbold (1999 ed para 1.132) states as follows:

“Where a child speaks of a number of incidents with no distinguishing features, a convenient course, in order to establish the systematic conduct of the accused is to have a number of counts, each, apart from the first, alleging “on an occasion other than that alleged in [the previous counts]”. The overriding principle is that the number of counts in the indictment should fairly reflect the alleged criminality ... otherwise sentencing problems may arise. It should not be too difficult in most cases to settle an indictment which steers a safe course between prejudicial uncertainty and overloading.”

The New Zealand Court of Appeal in R -v- Accused (1993) 1 NZLR 385 approved the “representative charge” procedure. In that case, the Crown charged the defendant with 11 counts of sexual offences against three women. The offences were alleged to have been committed when the women were children, and the indictment did not specify particular dates. The trial judge held that the charges lacked sufficient particularity, directed not guilty verdicts and reserved the case for the Court of Appeal. It was held by the Court of Appeal, that there was an established practice of using specimen counts in New Zealand. That practice was followed where witnesses could not say more than that the conduct alleged occurred a number of times over a long period of time. However, each count must be as specific as is reasonably possible in the circumstances. Referring to a list of cases of child sexual abuse, referred to the New Zealand Court of Appeal all of which had adopted the specimen charge practice, the Court said (per Cooke P) at p.390:

“The evil of this kind of offending appears to be virtually world wide. While the Courts cannot solve the social problem, a response to it in the Courts invoking a technical legal doctrine of some obscurity seems unsatisfying.”

The High Court of Australia in S -v- R [1989] HCA 66; (1989) 168 CLR 266 took a different view. In that case, a father was charged with 3 counts of unlawful carnal knowledge of his daughter. Each count specified one act within a 12 month period. The complainant said that her father had committed sexual acts with her from the age of 9 or 10, and had sexual intercourse with her continuously, from the age of 14 to 17. The High Court held (per Brennan, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) that, applying what the Court called the doctrine of latent ambiguity, the Crown could not lead evidence of a number of offences, any one of which constituted the offence charged, and invite the jury to convict on them.

The following passage was cited, with approval by Brennan and Toohey JJ, from a decision of Dixon J in Johnson -v- Miller [1937] HCA 77; (1937) 59 CLR 467, 489:

“..... the question is whether the prosecutor should not be required to identify one of a number of sets of facts, each amounting to the commission of the same offence as that on which the charge is based. In my opinion he clearly should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, mater or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge.”

Toohey J then explained:

“Of course this does not mean that the prosecution must specify a particular date as the occasion on which it relies. But it does mean that, as soon as it appears that a count in the indictment is equally capable of referring to a number of occasions, each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the count, the prosecution should identify the occasion which is said to give rise to the offence charged.”

The convictions were quashed by the majority, Brennan J dissenting on the basis that although the charge was defective, he thought there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice.

Finally the Canadian Courts (as discussed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R -v- Accused supra) have adopted the principle that where the offending took place over a certain period, and cannot be individually particularised, all the offending is part of one transaction, and can be alleged in one count (R -v- Hulan (1970) 1 CCC 36 R -v- German (1989) 51 CCC (3d) 175).

Having considered these decisions from courts around the Commonwealth, it appears that there is a need to balance two possibly competing principles. One is that the prosecution should not be prevented from prosecuting repeat offenders simply because witnesses (understandably) cannot particularise specific incidents and cannot say more than that the offending continued over a lengthy period of time. The other principle is that an accused person must not be tried on the basis of charges which are ambiguous and render the preparation of a defence difficult or even impossible because of lack of particularity. The balancing of these principles must depend on the evidence led in a particular case, and the wording of particular charges. However, as a matter of practice, it seems good sense to adopt the New Zealand procedure of specimen charges where the incidents of offending are indistinguishable from each other, and where it is open to the court to convict as long as it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, on at least one occasion, in the period alleged, committed the act alleged. As to whether a count in a particular case contains “such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to the nature of the offence alleged” as is required by section 119 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that is a question to be considered and ruled upon, on the basis of the circumstances of each case. Further, it is open to the court to require the prosecution in any case, to state which incident in particular, is referred to in the charge. A good practice might be to refer to the count as a specimen or representative count, as is the practice in New Zealand.

Returning therefore to the charge on Count 1 in this case, it is evident that the prosecution was laying a “specimen count.” The period alleged stretched over 10 years. The facts outlined referred to a long relationship over a 10 year period during which two children were born of the complainant. Although the prosecution might have been wiser to lay several counts over a 2/3 year period each, I accept State counsel’s submissions that on the facts, it was probably impossible to further particularise the allegations. If the matter had proceeded to trial however, it is highly likely that the charge would have been amended by the prosecution to contain more specific information about dates. There may have been several counts stretching over the 10 year period. However, this was a case of a guilty plea. The Appellant admitted the multiple offending. As to possible prejudice to the Appellant therefore, the fact that he pleaded guilty to the two counts of incest, and agreed to the facts which disclosed multiple offending over the 10 year period, shows that there was no ambiguity. There is no suggestion on the record that the Appellant disputed the sexual acts over the 10 year period. On the facts of this case, and on the basis of the fact that there was a clear unequivocal guilty plea, I consider that the Appellant was not prejudiced by lack of particularity and that he was given reasonable information about the nature of the allegations. Finally, in his interview with the police, the Appellant himself was unable to recall details of specific acts of sexual intercourse over the 10 year period, with his daughter. This ground of appeal is unsuccessful.

The plea

The charges were read, and explained to the Appellant. However he was not told of his right to counsel. Although there was an undoubted breach of section 28(1)(d) of the Constitution, the record suggests no resulting prejudice. The learned Magistrate ensured that the Appellant was pleading guilty of his own free will and that the police did not force him to plead guilty. Further the facts were clearly outlined, and the caution interview of the Appellant tendered. That interview discloses a clear and unequivocal confession of repeated acts of incest with his daughter. He said that the acts of sexual intercourse with her started in 1990 and that he could not remember how many times they recurred.

In the circumstances I consider that the plea was unequivocal and that the Appellant was not prejudiced by the failure of the learned Magistrate to advise him of his right to counsel.

Sentence

The learned Magistrate clearly disapproved of the “specimen” Count 1, and sentenced on the basis of one incident of offending. He said in his sentencing remarks:

“If this case had been properly investigated then the accused would have been condemned to jail for the rest of his life as Count 1 covers a period of 10 years when in my view it should have had many different counts.”

The sentence was 5 years on Count 1 and 5 years on Count 2. It follows that he treated the offending on each count as single acts calling for the same sentence. In the case of “specimen counts”, the question of sentencing can be a difficult one. Does the sentencer sentence on the basis of multiple offending, or on the basis of one incident of offending? In Clark -v- R (1996) 2 Cr. App. R(s), the English Court of Appeal said that in such a case, the sentencer must not sentence the offender on the basis that he was guilty of further offences of a similar nature unless the offender has admitted those other offences. In that case, the defendant had been charged on one count of indecent assault on a male person. The period alleged was a two year period. The count was a specimen count because the evidence showed multiple offending during that period. The trial judge sentenced on the basis that there had been a series of assaults over the two year period. On appeal the Court of Appeal said at page 356:

“... the appellant was not convicted of the offences making up the series, nor did he admit them or request the court to take them into consideration. Therefore, .. we are driven to the conclusion that this appellant, having been convicted on a single count particularising a single act, and not having admitted any offence beyond that, can only be sentenced on the basis of that single act.”

Brennan J in S -v- R (supra) at pp.271-272 thought it unrealistic to insist on convicting and sentencing for one act only, when multiple acts during the period were indistinguishable from each other:

“It is in my respectful view, fanciful to suggest that the verdict could not be returned because some jurors were satisfied that one act of intercourse occurred, others that another act occurred and others again that a third act occurred within a relevant period. The real choice for the jury was to be satisfied that the series of incestuous acts occurred. The jury could not have found that a particular act in the series occurred and another did not. There is nothing by which the jurors might have distinguished between one act and another.”

This makes good sense. If the witness can only give evidence of multiple acts of incest over a long period of time, why should the court accept that some acts occurred and others did not? And, for the purpose of sentencing, doesn’t it follow that if the court has accepted the multiple offending, then the sentence should also reflect such offending?

In any event, in this case the Appellant admitted multiple acts of incest. In principle therefore on the basis of the decision in Clark (supra) the learned Magistrate could have sentenced him on the basis of such multiple offending. However, he did not. Instead he sentenced on the basis that Count 1 referred to one act of incest, and Count 2 to another. His sentence on each count was identical.

In Fiji, other similar cases have resulted in total sentences of 5 years imprisonment. In Aseri Koroi -v- the State HAA0055.2002, Singh J referred to the guideline sentencing case of incest in Attorney-General’s Reference No. 1 of 1989 (1990) Cr. App. R. 141 and said that cases of incest should be divided into three broad categories. The first is incest with a girl over the age of 16, in respect of which sentences should range between 3 years imprisonment (where there was a degree of harm caused to the girl) and a nominal penalty where the girl was a willing partner and the degree of corruption was low. The second category is incest with girls between 13 to 16 years of age, where the same principles apply and where the range of sentence is between 5 years and 3 years imprisonment. In cases of guilty pleas, 2 to 4 years imprisonment would be appropriate. The third category of cases, is incest with a girl under the age of 13. This category covers cases of the corruption of young children whose will might be easily overborne by a parent. A term of 6 years imprisonment might be appropriate in such cases. In Aseri Koroi (supra) his Lordship reduced a 9 year term to a 5 year concurrent term for 5 counts of incest.

The rape of one’s own daughter or granddaughter naturally attracts a much heavier sentence, the tariff for rape commencing at 10 years imprisonment for the rape of children. However the Appellant was not charged with rape. He was charged with incest. The tariff for incest with a 16 year old girl ranges from 2 years imprisonment to 4 years imprisonment. The learned Magistrate did not indicate his starting point, nor did he refer to the tariff for incest cases. However, I would choose 3 years as an appropriate starting point because of the length of the relationship, and the age of the complainant. There was no evidence of psychological harm, but the facts disclosed that the Appellant was angry because the complainant began a relationship with another man. The complainant’s pregnancy was another aggravating factor, although the Appellant is not sure that he is the father of the children.

Mitigating factors were the guilty plea, the previous good character and the willingness to support the complainant’s (and possibly the Appellant’s) children. In the circumstances, a term of 5 years imprisonment is not inappropriate for one count although it is higher than the tariff. However, ordering consecutive terms offend the totality principle. If the Appellant is sentenced to 10 years in total for 2 counts of incest, this would be contrary to the trend of sentencing in incest cases generally. State counsel concedes the appeal against sentence must succeed, saying that while a 5 year term might reflect the duration of the offending on Count 1, a similar term on Count 2 is difficult to justify. I agree.

In the circumstances I allow the appeal against sentence. The Appellant’s sentence is varied as follows:

Count 1: -5 years imprisonment;
Count 2: -3 years imprisonment;
Count 3: -2 months imprisonment.

All sentences are to be served concurrently with each other, and run from the date of the Appellant’s conviction on 27th February 2002.

Result

The appeal against conviction is dismissed. The appeal against sentence is allowed. The Appellant’s total sentence is reduced to 5 years imprisonment.

67,795,83056,"SENTENCE

	1.	The accused has been charged with the following two offences:
FIRST COUNT

RAPE:Contrary to section 207(1) and 2(b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree no.44 of 2009

Particulars of the Offence

Pita Sereki on the 23rd May 2014 at Nasinu in the Central Division penetrated the vagina of (name suppressed), a 6 year old girl, with his finger.

SECOND COUNT

SEXUAL ASSAULT:Contrary to section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.

Particulars of the Offence

Pita Sereki on the 23rd day of May 2014 at Nasinu in the Central Division unlawfully and indecently assaulted (same victim as in Count 1) by licking her vagina.

	1.	On the 28th August 2014 in this Court, the accused entered pleas of guilty to both counts and on the 12th September 2014 he admitted a set of relevant facts put to him. On his pleas and agreement to the facts I found him guilty of both counts and convicted him of them both.
	2.	The facts agreed state that boththe accused, aged 25 and unemployed, and the victim Mere (not her real name) who is 6 years old both live in a temporary settlement in Tacirua. They are first cousins. 
	3.	On the 23rd May 2014 Mere was at home with her grandmother when the accused walked past. He spoke to her and told her to have her bath and come to his house which was two houses away. She did that and on arriving at the house the accused took her into a room made her lie on the bed and take her pants off. He then proceeded to put his finger into her vagina and licked her vagina. He took a picture of her vagina on his mobile phone. He gave her some food to eat after which she returned home. Three days later, she told her grandmother what the accused had done to her. As a result, Mere's mother and the Police were informed.In an interview under caution the accused readily admitted the two offences. 
	4.	In mitigation, counsel for the accused tells me that the accused is 26 years old, single, and has a clear record. He is educated to Form 1. At one time he worked as a juice seller earning $70 perday, money which he used to support his parents and 4 siblings who are still schooling. Counsel stresses his client's co-operation with the Police on first enquiry and his early plea of guilty when arriving at the High Court. I am told that he is remorseful and has sought forgiveness from the victim and her family. 
	5.	The tariff for rape of a child has recently been set at between 10 to 16 years imprisonment in the Court of appeal case of AnandAbhayRaj AAU 0038 of 2010.
	6.	The tariff for sexual assault is a term of imprisonment of between 2 to 8 years with the high end of the range being reserved for serious assaults involving contact between mouthand genetalia. (seeEpeli Ratabacaca LacaHAC 252 of 2011). 
	7.	Aggravating features in this particular case are first the breach of trust that Mere must have had in her cousin, a man 19 years older than she was. By abusing a 6 year old he is taking advantage of a particularly vulnerable child. It was also anaggravating feature that after these deplorable crimes were committed on a child that he would further insult her dignity by photographing her genitals. 
	8.	For the first offence of rape, I take a starting point at the bottom of the accepted tariff, a term of 10 years. For the aggravating features referred to above I add a total term of 6 years to that bringing the total term to a period of 16 years. Such a term is condign punishment for a breach of trust case where a vulnerable young child, unable to defend herself has been taken advantage of. For the accused's clear record and for the 4 months he has spent in custody for this case, I deduct one year bringing the interim total down to 15 years. For his early co-operation with the authorities and for his early plea of guilty saving the necessity for the child having to give evidence in Court, I afford the accused a reduction of 5 years bring the final sentence to a term of 10 years imprisonment. He will serve a term of 8 years before being eligible for parole. 
	9.	For the second offence of sexual assault, I take a starting point of 7 years and for all of his mitigating features referred to above I reduce that to a term of 5 years imprisonment. In accordance with the ""one transaction"" principle that sentence is to be served concurrently with the rape sentence

68,796,78707,"SENTENCE

1. Complainant victim of this case has been the wife of the accused. She was 24 years and married for last six years. On 29.01.2012 after lunch the accused asked her to take their 3 year old daughter inside the room to feed. Then the accused closed all the windows and the doors of their house in the settlement and followed her to the room. The victim wife refused, when the accused forcefully tried to have sex with her.

2. Then the accused forced her to sit on the floor and shaved her head and eye brows to reflect his dissatisfaction. She did not report this matter to the police.

3. On the following day at 7.00 pm the accused questioned the victim whether she is having any extra marital affair. During this conversation he pushed the TV rack to her. After she fell down he punched her on face and kicked her on the chest. The matter was then reported to Nabua police station and the accused was charged on following counts.

I. Indecently Annoying Any Person – Contrary to section 213(1)(b) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

II. Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm – Contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. 

4. The accused initially appeared without any legal representation and indicated his willingness to seek Legal Aid assistance. The Court granted a date to facilitate his request. On 29.05.2012 the accused represented by a counsel of Legal Aid and the accused entered a 'plea of guilt'. 

5. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree will not have any application to this case for reconciliation due to the domestic setting of the facts.

6. As per the medical report the complainant sustained multiple swellings and abrasions on her chest and left hand. Further it confirms the fact that her hair and eye brows were shaven at the time of examination. The injuries are sequel to the assault history given by the victim.

7. The accused had been arrested on 11.02.2012 and interviewed under caution. 

8. Foregoing Summary of Facts was read over, explained and having understood the same, the accused admitted it. The Court convict the accused for each count as charged.

9. Section 213 (1) has a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment. According to the Penal Code, Chapter 17, the offence of 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm' under Sections 245 attracts a maximum sentence is 05 years imprisonment. The present offence even though brought under Section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009 is similar.

10. The Tariff for 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm' under Section 245 of the Penal Code (now repealed), varies from a suspended sentence to 09 months imprisonment. (per Goundar J in Jonethani Sereka v State [2008]HAA 027/08S, 25 APR 2008) 

11. In view of the foregoing, I select 06 months imprisonment as the starting point for each count.

AGGRAVATING FACTORS

12. The accused has committed the offence on his wife. She was 24 years. The vulnerability of the victim due to the domestic relationship is indeed an aggravating factor for both counts.

13. In the circumstance, I increase the sentence by another 03 months.

14. Period of imprisonment now stands at 09 months for each count.

MITIGATING FACTORS

15. The grounds of mitigation are as follows: the accused is 34 years old; remorseful; apologised to the victim; both parties are now living together; sought court's leniency; promised not to re offend.

16. I have carefully considered the summary of facts and factors rendered in mitigation and early guilty plea for the charges, a reduction of 03months is given to reflect the same. 

17. The accused admitted three previous convictions that were recorded in 2000 and 2005. Hence the accused is not entitled to a deduction that is given to an accused person with previous good behaviour. 

18. The final term of imprisonment now stands at 06 months for each count.

19. In terms of Section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 a sentence below two years could be suspended, and applying the same principle, I suspend each sentence of 06 months imprisonment for 24 months in view of the promise the accused have made to this Court. 

20. If the accused commits any crime and if found guilty by a Court of law, whilst serving the suspended sentence period of 24 months, the accused will be imprisoned for a term of 12 months in terms of Section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. 

21. Further a domestic violence restraining order is in place against you with non molestation condition as per section 24(1)(b)(1) of the Domestic Violence Decree 2009 to ensure wellbeing of the victim. 
22. Section 26 (3)(a)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, has been complied with, in delivering this sentence.

23. Twenty eight (28) days to appeal.

69,797,249149,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] On the 7th August, 2015, the Accused was found guilty after trial and was convicted by this Court of one representative count of penile Rape of a 17 year girl. The Accused now comes before this Court for sentence on conviction.
 
 
[2] The facts of the case were that:
 
 
The victim of this case was 17 years of age at the time of the incident. After a dispute with her mother she decides to leave home. Having contacted a friend, she leaves for Tavua on the 20th of October. She could not find Meli in Tavua. She meets Seruwaia who was known to her. In search of Meli she goes to a church in Yasiyasi with Seruwaia but never meets Meli. Seruwaia introduces the victim to the Accused and they get acquainted with each other. 
 
 
She goes to Seruwaia's friend, Alumita's place. Accused comes there in night and attempts to talk to her. She smells liquor on him and is reluctant to talk. Accused forcibly gets hold of her, grabs her hands and takes her to a nearby house. In the kitchen of the house, Accused puts her down, undresses her and inserts his penis into her vagina. He does it twice without her consent. He leaves her thereafter. Police comes and takes her to a hospital where she is medically examined in a distressed condition. Doctor finds fresh lacerations on upper vaginal wall, multiple bruises around the neck, extra ordinarily pulling of large amount of blood in vagina.
 
 
[3] The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment. It is now well settled, and confirmed by the Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj CAV003.2014 that the tariff for rape of a juvenile is 10-15 years of imprisonment.
 
 
[4] The accused at the time of the rape was 18 years, an adult in law and the victim was only 17, a juvenile. 
 
 
Mitigating Factors 
 
 
[5] In a comprehensive written submission, Counsel for the Accused submits that the Accused is married and he is a father of three year old son. He is presently working as a security officer and supports his siblings and his parents on his salary. He was in New Zealand on a rugby scholarship and has returned to Fiji upon completion of the scholarship. He has plans to migrate to New Zealand to provide his family a better future. 
 
 
[6] In the sentencing hearing, Deacon of the Methodist Church at Tavua, Mr. Ratuovini Bokini was called by the Accused to substantiate facts his Counsel had submitted already to this Court. The Deacon said that the Accused was closely associated with the church and looking after not only his family but the extended family and neighbours as well. He further said he had noticed a change in Accused's way of life for better after his marriage and becoming a father. 
 
 
[7] According to the Accused's marriage certificate and his child's birth certificate tendered to Court, Accused has committed this offence after his marriage and when his child was only three months old. He has engaged himself in an extra marital sexual conduct for which he is now convicted as a husband and a father, against the teachings of the church. I am unable to agree with the Deacon. 
 
 
[8] Three year old son will now be looked after by his domestic worker wife. Long prison sentence of his father will undoubtedly be detrimental to child's upbringing.
 
 
[9] The Accused is the first offender and has a clear record hitherto and is young. He has co-operated during Police investigations.
 
 
Aggravating Factors 
 
 
[10] The Accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge and maintained that position right throughout the trial. By doing so, he has not saved the young girl from giving evidence and reliving the ordeal. He has thereby not shown remorse and repentance.
 
 
[11] The Accused knew of victim's vulnerability as a running away girl from home and also her vulnerability as a stranger in Tavua. Victim was a juvenile at the time of the rape. He exploited her vulnerability to satisfy his lustful desires even though he was a married man with a baby at the time of the incident. 
 
 
[12] In view of Accused's personal circumstances and his prospects of bright future as a young rugger player and also his three year old son's wellbeing, I considered, before proceeding to sentence, the following authorities cited by the Defence Counsel in mitigation. 
 
 
[13] In Moses Nariva v the State (2006) FJHC;HAA 0148J 2005, the accused was a young offender of 17 years old, juvenile. He was a first offender who pleaded guilty without wasting time of court and was remorseful. Madam Justice Shameem stated; 
 
 
""the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment''
 
 
 [14] In State v Nayate Vatu (2015) FJHC 263; HAC 231.2011 (23 April 2015) Justice Madigan sentenced a 21 year old for seven years of imprisonment for two counts of juvenile rape with non-parole period of five years. In rationalizing his finding Justice Madigan stated;
 
 
"".....It appears to be extremely important in this case that a balance be struck between expectations of the community that such activity be punished and retribution be afforded the victim with the need to recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood. Whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him (her) when faced with a serious crime or crimes, a Court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to follow the same course of action....""
 
 
[15] In his concluding remarks Justice Madigan said; 
 
 
""... I am aware that this final sentence of seven years is below the tariff for rape of a child and it is in no way meant to distort the tariff already recognized by the Supreme Court. It is a lenient sentence in recognition of the youth of the accused and his remorseful plea of guilty saving the child from giving evidence.
 
 
[16] In State v Seniqai (2011) FJHC 375; HAC 010.2011 (8th July 2011) Justice Gounder sentenced a 18 year old rape accused for 5 years of imprisonment, below tariff. Justice Gounder imposing imprisonment without fixing a non- parole said;
 
 
""...You are 18 years old. Unfortunately, you are unemployed without any meaningful purpose in life. You left school after completing Form 4. The International Convention on the Rights of a Child applies to you because of your age. I bear in mind that a prison sentence should be the last resort for a child.
 
 
 ....I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment. The purpose of your sentence is to denounce your offence and to deter you and others from committing this type of offence. Due to your youth I do not fix a non-parole period...""
 
 
[17] There have been instances where Judges of the High Court have deviated from existing tariff when they find that the sentencing within tariff either disproportionately excessive or unjust in all the circumstances of the case. 
 
 
[18] There is no victim impact assessment report before me filed by the State. Victim is now married.
 
 
Sentence
 
 
[19] Having considered all the aspects, now I proceed to sentence the Accused as follows;
 
 
[20] To reflect the gravity of offending, not the offender, I take a starting point of 10 years at the bottom of the tariff for this offence. To reflect the aggravating features of lack of remorse and exploitation of vulnerability of a young juvenile, I add three years to that starting point. In recognition of his strong mitigation of clean record, time he spent in remand, his personal circumstances and his duty to family, I deduct those three years bringing the interim sentence back to ten years. For his youth and his prospects as a rugger player trained in New Zealand on a Scholarship I deduct a further two years, bringing his sentence down to one of eight years. 
 
 
[21] Having considered the Accused's future prospects and desire for rehabilitation, I order that he serve only five years before he is eligible for parole. 
 
 
[22] I concur with the reasoning given by Justice Madigan in State v Nayate Vatu in my selecting a sentence under Tariff. I also considered the age of the victim in sentencing the Accused under tariff. 
 
 
Summary
 
 
Accused is convicted for eight years imprisonment. He will serve a minimum of five (5) years before being eligible for parole.

[1] Vineeta Devi, as per the Consolidated Information filed, you were charged, along with the 2nd accused, with the following offences:
 
 
COUNT ONE
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
ABORTION: Contrary to Section 234 (1) and (4) (a) (b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
VINEETA DEVI, between the 20th day of July 2016 to the 23rd day of July 2016, at Nausori in the Eastern Division, unlawfully performed an abortion on PAYAL PRITIKA DEVI. 
 
 
COUNT TWO
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
ABORTION: Contrary to Section 234 (1) and (4) (b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ASHISH PRASAD, between the 20th day of July 2016 to the 23rd day of July 2016, at Nausori in the Central Division, committed certain acts with intent to procure the abortion of PAYAL PRITIKA DEVI.
 
 
[2] This matter was first called before the High Court on 12 August 2016. On 2 September 2016, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) filed Information and Disclosures, relevant to the case. Subsequently, on 13 February 2017, the State filed Consolidated Information and Disclosures, as referred to above.
 
[3] When this matter was called before me on 14 May 2018, you pleaded guilty to Count One in the Consolidated Information. Court was satisfied that you fully understood the nature of the charge against you and the consequences of your plea. Court found that you pleaded guilty on your own free will and free from any influence. 
 
[4] Thereafter, the State filed the Summary of Facts on 19 June 2018. The Summary of Facts were read out and explained to you and you agreed to the same. Accordingly, Court found your guilty plea to be unequivocal. I found that the facts support all elements of Count One in the Consolidated Information, and found the said Count proved on the Summary of Facts agreed by you. Accordingly, I found you guilty on your own plea and convicted you of Count One as charged.
 
[5] I now proceed to sentence you.
 
[6] The Summary of Facts filed by the State was that:
 
“On the 20th day of July 2016, the victim Payal Pritika Devi, 22 years old, Domestic Duties of Naiyalayala, Taveuni went to Sawani with Saleshni Wati, 36 years old, Domestic Duties of Naduru, Nausori and met the first accused Vineeta Devi, 56 years old, Domestic Duties of Samron Farm Road, Nausori at her house. The victim was one month pregnant at that particular time.
 
 
The first accused then took the victim into one of the rooms of her house at Sawani. The first accused told the victim to lie on the bed and take off her panty. When the victim took off her panty, the first accused then massaged the stomach of the victim in a forceful manner that was painful to the victim.
 
 
Moreover, after massaging the victim’s stomach, the first accused brought about five sharpened cassava sticks and told the victim to spread her legs. When the victim spread her legs, the first accused then forcefully inserted the five cassava sticks individually inside the vagina of the victim. The procedure was very painful to the victim. The victim noticed that blood was coming out of her private part.
 
 
After the procedure was carried out, the victim was shocked and called her parents about what was done to her. The victim was later picked up by her parents from Sawani Bus Stop. The victim was then admitted at CWM Hospital on the 23rd of July 2016. According to the medical report of the victim (attached), she was noted to be pregnant but it was also found that she had a miscarriage. The matter was then reported to Police.
 
 
The first accused was arrested on 29th July 2016 and Caution Interviewed at Nausori Police Station on the same day. The first accused was charged for unlawfully performing an Abortion on the victim contrary Section 234 (1) of the Crimes Act 2009, on 30th July 2016, at Nausori Police Station. The first accused admitted in question numbers 37 to 39 of her Caution Interview (attached) that she had inserted five cassava sticks into the vagina of the victim in order to abort the victim’s baby.
 
 
Furthermore, the first accused is not a medically qualified practitioner or a certified midwife. The first accused also knew that what she had done to the victim to abort the victim’s baby was unlawful and wrong. The first accused admitted this in her answer to question number 65 of her Caution Interview.
 
 
Moreover, in her answer to question 89 of her Caution Interview, the first accused admitted that she heard another telling the victim that if she does this abortion, then his first wife will sign on the property papers. Moreover, the first accused admitted in her answer to question 27 that another will give her $200.00 to massage the victim’s stomach since they do not want the baby. Moreover, the first accused further admitted in her answer to question 29 that she was not that smart but she was told by another just to massage so that the victim will have a miscarriage.” 
 
 
[7] Vineeta Devi you have admitted to the above Summary of Facts and taken full responsibility for your actions. 
 
[8] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act No. 42 of 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”) stipulates the relevant factors that a Court should take into account during the sentencing process. I have duly considered these factors in determining the sentence to be imposed on you. 
 
[9] In terms of Section 234 (1) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009 (Crimes Act), “A person commits an indictable offence if he or she unlawfully performs an abortion”. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
 
[10] Sections 234 (2), (3) and (4) are re-produced below:
 
(2) The performance of an abortion by a medical practitioner is not unlawful for the purposes of this section if — 
 
(a) the abortion is performed by a medical practitioner in good faith and with reasonable care and skill; and 
 
(b) the pregnancy is the result of sexual intercourse between—
 
(i) a parent and child; or
 
(ii) a brother and sister (whether of the whole blood or half-blood); or 
 
(iii) a grandparent and grandchild; or 
 
(c) the pregnancy is the result of sexual intercourse that constitutes the offence of rape under this Decree. 
 
(3) In this section— 
 
""medical practitioner"" means any person lawfully registered under a law of Fiji to practice as a medical practitioner. 
 
(4) A reference in this section to performing an abortion includes a reference to— 
 
(a) attempting to perform an abortion; and 
 
(b) doing any act with intent to procure an abortion, whether or not the woman concerned is pregnant. 
 
[Emphasis is mine]. 
 
[11] There is no set or settled tariff for the offence of Abortion contrary to Section 234 of the Crimes Act.
 
[12] The Court of Appeal in Devi v. State [1992] 38 FLR 94 (3 June 1992); held:
 
 The Appellant was on the 14 November 1990, sentenced to two years imprisonment on a charge of manslaughter. She had been charged with murder but that charge was reduced to manslaughter and she pleaded guilty to that charge. The crime in respect of which she was charged, was performing an illegal abortion, as a result of which the person on whom the abortion was performed lost her life. It is unnecessary to recount in detail the facts of that particular activity but we have no hesitation in stating that the sentence which was imposed by the learned trial judge was perfectly proper in all the circumstances.
 
[13] In this case, the Appellant had spent a total of 13 months in custody by the time her appeal against sentence was heard. Considering all the circumstances of the case the Court adjudged her to have been sufficiently punished and varied the sentence to allow her release. 
 
[14] In the case of State v. Mudaliar [2006] FJHC 47; HAC 15.2005S (17 May 2006); His Lordship Justice A.H.C.T. Gates (as he then was) ordered a sentence of 3 years imprisonment for a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist who carried out an abortion which led to the death of a 20 year old USP undergraduate. 
 
[15] In this case, His Lordship Gates made the following observations:
 
[1] The Accused has been found guilty after trial of one count of manslaughter contrary to sections 198 and 201 of the Penal Code. The maximum term of imprisonment provided by the Code for such an offence is one of life.
 
[2] A 20 year old USP undergraduate consulted the Accused, who is a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist in private practice, seeking an abortion. The Accused agreed to do it and charged $950.
 
[3] The student was already 20 weeks into her term of pregnancy. At that term the procedure for abortion presents a greater risk than for a person who is 13 weeks or less into her pregnancy.
 
[4] Unfortunately the operation performed in the Accused’s surgery was not performed successfully. In the process the uterus was torn. This injury damaged the blood supply and led to massive bleeding. The bleeding caused shock from which the patient died.
 
[5] The first basis to be considered for the sentence is that an unlawful act had been carried out on the patient, namely the abortion, which act was a serious offence in itself. The patient’s life was not in danger prior to the abortion. This was not a case where such a medical procedure was necessary or justified. Nor did the Accused maintain that it was. He denied having carried out such an act.
 
[6] The second basis for sentence is the allegation of gross negligence in not treating his patient, once she was seriously ill and in peril, with sufficient regard for her health and safety. This comprised the failure to remove her to the intensive care unit at the CWM Hospital, the abandonment of her unattended in the locked surgery overnight whilst in this state, and the unprofessional manner in which she was handled. This included the complete absence of history, notes, and records, which would be required by a receiving hospital upon emergency removal. 
 
[16] However, this conviction and sentence was later set aside by the Supreme Court and a re-trial was ordered.
 
 [17] In State v. Sivoinatoto [2014] FJHC 208; HAC207.2011 (27 March 2014); His Lordship Justice Sudharshana De Silva sentenced the accused to 2 years imprisonment consequent to him pleading guilty to the offence of Abortion contrary to Section 234 (1) and 4 (b) of the Crimes Act.
[18] The brief summary of facts of the said case are as follows:
 
Sometimes in March 2011, the complainant (MN) was not having her mensus. At the time, she was staying with the accused (Mr Oteti Sivoinatoto) at Bandila Crescent, Rifle Range in Lautoka. The complainant then told the accused (Mr Oteti Sivoinatoto) sometimes in April 2011 and August 2011 that her mensus were not coming and she thought that she was pregnant. The accused then gave the complainant rum which was mixed with milk for the complainant to drink to abort the baby. The complainant drank and nothing happened.
 
On the following day, the complainant after returning from school, the accused mixed her a strong tea to drink to abort the baby but it was again unsuccessful. On another occasion sometimes in April 2011 and August 2011, the accused gave the complainant two (2) raw eggs to drink to abort the baby.
 
The matter was reported to the Police and he was charged for Abortion contrary to Section 234 (1) (4) (b) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The accused was then cautioned interviewed by the Police and he admits to giving various things to the complainant to drink in order to abort the baby, but those attempts failed.
 
[19] Section 6 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act provides the circumstances under which Guideline Judgments may be issued by Courts. The Section reads as follows:
 
(1) On hearing and considering an appeal against sentence the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court may, on its own initiative or on an application made by a party to the appeal, consider whether to give a guideline judgment, or to review a guideline judgment that has already been given.
 
(2) A guideline judgment given by the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court shall be taken into account and applied by the High Court and the Magistrates Court when considering cases to which the guideline judgment applies. 
 
(3) On hearing an appeal from a sentence given by a Magistrate, a judge of the High Court may, on its own initiative or on an application made by a party to the appeal, consider whether to give a guideline judgment, or to review a guideline judgment that has already been made under this sub-section. 
 
(4) A guideline judgment given under sub-section (3) shall be taken into account by all Magistrates when sentencing offenders for offences to which the guideline judgment applies. 
 
 [20] Therefore, although there is no set tariff for the offence of Abortion contrary to Section 234 of the Crimes Act, this is not an appropriate case for this Court to issue a guideline judgment or to set a tariff for the offence of Abortion.
[21] Vineeta Devi, the offence you have been found guilty and convicted for is a serious offence. You are not a medically qualified practitioner nor a certified mid-wife. However, you had illegally carried out an abortion on the complainant in this case, Payal Pritikia Devi, who was 22 years of age and one month pregnant at the time. 
 
[22] When the complainant was brought before you, you had asked her to take off her panty and then massaged her stomach in a forceful manner that was painful to her. After massaging the complainant’s stomach, you had brought about five sharpened cassava sticks and told her to spread her legs. When the complainant spread her legs, you then forcefully inserted the five cassava sticks individually inside her vagina. The procedure was very painful and the complainant had noticed that blood was coming out of her private part. Later the complainant was hospitalized at the CWM Hospital and had a miscarriage. 
 
 [23] In mitigation you have submitted as follows: 
 
(i) That you are a first offender and that you have no previous convictions to date. The State too confirms that there are no previous convictions recorded against you.
 
(ii) That you fully cooperated with the Police when you were taken in for questioning and subsequently charged instead of trying to circumvent the course of justice. 
 
 (iii) You have sought forgiveness from this Court and have assured that you will not re-offend. You have submitted that you are truly remorseful of your actions. 
 
 (iv) That you entered a guilty plea at an early stage of these proceedings. 
 
[24] Taking into consideration all factors of this case, including the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence (14 years imprisonment), the nature and gravity of the offence, your culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence, the impact of the offence on the complainant, and the mitigating factors stated above, I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment for Count One. 
 
[25] I accept that you entered a guilty plea at an early stage of these proceedings. In doing so, you saved precious time and resources of this Court. For your early guilty plea I grant you a discount of 2 years from your sentence. Accordingly, your sentence will be 3 years imprisonment.
 
[26] The next issue for consideration is whether your sentence should be suspended.
 
 
[27] Section 26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act provides as follows:
 
(1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances. 
 
(2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence,— 
 
(a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or 
 
(b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrate’s Court. 
 
[28] Vineeta Devi, you are now 58 years of age and living in Sawani in Nausori. You are said to be self- employed selling roti parcels, earning approximately $70.00 weekly. You are married and have adopted a son, who is schooling in primary school. You are said to be a heart patient and suffering from short breadth. You are said to be a person of good character and a well-respected person in the community.
 
[29] You have admitted that what you did was wrong, and taken full responsibility for your actions. You are a person of previous good character. You have sought forgiveness from this Court and have assured that you will not re-offend. You have submitted that you are truly remorseful of your actions. You have also promised that you would lead a crime free life if you are granted a non-custodial punishment. 
 
[30] In Singh & Others v. State [2000] FJHC 115; HAA 79J of 2000S (26 October 2000); Her Ladyship Madam Justice Shameem held: 
 
 “....However, as a general rule, leniency is shown to first offenders, young offenders, and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse.....”
 
[31] Considering all the facts and circumstances of this case, I deem it appropriate to suspend your sentence. However, to deter other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature, and also to protect the community, I suspend your sentence for a period of 5 years. 
 
[32] In the result, your final sentence would be 3 years imprisonment, which term of imprisonment is suspended for a period of 5 years. 
 
[33] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal if you so wish.

Sixth Count
Statement of Offence 

RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) and section 207 (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

WAISEA RAMASIMA on the 8th day of October 2011 at Vuci Road, Nausori in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of E.V. without her consent.

	1.	It was revealed at the trial that Ms. E.V., the victim had been sexually abused by you somewhere between April 2011 to 8th of October 2011 for six times. She had surrendered to your authority as her uncle and the guardian who meets her expenses for living and education. You had told her several times that you will simply abandon her in case she divulges her sexual activities with you to anybody. Ms. E.V. had got pregnant as a result of her sexual relationship with you and given birth to a baby at the time she offered evidence in court. This court in its judgment, overturned the unanimous opinion of the assessors and found you 'guilty' as the 'submission' of Ms. E.V. to your 'demands' cannot be considered as 'free and voluntary consent' to have sexual intercourse.

	2.	The maximum sentence for 'Rape' under the Crimes Decree, as well as the Penal Code, is life imprisonment. For a rape on an adult person, the tariff ranges from 7 to 15 years imprisonment. (see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0021j.93S (1994) (FJCA 25, (27 May 1994); Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal Case No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Case Appeal Case No. AAU 0025 of 2003, The State v Bijendra Criminal Case No. HAC 127 of 2011).

	3.	Having considered the existing circumstances, I take a starting point of 8 years imprisonment to proceed with your sentence for each count.

	4.	There is no doubt that you breached the all-important guardianship trust towards Ms. E.V. You were supposed to look after her and guide her to have a good education as her uncle. She had come to Viti Levu with the high expectations of securing a better future with a sound education. Your opportunistic actions had only resulted her becoming a young single mother. You had completely robbed the youth of your niece systematically within several months. Now she is left alone with a devastated future and a lifelong trauma. For these aggravating factors, I add 4 years imprisonment to the starting point.

	5.	In mitigation, you claimed that you are 49 years of age and married with 4 children, the oldest being 16 years and youngest is 11 years old. You are the sole breadwinner of the family. Now you are unemployed.

	6.	Pastor Manasa Bainivatu of Pentecost Church was called by you to offer character evidence before the sentencing. The Pastor said that he is been knowing you since 2009 and said that you were burdened a lot after this incident. He reminded that even the people who serve god might falter, but will rise again. He raised his concerns about the church expansion programme, as it would be difficult without a good carpenter like you.

	7.	Mrs. Ramasima, your wife also testified in sentencing hearing and confirmed the difficulties, mainly financial, that they are facing in your absence. She said that she had forgiven you and accepted back to the family.

	8.	Most importantly you are a first offender with a clear criminal record. After having considered all these mitigating factors, I will deduct 2 years from your interim sentence. 

	9.	Your final sentence now stands as 10 years imprisonment for each count.

	10.	Having due regard to the 'totality principle' in sentencing, I order the 10 years imprisonment of each count to run concurrently. 

	11.	You have been in remand custody for 5 weeks, since the Judgment was pronounced. In terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, that 5 weeks is ordered to be reduced from your final sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Now, it is 9 years, 10 months and 3 weeks.

	12.	As a final note, I must say that this court does endorse the Pastor's comment that people do mistakes or faults, but they be given another chance for life. But, I still recall you telling the court that you will still be continuing your sexual relationship with Ms. E.V., had she not got pregnant. Your attitude with nihilism is unpardonable. A 49 year old married man with four grown up children, when engaged with a girl who is almost in the same age of his elder daughter, would have thought more responsibly about the repercussions his family has to face over his conduct. Thus, you will receive an immediate custodial sentence with a non-parole period of 7 years.

72,800,241315,"JUDGMENT 
 
 
Gamalath, JA
 
 
[1] I have read in draft the judgment of Prematilaka, JA and I am in agreement with his reasoning and the conclusions.
 
 
Prematilaka, JA
 
 
[2] This appeal arises from the conviction of the Appellant on two counts of rape under the Crimes Decree, 2009 (now the Crimes Act, 2009). All offences are alleged to have been committed at Tagitagi, Sigatoka in the Western Division against P (name withheld). 
 
 
[3] The first count of rape is under section 207 (2) (a) for having had carnal knowledge of P without her consent between 01 April 2011 and 30 April 2011 and the second count of rape is under section 207 (2) (a) for having had carnal knowledge of P without her consent on 27 July 2011.
 
 
[4] After trial the assessors expressed unanimous opinions that the Appellant was guilty of all counts. The Learned High Court Judge concurred with their opinion and convicted the Appellant in his Judgment on 20 March 2014. On 01 April 2014, the Learned Judge imposed sentences of 12 years and 09 months of imprisonment on both counts to run concurrently with a non-parole period 12 years of imprisonment (i.e. the mandatory period to be served before the Appellant becomes eligible for parole) to run from the date of the judgment. 
 
 
 Preliminary observations
 
 
[5] The Appellant had sought leave to appeal, belatedly though, against the conviction on three grounds of appeal and on two grounds of appeal against the sentence. The single Judge of the Court of Appeal had granted enlargement of time and seems to have granted leave to appeal on 15 July 2016 in respect all grounds of appeal except the first ground of appeal against the sentence. The Legal Aid Commission appearing on behalf of the Appellant indicated at the hearing of the appeal that it would rely on the written submissions filed at the leave stage. The State had addressed all the grounds of appeal in its fresh written submissions as well as in the written submissions filed previously. 
 
 
Grounds of Appeal 
 
 
[6] Therefore, the grounds of appeal that would be considered by this Court are as follows. 
 The grounds of appeal against the conviction are as follows.
 
 
Ground 1
 
 
‘The learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors that evidence of recent complaint is not evidence of the facts complained of and cannot be regarded as corroboration but goes to the consistency of the conduct of the complainant with her evidence given at trial.’
 


 
Ground 2
 
 
‘The learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he directed the assessors that believing the doctor’s evidence meant there was corroboration of sexual intercourse when she had not examined the victim.’
 
 
Ground 3
 
 
‘The Appellant was prejudiced due to lack of legal representation.’
 
 
The grounds of appeal against the sentence are
 
 
Ground 4
 
 
‘The learned trial Judge erred in principle and also erred in exercising his sentencing discretion to the extent:
  
• That he did not give enough discount for the Appellant’s mitigating factors;
 
• That the non-parole period is too close to the head sentence resulting in much more severe punishment.’
 

 Summary of evidence
 
 
[7] The victim had been 13 years old at the time of the incident. The Appellant is her step farther and the victim had been living with him and her mother in April 2011 at Sigatoka. On the day of the first incident the victim had been babysitting at home while the Appellant also had been at home complaining of a headache. At about 2.30 p.m. the Appellant had come near her and asked how she was and she had replied in the affirmative. He had then pushed her onto the bed, removed her clothes and taken his clothes off partially and inserted his penis into her vagina. At the time of the act, the Appellant had covered her mouth with his hand and she had been unable to shout. After 10-15 minutes the Appellant had left after threatening her that he would kill her if she were to tell anyone. Though her mother had returned home by 3.30 p.m. the victim had not told her of what had happened as she was frightened. 
 
 
[8] On 27 July 2011 the victim had been at home at Rakiraki babysitting at about 2.00 p.m. when the Appellant had asked her to bring him a cup of tea. When she brought tea the Appellant had pushed her onto the bed, removed her clothes and partially his clothes and penetrated her vagina with his penis. The Appellant had covered her mouth with his hand. This episode had lasted for 15-20 minutes and thereafter the Appellant had gone to the garden. The victim’s mother and the Appellant’s parents had been away in the garden at the time of the incident and returned at about 5.00 p.m. but the victim had not complained to them as the Appellant had threatened to kill her if she would divulge it to anyone. On the following day i.e. 28 July 2011the victim had proceeded to the police station and met witness Vicky on the way. She had told Vicky that her stepfather had raped her and he had taken her in his vehicle to Nalawa police station. She had been taken to hospital on the same day by the police where she had been medically examined. 
 
 
[9] The victim had been emphatic in her evidence that there was no consent on her part to both acts of sexual intercourse. The Appellant had cross-examined the victim briefly and suggested that her grandparents had wanted the victim to implicate him and the victim was lying. However, two of the questions and answers put to the victim are worth being quoted.
 
 
 ‘Q: Can you tell when I raped you which brother was beaten and was asked to go out? Yes, my brother Rishant Chand, this was in Sigatoka.
 
 
 
 Q: Did you take your clothes on your own and came to my room and I chased you away? No.’
 
 
[10] Vicky Eliyaz Rafiq had testified to the fact that around 9.00 p.m. on 28 July 2011 while he was on a routine field trip, he had seen a girl of Indian origin running towards the main road and stopped his vehicle and talked to her. Her body language had suggested that she was angry and scared. She had told him that one Rohit Prasad, her step father had raped her on 27 July 2011and wanted a medical examination done. Vicky had taken her in his vehicle to Nalawa police station and told the police officer there as to what the victim had told him. Vicky had not been cross-examined by the appellant who had defended himself at the trial. 
 
 
[11] Dr.Alunita had produced the Medical Examination Form (MEF) of the victim handwritten and signed by Dr. Helan who had gone abroad for employment at the time of the trial. The witness had worked with Dr. Helan for 03 years and could identify the latter’s handwriting. According to the MEF, the victim had been examined on 28 July 2011 around 3.30 p.m. at Rakiraki Hospital. There had been no bruises on the body and her hymen had not been intact indicting loss of virginity. No laceration on the vaginal wall or bleeding in the vagina had been observed. Dr. Helan had opined that the victim’s was not the first time sexual contact case. Dr. Alunita had said that the impaired hymen could have been caused by penetration of any object or vigorous physical activity such as athletics and the second sexual intercourse could have taken place without leaving any injuries. Under cross-examination the witness had said that the examining doctor had not determined as to when the victim had been raped for the first time. 
 
 
[12] The Appellant had elected to give evidence and in his evidence had said that he had been framed by the victim’s grandparents. He seems to say that in the first instance he was away from home attending to harvesting while the rest of the family was at home. But he says that he came back and he had a headache and stayed at home till afternoon. 
 
 
 
[13] His position regarding the second incident is that he had asked for a cup of tea from the victim while sleeping in his room and when he got up he had gone to the farm with his mother who had been in a neighbour’s house at the relevant time and returned home. He had helped his wife in planting seeds of cabbage at the farm. All of them had returned home and had dinner together. His father had played music and the victim and her sister had danced where the Appellant had watched and teased them. In the morning of the following day the victim had told her mother that the Appellant had raped her and the mother (Appellant’s wife) had confronted him with the said allegation. Then the Appellant had confronted the victim and asked why she had made such a serious allegation and she had replied that he had raped her. Then the appellant had asked her to go and complain to the police. 
 
 
[14] Under cross-examination, the Appellant had admitted that during both incidents the victim and the Appellant were at home and the victim’s mother was away at the farm or garden which was around the house.
 
 
[15] Considering the totality of her evidence, Sushila Wati, the Appellant’s mother seems to say that the Appellant had been at home without them during a certain period of time after 3.00 p.m. after coming back from the farm. The witness was not sure of any dates. She had admitted that she loved her son and would do anything to protect and save him. The Appellant’s father, Narendra also seems to say that on 27 July 2011 he left home to go the farm at 3.00 p.m. and the Appellant was at home. He too had said tha he loved her son and would do anything to protect him. 
 
 
[16] Neither party had sought re-directions at the end of the case though specifically requested by the Learned Trial Judge. 
 
 
[17] I would now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal. 
 
 
 
Ground 1
 
 
 ‘The learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors that evidence of recent complaint is not evidence of the facts complained of and cannot be regarded as corroboration but goes to the consistency of the conduct of the complainant with her evidence given at trial.’
 
 
[18] The relevant paragraphs in the summing up are as follows:
 
 
 ‘The next witness for the prosecution was Vicky EliyazRafiq. He was on his routine trip to field on 28.7.2011 around 9.00 a.m. with his attendant in his vehicle. At Barotu he had seen an Indian girl wearing a Pink top and Black skirt running towards the main road. As the girl looked scared he had talked to her. This girl was not known to him earlier. She told him that she was raped by her step father Rohit Prasad and she wants her medical done. Thus he had taken this girl to the police station in his vehicle. Accused did not cross examine this witness.’
 
 ‘This is an independent witness. He corroborates the version of the complainant. If you believe this witness's evidence beyond reasonable doubt there is evidence of recent complaint in respect of the last incident on 27.7.2011.’
[19] It is clear that the Learned High Court Judge had referred to Vicky’s evidence as to what the victim had told him as evidence of recent complaint but the Judge had also said that his evidence corroborates the victim’s version. It is well settled by many a authority that evidence of recent complaint can never be capable of corroborating the complainant’s version and at most it is relevant to the issue of consistency or otherwise of the complainant’s conduct vis-à-vis her credibility and reliability as a witness (see Raj v. State CAV0003 of 2014:20 August 2014 [2014] FJSC 12). 
[20] However, this aspect of the summing up had not been brought to the attention of the Learned High Court Judge by either party for a re-direction. I could understand the failure on the part of the Appellant who appeared in person but cannot fathom the silence observed by the prosecutor who, in my view, was performing a quasi-judicial function and had a duty to point this error out to the Trial Judge without allowing a ground of appeal to be raised on this error in the directions. Needless to say that when such grounds of appeal are raised a considerable time of the appellate court has to be spent in dealing with them which the appellate court could otherwise devote to the real issues involved in the culpability or otherwise of an appellant. 
[21] The appellate courts have from time and again frowned upon the failure of the defense counsel in not raising appropriate directions with the trial judge and said that if not, the appellate court would not look at the complaints against the summing-up in appeal based on such misdirections or non-directions favorably. The appellate courts would be slow to entertain such a ground of appeal. The Supreme Court said in Rajthat raising of matters of appropriate directions with the trial judge is a useful function and by doing so counsel would not only act in their client’s interest but also they would help in achieving a fair trial and once again reiterated this position inTuwai v StateCAV0013 of 2015: 26 August 2016[2016] FJSC 35 and in Alfaaz v StateCAV0009 of 2018: 30 August 2018[2018] FJSC 17. 
[22] However, in my view, when the Appellant has appeared in person reasonable allowance should be accorded for such a failure on his or her part to raise appropriate directions with trial judge to ensure a fair hearing at the hearing of the appeal. I also think that when the appellant has not been defended by a qualified and trained pleader, it is more incumbent upon the prosecuting counsel to be alert and vigilant and point out such misdirections or non-directions to the trial judge not only to ensure a fair trial but also to relieve the appellate courts of the avoidable burden of having to spend valuable time in appeal in considering such alleged errors in the summing up. 
[23] In terms of section 129 of the Crimes Decree 2009 (now Crimes Act 2009) no corroboration of the complainant’s evidence, irrespective of the age, is necessary for the accused to be convicted and no warning to the assessors is also required to be given relating to the absence of corroboration. A large body of judicial decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court has unequivocally affirmed this position. Therefore, the direction to the assessors that Vicky’s evidence corroborates the complainant’s version would have had little negative impact on the Appellant as the Trial Judge had also directed that corroboration is to have some independent evidence to support the victim’s story and there is no rule for the assessors to look for corroboration of the victim’s story to bring home a verdict of guilty in a rape case and the case stands or falls on her testimony. Thus, the assessors may not have treated Vicky’s evidence as corroborative of the complainant’s version as the source of that evidence as to who raped her came from the complainant herself. 
 [24] Therefore, while I am of the opinion that there is merit in the point with the impugned direction of the learned High Court Judge raised under the first ground of appeal and that it should be decided in favour of the appellant, I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred and therefore I proceed to apply the proviso to section Section 23 of the Court of Appeal Actand reject the appeal on that ground. 
 Ground 2
 ‘The learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he directed the assessors that believing the doctor’s evidence meantthere was corroboration of sexual intercourse when she had not examined the victim.’
[25] The impugned paragraph in the summing up is as follows:
 ‘The doctor is an independent witness. If you believe her evidence thereis corroboration on sexual intercourse. However, there are no injuries. The doctor is not the person who examined the victim. She was giving evidence on a report prepared by another doctor. Before attaching any weight to this evidence you have to keep these factors in mind
 
[26] In the first place the Medical Examination Form had been admitted in evidence without any objection or challenge to its authenticity. Secondly, Dr. Alunitahad recognized the handwriting and signature of Dr.Helan who had examined the complainant on 28 July 2011 and prepared the MEF. Dr. Alunita’s ability to give evidence on the MEF prepared by Dr. Helan too had not been challenged. Her evidence which had been mostly based on the MEF had not been discredited either. In the circumstances, I think the direction quoted above has no blemish to complaint about. It is a very fair direction. 
[27] The Learned Judge was right when he had told the assessors that if they could believe the doctor’s evidence there is corroboration of sexual intercourse as the examination had revealed an impaired (non-intact) hymen and the complainant had been identified as having had sexual intercourse before, for she had already lost virginity. Lack of fresh injuries could be explained by the non-resistance on the part of the complainant and Dr.Alunita had said that the second sexual intercourse could have taken place without injuries. Thus, the medical evidence certainly provides corroboration on sexual intercourse as spoken to by the complainant. 
[28] The Appellant also complains that the Learned Judge’s above direction was wrong as the medical evidence had revealed that loss of virginity could also take place due to many reasons other than penetration by a blunt object. However, there was no evidence at all that the complainant had indulged in any vigorous physical activity such as athletics that could have accounted for the loss of virginity and therefore, the Trial Judge was not required to direct the assessors on such a hypothetical possibility. 
[29] Therefore, I reject the appeal on the second ground of appeal as well. 
 Ground 03
 ‘The Appellant was prejudiced due to lack of legal representation.’
[30] The case record reveals that the Appellant had first appeared in the High Court on 05August 2011 and till 30 July 2012 he had been given time by the court either to retain private counsel or to obtain legal aid. In between he had not been able to retain a private counsel and the Legal Aid Commission had rejected his request and his appeal to appear for him at the trial. On 30 July 2012 the Appellant had informed court that he would represent himself. Yet, the trial proper had commenced on 18 March 2014 where the Appellant had informed court that he was ready for the trial and appeared in person. Thus, effectively the Appellant had been granted more than 02 years and 07 months to make arrangements for legal representation.
[31] No court could wait indefinitely for an accused to find some form of legal representation without proceeding with the trail, for the court has to be mindful of the plight of the victim who is entitled to get on with his or her life as soon as possible without having to recount a very unpleasant and traumatic experience once again in the distant future and the possibility of the non-availability of witnesses with the passage of time etc. 
[32] I am not unmindful of the sentiments expressed by the High Court in Chand v State HAC138 of 2005:18 January 2008[2008] FJHC 9 to the following effect
 ‘The constitutional right to legal representation, albeit not absolute, embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average accused does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself or herself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his or her liberty. The accused’s right to legal representation is particularly important in an adversary system of criminal justice. The State hires qualified or trained lawyers to prosecute. The accused persons who have money hire best lawyers to defend. The poor accused persons are left to defend themselves. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer – to the untrained laymen – may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious’ (emphasis added)
[33] However, in Ramalasou v State AAU0085.2007:28 May 2010[2010] FJCA 19 the Court of Appeal remarked as follows
 
 ‘[9] This court has on several occasions explained the practical limits on the right to counsel. The right to counsel is not absolute. Where an accused person is indigent, the right to be provided with representation under the Legal Aid Scheme must depend on the interests of justice. Although, as this Court observed in AseselaDrotini v. The State Cr. App. AAU1/05, 24 March 2006:
 
 ""It is preferable that anyone facing a serious charge should be able to be represented by counsel. Unfortunately the limited resources of the State and the financial circumstances of many defendants mean they are unrepresented. In such circumstances the trial court should ensure that the defendant has been allowed reasonable time to instruct counsel. Once he has, the court also has a duty to hear the case as expeditiously as possible. Whenever an accused is unrepresented the court should explain the procedure sufficiently for the accused to be able to conduct his defence.
 
 The question for this Court is whether there is a possibility that he was adversely prejudiced by his lack of representation. In the present case, the record shows that he was given more than adequate time to find counsel, he was advised correctly of his rights by the trial judge and conducted his case competently."" (emphasis added)
 
 
 [34] It is clear from the case record that the Appellant had been explained the procedure in Hindi at the beginning of the trial and after the examination-in-chief of every witness the evidence had been explained and the Appellant had indicated that he had understood the evidence. At the close of the prosecution case the Learned High Court Judge had explained his rights and the options available to him and the Appellant had elected to give evidence. 
[35] Therefore, the guidelines set in Ramalasou and Drotini have been followed in this case adequately to ensure a fair trial and I am of the view that the appellant had not been substantially prejudiced by the lack of legal representation at his trialbecause on the facts of this case I do not think that the assessors properly directed on how to evaluate the recent compliant evidence would have come to a different finding. I have already decided that the second ground relating to the alleged error in the direction has no merits. I also find that the Appellant’s position that he was away from home at the time of the two incidents of rape cannot sustained and carry little credibility in the light of the two questions posed by him to the complainant (quoted above) and his own evidence virtually admitting his presence. His parents’ evidence does not carry his case any further. Thus, on the whole there is no merit in this ground of appeal.
[36] Therefore, I reject the appeal on the third ground as well.
 Ground 04 (a)
 ‘That the Learned trial judge did not give enough discount for the Appellant’s mitigating factors.’
[37] The Learned High Court Judge has taken 11 years as the starting point and added 04 years on account of aggravating factors and then having considered the Appellant’s age of 35 years and his having been the sole bread winner of a daughter aged 08 years as mitigating factors and deducted 02 years for the same and arrive at the lead sentence of 13 years. After deducting 03 months of his remand period in terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree the Trial Judge had arrived at the final sentence of 12 years and 09 months. 
[38] Kasim v State;AAU 0021 of 1993S: 27 May 1994 [1994] FJCA 25 set the starting point for sentencing an adult in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features as seven years but added that there are cases where the proper sentence could be substantially higher or lower than the starting point.Drotini v The State; AAU0001 of 2005S: 24 March 2006[2006] FJCA 26increased the starting point of cases of rape by fathers or stepfathers to 10 years with substantial increases above the starting point for aggravating factors. The Court of Appeal in Raj v State; AAU0038 of 2010: 05 March 2014[2014] FJCA 18increased the minimum sentence in rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) to 10 years and stated that the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years. The Supreme Court in Raj v State; CAV0003 of 2014:20 August 2014 [2014] FJSC 12) indorsed the Court of Appeal pronouncement and said that the tariff for rape of a child is between 10-16 years imprisonment.
 
[39] Thus, the Learned High Court Judge has correctly selected 11 years as the starting point. While the Trial Judge’s consideration of the fact that the Appellant had been a first offender cannot be faulted, the Appellant’s family circumstances should not have been considered as a mitigating factor to attract a reduction of 02 years. To that extent as said by the Court of Appeal in Raj the Appellant had been afforded leniency that he did not deserve. Therefore, there is no merit in the Appellant’s complaint of inadequacy of the reduction afforded to mitigating factors by the Trial Judge. 
[40] Therefore, I reject the appeal on ground 4(a) of the appeal ground as well.
 Ground 04(b)
 ‘That the non-parole period is too close to the head sentence resulting in much more severe punishment.’
[41] The Learned Trial Judge while sentencing the Appellant to 12 years and 09 months imprisonment had fixed the period during which he is not eligible to be released as 12 year in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. Section 18(4) states that any non-parole period so fixed must be at least 06 months less than the term of the sentence. Thus, the non-parole period of 12 years fixed by the Trial Judge is in compliance with section 18(4). 
[42] The complaint of the Appellant is that by fixing the non-parole period as 12 years the court had made the sentence imposed more severe. This argument flows from the effect of section 27(2) of the Correction Service Act, 2006 (previously known as Prisons and Corrections Act 2006) which is as follows.
 
 
 
 
‘Initial classification
 
 
 27. (1) All convicted prisoners shall be classified in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Commissioners Orders.
 

 (2) For the purposes of the initial classification a date of release for each prisoner shall be determined which shall be calculated on the basis of a remission of one-third of the sentence for any term of imprisonment exceeding one month.’
 
 
 [43] Section 28 also deals with remission as follows.
 
 ‘Remission of sentence
 
 28. (1) The remission of sentence that is applied at the initial classification shall thereafter be dependent on the good behaviour of the prisoner, and it may be forfeited and then restored, in accordance with Commissioners Orders.
 
(2) The Minister may grant further remission upon the recommendation of the Commissioner given in accordance with any criteria prescribed by Regulations or the Commissioners Orders.
 
 
 (3) Procedures for appeal against a decision to forfeit any entitlement to remission may be prescribed by Regulations or Commissioners Orders.’
 
 
[44] The argument advanced is that without the non-parole of 12 years the appellant would have been entitled to get one third remission of the head sentence from the Commissioner of Correction Centre subject to good behavior and when the parole period is only 09 months away from the head sentence the Appellant would be able to get a remission only on the balance period of 09 months which is 03 months. Thus, the Appellant will have to compulsorily serve at least 12 years and 06 months of imprisonment. Therefore, the Appellant also argues that the Trial Judge should have given reasons for fixing the non-parole period so close to the head sentence. 
[45] The Appellant relies on the decision of the court of Appeal in Tora v State AAU0063 of 2011:27 February 2015 [2015] FJCA 20 where the Court of Appeal reduced the non-parole period from 08 years (fixed by the High Court) to 06 years on the following reasoning. 
 
 ‘[2] The purpose of fixing the non-parole term is to fix the minimum term that the Appellant is required to serve before being eligible for any early release. Although there is no indication in section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 as to what matters should be considered when fixing the non-parole period, it is my view that the purposes of sentencing set out in section 4(1) should be considered with particular reference to re-habilitation on the one hand and deterrence on the other. As a result the non-parole term should not be so close to the head sentence as to deny or discourage the possibility of re-habilitation. Nor should the gap between the non-parole term and the head sentence be such as to be ineffective as a deterrent. It must also be recalled that the current practice of the Corrections Department, in the absence of a parole board, is to calculate the one third remission that a prisoner may be entitled to under section 27 (2) of the Corrections Service Act 2006 on the balance of the head sentence after the non-parole term has been served.
 
 [3] In my view the non-parole term of seven years on a head sentence of 8 years does not promote or facilitate conditions which might assist the re-habilitation of the Appellant. I note that the previous criminal history of the Appellant may lead to the conclusion that the prospect of rehabilitation is unlikely. However even a prisoner with the Appellant's record should not be deprived or denied the chance or the opportunity to re-habilitate himself or to be rehabilitated. Although relatively long as a ratio of the head sentence, a non-parole term of six years represents a balance between re-habilitation and deterrence in this case.’ (emphasis added)
 
 
[46] However, in Singh v StateAAU009 of 2013: 30 September 2016[2016] FJCA 126 without any reference to Tora or section4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009the Court of Appeal had said:
 
 ‘It is clear from section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 that the fixing of a non-parole period is at the discretion of the court and not a necessary must. In Natini v State [2015] FJCA 154: AAU102.2010 (3 December 2015) the Court of Appeal said: (emphasis added)
 
 
 “While leaving the discretion to decide on the non-parole period when sentencing to the sentencing Judge it would be necessary to state that the sentencing Judge would be in the best position in the particular case to decide on the non-parole period depending on the circumstances of the case.”
 
 And further stated that the non-parole period “was intended to be the minimum period which the offender would have to serve, so that the offender would not be released earlier than the court thought appropriate, whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission”.
 
 ‘I am also of the view that the wording in section 18(1) and 18(2) is not suggestive that the intention of the Legislature in enacting that provision had rehabilitation of offenders in mind as sought to be argued by the Appellant. Quite contrarily it is deterrence and retribution that Parliament appears to have intended.’
 ‘Further it cannot be said that fixing a non-parole period is the only manner by which conditions for promotion and facilitation of rehabilitation can be established. Rehabilitation in my view is a part of the duties of the Correction Institute and should be afforded to all inmates.’
[47] Therefore, in my view the decision in Singh has not cast any doubt on the reasoning in Tora as to the considerations that should be taken into account when fixing the non-parole period as the former has discussed only section 18(2) and (4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. 
[48] The Supreme Court in Kean v State CAV0007 of 2015: 23 October 2015[2015] FJSC 27where the Court of Appeal had fixed a non-parole period of 13 years to the head sentence of 14 years, made the following observations on section 27(2) and 28(1) of the (then Prisons and Corrections Act 2006 (currently named as Corrections Services Act, 2006) when confronted with a similar challenge to the fixing of a non-parole period by the Court of Appeal which, according to the Appellant, made the sentence more severe.Kean has not referred to ToraorSingh.
 ‘...but in the light of the way the sections have been drafted, it looks as if an offender does not have the legal right to have any part of his sentence remitted. Whether he might have a legitimate expectation that one-third of his sentence would be remitted if he was of ""good behaviour"" while in prison is another matter.
 ‘Unless the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender made the fixing of a non-parole period inappropriate, the court sentencing an offender to imprisonment for life or for a term of two years or more must fix a non-parole period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole. A number of authorities have held that this provision was not intended to provide for the early release of offenders once they had completed the non-parole period. The non-parole period was intended to be the minimum period which the offender would have to serve. In other words, it was intended to require the court to ensure that the offender would not be released earlier than the court thought appropriate, whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission. Having said that, there is, as yet, no Parole Board in place in Fiji to consider the release of prisoners on parole.’
 ‘We can take judicial notice that the current practice is to release the offender once he has served two-thirds of the difference between the primary sentence and the non-parole period.’
 ‘The difficulty with this argument is that it focuses, not on ""the prescribed punishment for the offence"", but on how the grant of remission works in practice ......... But it is not the prescribed punishment for the offence which has the effect of making the sentence which the Court of Appeal substituted for that of the trial judge more severe than the one which the trial judge passed. It is how the Commissioner calculates remission in cases where a non-parole period has been fixed.’
[49] The Supreme Court once again in Bogidrau v StateCAV0031 of 2015: 21 April 2016[2016] FJSC 5 had to deal with the challenge to a non-parole period of 05 years on the head sentence of 06 years and 06 months, on the basis that that there was insufficient gap between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The observations of the Supreme Court are as follows. 
 
‘6. Section 18(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree provided that the non-parole period had to be at least 6 months less than the head sentence, and a number of authorities have addressed how long the non-parole period should be, subject, of course, to that provision. Two principles can be identified:
 
(i) ""[T]he non-parole term should not be so close to the head sentence as to deny or discourage the possibility of re-habilitation. Nor should the gap between the non-parole term and the head sentence be such as to be ineffective as a deterrent"": per Calanchini P in Tora v The State[2015] FJCA 20 at [2].
 
(ii) ""[T]he sentencing Court minded to fix a minimum term of imprisonment should not fix it at or less than two thirds of the primary sentence of the Court. It will be wholly ineffective if a minimum sentence finishes prior to the earliest release date if full remission of one third is earned. Experience shows that one third remission is earned in most cases of those sentenced to imprisonment"":Raogo, op cit, at [24].’
 
 
 [50] The Supreme Court in Tora v StateCAV11 of 2015: 22 October 2015[2015] FJSC 23 had quoted from Raogo v The StateCAV 003 of 2010: 19 August 2010 on the legislative intention behind a court having to fix a non-parole period as follows.
 
""The mischief that the legislature perceived was that in serious cases and in cases involving serial and repeat offenders the use of the remission power resulted in these offenders leaving prison at too early a date to the detriment of the public who too soon would be the victims of new offences.""
 
 
 [51] The Supreme Court further said in Bogidrau that :
‘I repeat what I said earlier lest the emphasis I wish to convey is lost. One might have expected the Commissioner's practice to have been to release the prisoner either when he has served two-thirds of his sentence or on the expiry of the non-parole period, whichever is the later. That would reflect both the desirability of encouraging the prisoner's rehabilitation if he has behaved while in prison, as well as the need to reflect the sentencing judge's view of the length of time that the prisoner should actually serve. Many people might say that the Commissioner's current practice does neither. I encourage the Commissioner to review his practice in the light of this judgment.’ (emphasis added)
[52] Thus, Bogidrau had adopted the two principles set out in Tora and Raogo with regard to some guidelines in fixing the non-parole period. On the other hand in both Kean and Bogidrau the Supreme Court indicated that it would be desirable for a prisoner aggrieved by the current practice of remission to seek judicial review so that the court could look into its legality because it is not, according to the Supreme Court, how judges fix the non-parole period but how the remission is presently calculated that makes the sentence more severe. Accordingly, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals in both cases though special leave was granted on the ground of appeal that a non-parole period had been fixed and it had been too close to the head sentence. 
[53] In Turogo v StateCAV0040 of 2016: 20 July 2017[2017] FJSC 17 the Supreme Court had cited Bogidrau with regard to the two principles enunciated in ToraandRaogoi.e.(a) The non-parole term should not be so close to the head sentence as to deny or discourage the possibility of rehabilitation; Nor should the gap between the non-parole term and the head sentence be such as to be ineffective as a deterrent and (b) minimum term of imprisonment should not be fixed at or less than two thirds of the primary sentence of the Court. The Court had also quoted Singhin relation to the Sentencing and Penalties Decreeto the effect that the wording in section 18(1) and 18(2) is not suggestive that the intention of the llegislature in enacting that provision had rehabilitation of offenders in mind but it is deterrence and retribution that Parliament appears to have intended. The Supreme Court had also quoted The Queen v. RadichNZLR 1954 p.86as follows and finally held that the appellant had not been deprived of rehabilitation by the non-parole period of 09 years out of the head sentence of 13 years. 
‘On the other hand, justice and humanity both require that the previous character and conduct, and probable future life and conduct, of the individual offender, and the effect of the sentence on this, should also be given the most careful consideration, although this factor is necessarily subsidiary to the main considerations that determine the appropriate amount of punishment.’
[54] Thus, in my view the decision in Turogo does not in any way diminish the impact of ToraandRaogo as to what matters should be considered when fixing the non-parole period or Turogo should not be taken to state that rehabilitation of the offender should not be considered in the matter of fixing the non-parole period. Therefore, I hold that a trial judge dealing with fixing a non-parole period should give due regard to the principles of ToraandRaogowhich were adopted inBogidrauandTurogo.
[55] Therefore, following the above decisions I do not propose to disturb the non-parole period of 12 years fixed by the Learned High Court Judge on the ground that non-parole period had been fixed too close to the head sentence. It appears that the practice of the trial judges so far has been to maintain a gap of 02 years to 06 months between the non-parole period and the head sentence. I cannot conclude that the gap of 09 months in this case would necessarily deprive the Appellant of rehabilitation, who was 35 years of age at the time of the sentence, and prevent him from integrating into the society as a useful citizen after serving the sentence. 
[56] On the other hand in several appeals that came up before this court during this session the same ground of appeal was urged and the counsel informed this court that the same practice of calculating remission still continues. Perhaps, the Commissioner may be of the view that he has few options in giving effect to section 27(2) of the Corrections Service Act 2006 other than deducting one-third of the balance period, as he possibly cannot encroach upon the non-parole period which a prisoner has to mandatorily serve, as that may tantamount to usurping judicial powers. In fact the Court of Appeal in Raogo has specifically said that a prisoner whose sentence is fixed by a court cannot be released until the fixed period is served and if a prisoner whose sentence is fixed qualifies for remission, he will be eligible for release only after serving the fixed period and in such a situation, the remission has to be deducted from the period of imprisonment that was not fixed. 
[57] However, as suggested by the Supreme Court in Bogidrau if the Commissioner adopts the method where the prisoner is released either when he has served two-thirds of his sentence or on the expiry of the non-parole period, whichever comes later, subject of course to his good behavior as stipulated under section 28(1) Corrections Service Act 2006, the current complaints of so many prisoners could be addressed within the existing framework. If not, there will have to be a judicial review or legislative intervention to bring home a satisfactory solution. 
[58] I shall now turn to the Appellant’s second argument. He insists that the Learned High Court Judge should have given reasons as to why he had decided to fix the non-parole period at 12 years after sentencing him to 12 years and 09 months. Looking at the case record and the sentencing order it does not appear that the Trial Judge has ascribed any reasons for fixing the non-parole period at 12 years so close to the head sentence. No does it appear that the Appellant had been asked to make any submission on that aspect prior to the sentencing order. 
[59] The pronouncement by the Court of Appeal in Toraappeals to me in dealing with the above contention. For the sake of convenience I shall repeat it.
‘Although there is no indication in section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 as to what matters should be considered when fixing the non-parole period, it is my view that the purposes of sentencing set out in section 4(1) should be considered with particular reference to re-habilitation on the one hand and deterrence on the other. As a result the non-parole term should not be so close to the head sentence as to deny or discourage the possibility of re-habilitation. Nor should the gap between the non-parole term and the head sentence be such as to be ineffective as a deterrent.’
[60] One would be able to ascertain whether the trial judge had given his mind to section 4(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 with particular reference to rehabilitation on the one hand and deterrence on the other, only if reasons are set out why a particular non-parole period was fixed in a given case. Such reasons are lacking in the sentencing order of the Trial Judge.
 
[61] The following propositions inAdministrative Law (11th Edition) by H. W. R. Wade & C. F. Forsyth at pages 440-441 and 443 quoting several judicial pronouncements are applicable, in my view, with equal force to judicial decision making as well. 
 
 
“The principles of natural justice do not, as yet, include any general rule that reasons should be given for decisions. Nevertheless there is a strong case to be made for the giving of reasons as an essential element of administrative justice......Unless the citizen can discover the reasoning behind the decision, he may be unable to tell whether it is reviewable or not, and so may be deprived of the protection of the law. A right to reasons therefore an indispensable part of a sound system of judicial review. Natural justice may provide the best rubric for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the ordinary man’s sense of justice. It is also a healthy discipline for all who exercise power over others.”(emphasis added)
 
 
‘The time has now surely come for the court to acknowledge that there is a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions, based on the principle of fairness which permeates administrative law, subject only to specific exceptions to be identified as cases arise..... the presumption should be in favour of giving reasons.’ 
 
 
[62] It was held in R v. Parole Board, ex p Wilson [1992] QB 740 that a prisoner is entitled to be provided with reason, reports and facts adverse to request for parole, so that he could make representations. Failure to make findings of fact and give reasons amounting to a denial of natural justice (vide R v Burton upon Trent Justices, ex p Hussain (1997) 9 Admin LR 233, 237G-H).
 
 
 [63] Another reason that could be adduced as to why a trial judge should give reasons, even briefly, for fixing a certain non-parole period which is particularly very close to the head sentence, is that when vested with a discretion such as conferred by section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, as to why such discretion was so exercised could only be understood if there are reasons disclosed. Giving reasons would obviously rid the decision making process of any arbitrariness and make it transparent in so far as fixing the non-parole period is concerned. 
[64] Therefore, I am of the view that a trial judge exercising discretionary power under section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 should ordinarily give reasons for the decision, particularly when non-parole period is fixed very close to the head sentence so as to almost negate the aspect of re-habilitationof an accused in the society. Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to admit that there may be cases where the decision to fix the non-parole period close to the head sentence is fully justified on the facts and circumstances of the case.
[65] At the same time, it is the duty of an accused to assist the trial judge as to why he deserves a lesser non-parole period and failure to do so may disentitle him from taking up any ground of appeal based on the fixing of the non-parole period.
[66] Therefore, I think that the Appellant’s argument that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to give reasons for fixing 12 years as the non-parole period has merit in as much as the High Court Judge does not appear to have been mindful of the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in Tora in fixing the non-parole period. Perhaps, the Trial Judge may have entertained good reasons in doing so given that he had cited several decisions where the extreme gravity of similar offences have been expressed by the appellate courts indicating that deterrence had weighed more in his mind than rehabilitation. The Learned Trial Judge was in the best position to evaluate the degree of weight to be attached to deterrence and rehabilitation in this case. 
[67] I remind myself of the strong sentiments expressed by many a decision (for example seeKasim, Drotini, Raj, The State of Punjab vsGurmit Singh & others1996 AIR 1393, 1996 SCC (2) 384,Lokesh Mishra v. State of NCT Delhi CRL. A. 768/2010 decided on 12 March 2014 by the High Court of Delhi, Matasavui v State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0036 of 2013: 30 September 2016 [2016] FJCA 118)on ever increasing surge in sexual crimes against children, juveniles, teenagers and adults of both sexes. 
[68] In the circumstances, given the totality of the material available to us, I do think that there are overwhelming reasons why the court should interfere with the non-parole period fixed by the Trial Judge which does not offend provisions in section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. Therefore, while agreeing with the Appellant’s contention that there were no reasons given for the non-parole period fixed, I do not think that this is a fit case to interfere with the non-parole period of 12 years. 
[69] The facts of the case speak to the extreme gravity of the offences committed by the Appellant on his step daughter. Sentences on such offences should reflect the highest possible decree of deterrence within the law to the prospective offenders who may otherwise be tempted to take advantage of children of tender years, who are most vulnerable to fall prey to them, to satisfy their sexual desires. Sentences on sexual crimes, particularly on children should also reflect the strongest disapproval of the society to such attempts to treat children as ‘easy targets’, particularly by ‘family rapists’.
 
[70] Therefore, I conclude that the ground 4(b) of the appeal on the sentence should also be rejected.
 
 
[71] Therefore, I would conclude that the appeal should stand dismissed and the conviction and sentences be affirmed. 
 
 
Fernando, JA 
 
 
[72] I agree with the reasons and conclusions of Prematilaka, JA.
 
 
The Orders of the Court are:
 
  
• Appeal is dismissed.
 
• Conviction and sentence are affirmed.

73,801,74642,"SENTENCE

1. The Director of Public Prosecution has preferred a charge against you in the following manner.

TEVITA DRAUNIDALO is charged with the following offence:-

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

TEVITA DRAUNIDALO sometimes in the month of May 2010 at Yadua Island, Bua in the Northern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge with UNAISI ADIBABASIGA a girl under the age of 13 years.

2. When your case was taken up before the Learned Magistrate on the 23rd August 2010, you have pleaded guilty to the charge in the information. On accepting your plea of guilty the Learned Magistrate had referred the matter to the High Court for sentencing.

3. When the matter was taken up at the High Court on the 30th August 2010, plea was taken afresh. Where you have pleaded guilty and admitted the facts of the case also. After considering your plea of guilty is unequivocal, I convicted you for the charge set out in the information.

4. You were found guilty for rape which is punishable under Section 207(1) (3) of the Crimes Decree 2009.

5. Section 207(1) (3) of the Crimes Decree states as follows:

207.-(1) Any person who rapes another person commits an indictable offence.

Penalty – Imprisonment for life.

(3) For this section, a child under the age of 13 years is incapable of giving consent.

6. As per the above section the punishment, is imprisonment for life.

7. Now I consider the tariff to the offence.

In the case of Drotini v The State [2006] FJCA 26; AAU001.2005S (24 March 2006) reflected on the seriousness of the offence and that the victim was the step daughter of the appellant, and at the time of the first offences, the victim was nine or ten years old. Hence upheld the 11 year sentence. However before giving the ruling the court acknowledged that the offence warrants a more severe punishment.

""We consider that the facts of this case merited a sentence of more than eleven years but we do not consider the sentence so manifestly lenient that we should interfere.""

This gives a clear indication on where the courts stand with regards to sexual abuse of children.

8. In the case of State v Talenasila [2010] FJHC 84; HAC011.2010 (12 March 2010) his Lordship Justice Madigan when delivering his judgment quoted cases to reflect on the seriousness of charge of Rape.

""Rape is the most serious sexual offence. The Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime, by hardening their hearts to offenders and by meting out harsh sentence.""

His Lordship then stated:

The rape in the present case and the indecent assaults were a gross breach of trust. A 14 year old is still not mature and the animal behaviour of her father will surely scar her for the rest of her life. The Courts cannot ignore the severity of such behaviour. It is a breach of trust of the worst kind and a destruction of a father/daughter relationship.

9. In the case of State v Cakau [2010] FJHC 141; HAC010.2010 (24 April 2010) his Lordship Justice Priyantha Fernando when delivering his sentence he also reflected on the nature of the offending:

Facts of the case are that you raped your own niece. The victim was 11 years old at the time of the offence. When she was going home after school you followed her and removed her panty and raped her. When she shouted you covered her mouth. While she was crying you raped her.

The aggravating factors are that you are the uncle of the victim and therefore you are in a position of a special trust and you have breached that trust. The victim is 11 years old and could have expected safety and security from you as uncle. This is surely scar her for the rest of her life and further you raped her while going home after school.

Finally his Lordship sentenced the accused to 11 years imprisonment. 

10. Considering the above cases the tariff will be from 11 years to 16 years.

11. Considering the nature of the offence, I commence your sentencing at 12 years.

12. Considering the aggravating factors as follows.

a) The victim was 12 years and 8 months old.

I increase 2 years to your sentence. Now your sentence is 14 years.

13. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances.

a) You have pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity.

b) You are 21 years old.

c) You are first offender.

d) No violence used against the victim.

e) You are remorseful.

14. Considering your mitigating circumstances, I reduce 4 years. Now your sentence is 10 years imprisonment.

15. You are imposed of 10 years imprisonment.

16. 30 days to appeal.

• MANUELI NAKACIA , you pleaded guilty to one count of Abduction of Person under 18 years to have carnal knowledge contrary to section 211 of the Crimes Act No 44 of 2009(“Crimes Act”). 
 
•  You also admitted on 28th October 2015 at Visoto Village , Ovalua you took the victim away without the consent of the guardian ( mother) to a nearby house and after lying about the name and marital status had sexual intercourse with her. Because of that she got pregnant. 
 
• I am satisfied about your plea and convict you for this offence. 
 
• The maximum penalty for Abduction of Person under 18 years of age with intent to have carnal knowledge is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
• In State v Kartik [2012] FJHC 840 his Lordship Justice Madigan held that tariff for this offence is from 12 months to 03 years.
 
• In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Goundar discussed the guiding principles for determining the starting point in sentencing in the following manner: 

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. 
 
  
• Considering the objective seriousness, I select 16 months as the starting point for this sentence. 
 
• The aggravating factor is using the deception to commit this offence and for that I add 06 months to reach 22 months imprisonment. 
 
• The learned counsel from the legal aid submitted following as mitigating factors in the mitigation submission :  
• 25 years old;
 
• Married with small child; 
 
• First offender;
 
• Seeking forgiveness and willing to reform. 
 

 
• In Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014) his Lordship Chief Justice Anthony Gates held that in Rape cases little weight can be given for personal mitigating factors of an accused. 
 
• In my view this applies to other sexual offences also and this also falls in to that category. Hence I disregard your personal mitigating factors. But for your past good behavior, I deduct 04 months to reach 18 months imprisonment. 
 
• You pleaded guilty early saving the victim from giving evidence and for that I deduct 1/3 to reach 12 months imprisonment. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend your sentence. 
 
• The purpose of this law is to protect the young girls in Fiji from men with lascivious intentions. I find you fall in to that this category of predatory men who prey on the vulnerable girls in this country. . Hiding your name and marital status, you had sexual intercourse with the victim which resulted in her getting pregnant. There is no evidence about relationship between the parties. Hence in my view the custodial sentence is warranted to denounce your behavior and protect the young girls in this country from people like you in future. 
 
• MANUELI NAKACIA ,Accordingly I sentenced you to 12 months imprisonment for this charge.  
• 28 days to appeal.

",1,0,1,0,1,sentence,602
75,803,76536,"JUDGMENT
 
This is an appeal against sentence. The Appellant was convicted on the 28th of March 2001, on his own plea of guilty, to the following offence:
 
Statement of Offence
 
DEFILEMENT OF A GIRL BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE: Contrary to Section 156(1)(a) of the Penal Code, Act 17.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
ELIA DONUMAINASAVA and OTETI VOTEA, between the 1st day of February 2000 and the 28th day of February 2000 at Navua in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of ELENA LAINI, a girl above the age of thirteen years and under the age of sixteen years.
 
The Appellant’s grounds of appeal are that he was a first offender, that he had no criminal intention, that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse, that he thought she was mature, and that he deserved leniency.
 
In the Magistrates Court, the Appellant told the learned Magistrate, in mitigation, that he was 22 years old, worked at the Yarawa Saw Mill, earned $72.00 a week and was a first offender. The facts of the case, as outlined by the prosecution, were that the complainant was 15 years old, and a Form 3 student. She stayed with her parent at Yarawa. On the night in question, she was at home with a sister when the Appellant knocked at the door. He and the complainant then had sexual intercourse. He then left, and his co-accused then entered and had sexual intercourse with her. In August 2000, the complainant’s mother discovered that her daughter was pregnant. She was told that she had had sexual intercourse with the Appellant.
 
The Appellant and his co-accused admitted the offence and were charged. The learned Magistrate in his sentencing remarks said that the offence was serious and prevalent, that the Appellant and his co-accused had stopped the education of the complainant, that they had committed the offence in the village, and that a custodial sentence was called for. He had adjourned sentence to allow both men to spend Christmas and New Year with their families, but sentenced them to 2 years imprisonment, after giving discount of three years imprisonment, for the guilty pleas and good character.
 
At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant expressed remorse and said he had asked the complainant’s father for forgiveness. State Counsel opposed the appeal, saying that the sentence was right in principle, and that due weight had been given to the guilty plea and the lack of previous convictions.
 
The learned Magistrate was correct in finding that the Defilement of Girls between the ages of 13 and 16 is prevalent in Fiji. Although the reporting rate of this offence is not known, police statistics show an increase in reports of sexual intercourse with children. As State Counsel correctly points out, consent of the girl is irrelevant to the commission of the offence. It is also irrelevant to sentence. If the complainant had not consented, the Appellant would have been charged with Rape. A charge under section 156(1)(a) of the Penal Code is specifically designed for consensual sexual intercourse with girls under the age of consent. The offence is clearly designed to protect young girls, who have entered puberty and who are experiencing social and hormonal changes, from sexual exploitation. The offence carries a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. Reported cases in Fiji and abroad show that sentences passed range from suspended sentences (usually where the accused and victim are both of the same or similar age, and are in a relationship) to 3/4 years imprisonment where the accused is in a position of trust in relation to the victim, and much older than her.
 
In England the maximum sentence of this offence is two years imprisonment under Sexual Offences Act 1956. In R -v- Taylor and Others 64 Cr. App. R. 182, the English Court of Appeal laid down guidelines for the sentencing of persons convicted of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16. Lord Justice Lawton distinguished between cases of “virtuous friendship” between young people of the same age which ended in sexual intercourse, and cases where a man in a supervisory capacity set out to seduce a girl under sixteen. In the first type of case, custodial sentences were not needed; in the second, sentences of the maximum of two years, or near that scale, should be imposed.
 
In Fiji of course the maximum sentence is 5 years imprisonment and the learned Magistrate quite rightly commenced at 3 years imprisonment.
 
On the facts of this case, it would appear that a custodial sentence was inevitable. Firstly the Appellant was the complainant’s boyfriend (medical report of the complainant), secondly the complainant is now pregnant and has dropped out of school, thirdly the Appellant came with the 2nd accused and the result is that the complainant does not know who the father of her child his. Lastly the Appellant is 7 years older than the complainant, and should have been trusted not to have committed the offence with his under-aged girlfriend.
 
The mitigating circumstances are that the Appellant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and that he is a first offender. However, both these factors were taken into account by the learned Magistrate. He did not err in principle and I consider that the sentence passed was not manifestly excessive.
 
For these reasons, this appeal is dismissed.

76,804,274880,"JUDGMENT
 
 
1. The appellant was charged with the offence of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212 of the Crimes Act 2009. It was alleged the appellant on the 14th day of May, 2013 at Tavua unlawfully and indecently assaulted Menaz Nazia Ali. 
 
  
• The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and the matter proceeded to trial. The prosecution called one witness, the victim and the defence called four witnesses including the accused. 
 
 
• By judgment dated 29 May, 2018 the Magistrate’s Court at Tavua found the appellant guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. On the same day after mitigation the appellant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Bearing in mind the need for rehabilitation the learned Magistrate did not impose a non-parole period.
 
 
• Being dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence the appellant filed a timely appeal against conviction and sentence as follows: 
 

 APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
 
 
 GROUND ONE
 
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law in fact in not directing himself to the evidence of the complainant/witness and as such proper directions ought to have been given regarding taking oath. The failure to do so caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
 GROUND TWO
 
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration that apart from the evidence of the complainant, there was no other independent evidence against the Appellant to prove the case against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt.  
 
 
 GROUND THREE
 
The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing/misdirecting the previous inconsistent statements/evidence made by the Prosecution witnesses and as such there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
GROUND FOUR
 
 The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the possible defence on evidence presented in court and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 GROUND FIVE
 
 The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself adequately and/or taking into consideration that the complaint was lodged several days later after the alleged incident and this would have raised serious doubts as to the credibility of the complainant. The failure to consider the delay caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
 GROUND SIX
 
 The learned trial Magistrate erred in law in not giving cogent reasons as to why the accused and his witnesses were not believed by the learned trial Magistrate and the failure to do so caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 GROUND SEVEN
 
 The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the possible defences on evidence and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
  
 
 GROUND EIGHT
 
 The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact not taking into consideration that the alibi that was raised by the accused was not negative by the prosecution and hence a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 GROUND NINE
 
 The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact not taking into serious consideration withdrawal statements that were made by the complainant against the accused. The failure to do so caused substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 GROUND TEN (Additional ground of appeal) 
 
The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he delivered the judgment against the appellant over 4 years after hearing and sentence delivering thereafter was in breach of section 14(2)(g) of the Constitution of Fiji and as such a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 
 APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
 
 GROUND ELEVEN
 
The Appellant’s appeal against sentence being manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in [principle] in all the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 GROUND TWELVE
 
The learned Trial Magistrate took irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the Appellant.
 
 
5. The brief summary of facts is:
 
 
On 14 May, 2013 at about 8:30am the victim (the daughter-in-law of the accused) was sweeping the kitchen. The wife of the accused was attending to other chores outside the house. The victim was alone in the kitchen. After a while the accused came into the kitchen between the table and the freezer and from behind grabbed the victim. The victim wanted to move herself but could not. The accused held her tightly, held her breast, kissed her on the neck and continued to hold her tightly. She tried to push the accused but couldn’t. The accused inserted his hand into the victim’s panty. The victim was scared and tried to push the accused, at this time the accused made love bite on the victim’s neck.
 
 
6. The matter was reported to the police by the victim. The accused was arrested, interviewed and charged. 
 
  
• Both counsel filed written submissions and also made oral submissions during the hearing for which this court is grateful.
 
 
• On the day of the hearing the learned counsel for the appellant abandoned the following grounds of appeal namely grounds 1, 2 and 4 in respect of appeal against conviction. 
 

 GROUNDS OF APPEAL
 
 
 GROUND THREE 
 
 The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing/misdirecting the previous inconsistent statements/evidence made by the Prosecution witnesses and as such there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• The appellant’s counsel submits that the defence during the course of the proceedings had put to the complainant her police statement. The complainant had given one version to the police when facts were fresh in her mind and she gave another version in court. Counsel argues this affected her credibility as a witness and the learned Magistrate had failed to take this aspect into consideration.
 
 
• This court notes that the learned Magistrate had not made any observations about the police statement the victim had given to the police with her evidence in court when she was cross examined by defence counsel.
 
 
• On about five occasions the defence counsel had put to the complainant her police statement in respect of the charge. 
 

a). At page 29 of the copy record the following is recorded:
 
 
 “Q126: Nothing wrong to invite someone to sleep with you?
 
 A: I didn’t like what my father-in-law said.
 
 Q127: Stated in your statement?
 
 A: Yes but officer didn’t write it down in statement”...
 
 
12. b). At page 32 of the copy record the following is recorded:
 
 
 “Q194: What’s wrong with saying for you to go into his room?
 
A: Yes he said for me to sleep with him. Shown statement – only reads accused said to go into his room. 
 
 Q195: Is it in statement?
 
 A: No.”
 
 
 c). At page 33 of the copy record the following is recorded:
 
 
 “Q. 202: What’s in kitchen?
 
 A: 2 tables size of bar tables. There’s also freezer cabinet.
 
 Q. 203: You told police only one table?
 
 A: I am only describing one table where incident occurred.
 
 Q. 204: What happened?
 
 A: He hold me from back.
 
 Q.205: You told police in statement?
 
 A: No.
 
 Q. 206: Why didn’t you tell police?
 
 A: I just informed them he grabbed me and I tried to push him.
 
 
 Q. 207: How do you push him?
 
 A: I was using my elbow.
 
 Q. 208: You didn’t state in statement?
 
 A: No.
 
 Q. 209: You tried to push him?
 
 A: When he grabbed me I turned around.”
 
 
13. d). At page 35 of the copy record the following is recorded:
 
 
 Q. 240: 13/5/13 he did something to you?
 
 A: He held my breast.
 
 Q. 241: you told police?
 
 A: I can’t recall.
 
 Q. It’s not recorded that 13/5/13 he held breast?
 
 A: No on 14/5/13 he held my breast not 13/5/13.”
 
 
e). At page 40 of the copy record the following is recorded as follows:
 
 
 “Q. 328: Other hand inside panty?
 
 A: Just place there half way, I tried to pull it but couldn’t. 
 
 
 Q. 329: You pulled both hands? 
 
 A: Yes.
 
 
 Q.330: It’s not contained in statement to police?
 
 A: It’s just half way that’s what I stated to police. 
 
 
 Q.331: Only one hand placed in panty as stated to police but he put both hands in statement. You tried to pull his hands out?
 
 A: Yes.” 
 
  
• When one looks at the above questions and answers and/or the explanations given by the victim the omissions, contradictions and discrepancies do not discredit the entire evidence of the victim. The learned Magistrate when assessing the evidence believed the victim which suggests the evidence of the victim holistically was not affected. 
 
• Passage of time has an effect upon a person’s memory, it is important to note that the omissions, contradictions and discrepancies relate to peripheral issues which were not significant to affect the reliability of the victim’s evidence. The victim was steadfast in her evidence of what the appellant had done to her and her evidence in this regard was not shaken at all during the vigorous cross examination. 
 
• The Supreme Court of India in a judgment arising from a conviction for rape in  Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat [1983] AIR 753, 1983 SCR (3) 280) made the following pertinent observations:

 “Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance. More so when the all-important ""probabilities-factor"" echoes in 
 
favour of the version narrated by the witnesses. The reasons are: (1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen; ... (3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not... It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder; (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends. On the 'timesense' of individuals which varies from person to person...”
 
  
• In Josua Natakuru v The State, criminal appeal no. HAA 22 of 2016 Aluthge J. made the following observations at paragraph 12: 

 It is well settled that even if there are some omissions, contradictions and discrepancies, the entire evidence cannot be discredited or disregarded. Thus an undue importance should not be attached to omissions, contradictions and discrepancies, which do not go to the heart of the matter and shake the basic version of the prosecution’s witnesses.
  
• Similar sentiments were echoed by Justice Shameem in Vinod Prasad v The State, criminal appeal no. HAA 055 of 2003S where Her Ladyship said:

  Indeed, there is no law that requires witnesses to give evidence strictly in accordance with their statements. Most witnesses give greater or lesser detail in court. Much depends on their memories, the skill of whoever took their statement and the way their evidence is led in court. Inconsistencies between statement and evidence may assist the court in weighing up reliability and credibility. However the out-of-court statements are not evidence. What is said in the witness box is evidence. 
 
  
• A human mind does not have a photographic memory they are bound to be some omissions, contradictions and discrepancies between what a person had told the police when giving the police statement compared to his or her evidence in court after a lapse of time. 
 
 
• The omissions, contradictions and discrepancies pointed out by the defence counsel during trial did not affect the reliability of the victim’s evidence that is the reason why the learned Magistrate did not direct his mind to the previous inconsistent statement of the victim in his judgment. 
 

21. This ground of appeal is dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
 GROUND FIVE
 
 The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself adequately and/or taking into consideration that the complaint was lodged several days later after the alleged incident and this would have raised serious doubts as to the credibility of the complainant. The failure to consider the delay caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
 
  
• The victim was the daughter-in-law of the appellant who was living with her husband as part of the extended family under one roof. From the evidence it is obvious that the in-laws had control over what was happening in the house. The victim was not at liberty to leave the house as she would have liked to. The only way out of the house was for the victim to lie to her in-laws as to where she was going to. This aspect of the victim’s evidence was taken into consideration by the learned Magistrate at paragraph 24 of the judgment as: 
 

“... I accept that PW1 admitted that she was lying to her in laws that she was going to the hospital when she instead went to police to report. According to PW1, her in laws didn’t send her to report the matter to police and that is why she lied that she was going to the hospital...”
 
  
• The date of the allegation was 14 May, 2013 and the report was lodged by the victim to the police on 17 May, 2013. The delay was not substantial considering the circumstances of the victim. The victim reported the matter to the police when the opportunity presented itself. As per the evidence of the victim she had informed her mother-in-law and her husband after the incident but both did not believe her (page 21 and 22 of the copy record).
 

24. This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
 GROUND SIX
 
 “The learned trial Magistrate erred in law in not giving cogent reasons as to why the accused and his witnesses were not believed by the learned trial Magistrate and the failure to do so caused a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Magistrate had failed to give cogent reasons why he did not believe the accused and the defence witnesses.
 
 
• From paragraph 18 to paragraph 23 of the judgment the learned Magistrate discussed the defence case and made reference to the evidence of all the defence witnesses.
 
 
• At paragraph 19 the learned trial Magistrate after assessing the demeanour of the appellant and his wife came to the conclusion that they were evasive and untruthful. The court rejected the assertion by the appellant that he did not have access to his own house. The appellant had told the court he does not have access to go inside the house before he goes to the farm and that he does not go into the kitchen. The learned Magistrate concluded that the reasons given by the appellant was illogical.
 
 
• In rejecting the evidence of the appellant’s wife (DW3) the learned Magistrate stated that it cannot be true that DW3 was always with the appellant in whatever he does and wherever he goes in particular when the appellant had informed the court that he had gone to the house of DW1( Atteh Mohammed) on 15th and 16th May alone. Furthermore, the learned Magistrate had found the wife of the appellant to be an evasive witness as well.
 
 
• This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of any merits.
 

GROUND SEVEN
 
 “The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the possible defence on evidence presented in court and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Magistrate had failed to direct his mind to the possible defences which was available to the appellant as the evidence had unfolded. 
 
 
• The appellant had relied on the defence of alibi. The appellant in his defence was suggesting that he was not inside the house where the alleged incident had taken place. At paragraph 23 of the judgment the learned Magistrate did direct his mind to the defence of alibi raised by the appellant during the course of the hearing as follows:
 

“The evidence of DW1 was basically to establish alibi in relation to certain incidents raised by PW1 on 15/5/13 and 16/5/13. I do accept as per the evidence that accused was at DW1’s place from 6am – 9pm on 15/5/13 and 16/5/13 and that PW1’s evidence may be unreliable in that regard. However, the alibi raised is peripheral to the principal charge on 14/5/13. I still find PW1’s evidence in relation to the principal charge on 14/5/13 as credible and believable.”
 
  
• The learned Magistrate had correctly directed his mind to the defence raised by the appellant which was clearly obvious from the evidence and no error can be attributed to the learned Magistrate in this respect. 
 
 
• The fact that defence counsel during the cross examination of the victim had raised delay in reporting to police, no one had seen the love bite on the neck of the complainant, withdrawal of complaint before an advisory councilor did not tantamount to possible defences but went to the credibility of the complainant. The only defence relied upon by the defence at trial was alibi which was properly addressed by the learned Magistrate. 
 

34. This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
GROUND EIGHT
 
 “The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact not taking into consideration that the alibi that was raised by the accused was not negative by the prosecution and hence a substantial miscarriage of justice.
 
  
• As part of his defence of alibi the appellant called Atteh Mohammed (DW1) who informed the court that on 15 May, 2013 and 16 May, 2013 the accused was at the house of DW1 (Atteh Mohammed) from 6am to 6pm which was accepted by the learned Magistrate.
 
 
• The appellant’s wife (DW3) told the court in her evidence that she was always with the appellant inside the house and would always see him when he was inside the house.
 
 
• When the defence of alibi is raised it is incumbent upon the prosecution to disprove that defence beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal in Laisenia Bese and Are Amae v. The State AAU 0067 of 2011 confirmed the above principle of law at paragraphs 9 and 10 as follows:

“[9] ...In Rex v Anderson [1991] Crim. L.R. 361 the Court of Appeal stated that (pg. 362) “It was certainly better if a judge when dealing with an alibi defence repeated that the burden was on the Crown to disprove it...”
 
[10] Beldam L.J in Robert David George Haron [1996] 2 Cr App R 451 at 461 held that, “The jury would have understood that they had not only to be sure that the alibi was wrong, they had to be sure that the Crown evidence was right...”
 
  
• The prosecution disproved the defence of alibi whilst cross examining the appellant and his wife which led to the learned Magistrate concluding that they were not to be believed. On the other hand, the learned Magistrate accepted the evidence of the victim who maintained that the accused was present in the kitchen on 14 May, 2013 at about 8.30am when the appellant’s wife was not in the house. 
 
 
• The learned Magistrate accepted the evidence of the victim as reliable and truthful and rejected the evidence of the appellant and his wife who were found to be evasive. In this way the prosecution had disproved the defence of alibi beyond reasonable doubt.
 

40. This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
GROUND NINE
 
 “The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact not taking into serious consideration withdrawal statements that were made by the complainant against the accused. The failure to do so caused substantial miscarriage of justice”
 
  
• The appellant’s counsel submits that the victim had made a written statement in which she indicated her wish to withdraw her complaint. Counsel further stated that the letter of withdrawal was signed by the victim in front of the advisory councilor and justice of peace. 
 
 
• At paragraph 25 of the judgment the learned Magistrate when considering the issue of withdrawal of victim stated inter alia:
 

“...It was only after she reported the matter to police that the allegation of withdrawal statement came up. As I see it, the withdrawal statement was initiated not by PW1 but by accused and his family, to safeguard accused interest.”
 
 
43. The following cross examination at page 49 of the copy record is relevant:
 
 
 Q.506: You gave statement to police later on about withdrawing charges?
 
 A: Yes.
 
 
 Q.507: What you tell Police?
 
 A: I gave statement to advisory.
 
 
 Q. 508: What did you tell advisory?
 
 A: I didn’t say anything.
 
 
 Q.509: Who is advisory.
 
 A: Sarojini.
 
 
 Q.510: You told her you want to withdraw?
 
 A: Yes.
 
 
 Q.511: See your signature?
 
 A: Yes.
 
 
 Q.513: If you didn’t want to withdraw why then did you sign?
 
 A: Ms. Sarojini forced me to sign. She said we are separate therefore I can sign. She told me to [leave] father-in-law as we like in same compound.”
 
 
44. The above was taken into consideration by the learned Magistrate at paragraph 24 as:
 
 
 “... I also accept her evidence that she was forced by accused and her family through the advisory counselor and the JP to make withdrawal statements.”
 
  
• Section 56 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with the institution of proceedings in the Magistrates court as follows:
 

 56 (1) Criminal proceedings may be instituted by –
 
 
a) the making of a complaint in accordance with this Part; or
 
 
(b) by bringing a person before a magistrate after the person has
 been arrested without warrant.
 
 
 (2) Any person who believes from a reasonable and probable cause that
 an offence has been committed by any person may file a complaint with a Magistrates Court.
 
 
(3) A complaint may be made under this section orally or in writing.
 
 
(4) f a complaint is made orally it shall be reduced to writing by the
 
 Magistrates Court, and shall be signed by the complainant and the officer of the Magistrates Court authorised to receive the complaint.
 
 
(5) Where proceedings are instituted by a police officer or other officer
 acting in the course of a lawful duty, a formal charge duly signed by the police officer or other officer may be presented to the Magistrates Court and shall, for the purposes of this [Act], be deemed to be a complaint.
 
 
(6) Upon receiving any complaint (unless such complaint has been laid in the form of a formal charge under sub-section (5), the Magistrates Court shall–
 
 
 (a) draw up or cause to be drawn up a formal charge containing a
 statement of the offence with which the accused is charged; and
 
 
 (b) issue the formal charge in accordance with procedures approved
 by the Chief Magistrate.
 
 
(7) When an accused person who has been arrested without a warrant is brought before a magistrate, a formal charge containing a statement of the offence with which the accused is charged shall be signed and presented by the police officer preferring the charge.
 
  
• The Supreme Court of Queensland in Potts v Brooks, ex parte Potts (1983) 2 Qd. R. 48) held that; 

""the term complainant means the person who makes the complaint before a justice of the peace and initiates proceedings and does not mean necessarily the person injured by the conduct complained of"".
 
Pain J. in State v Wainiqolo (1998) FJHC 29; HAA 0117d.97s. (5 March 1998) found that the complainant in the Magistrate’s Court was the police officer who signed the complaint under section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Code, (now Section 56 of the Criminal Procedure Act), where His Lordship held that; 
 
“In terms of Section 203, the complainant did not appear. The complainant is the Police Officer who signed the complaint under section 78...”
 
  
• In my judgment the complainant in the proceedings at the Magistrate’s Court was the police officer who made the complaint to the Magistrate’s Court. 
 
 
• In criminal proceedings a complaint is made by a public official namely a police officer, the victim is only a witness. It is the prerogative of the prosecuting agency or the Director of Public Prosecutions whether a complaint is withdrawn or not. The victim had clearly stated in her evidence that she was forced into signing the letter of withdrawal. Even if she wanted to withdraw her complaint this was not possible since she was only a witness in the case. The offence was committed against the State so the victim had no legal basis to withdraw the complainant. The learned Magistrate was correct in not giving any weight to the letter of withdrawal signed by the victim which was obviously signed under duress. 
 

49. This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
 
 
 GROUND TEN
 
“The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he delivered the judgment against the appellant over 4 years after hearing and sentence delivering thereafter was in breach of section 14(2)(g) of the Constitution of Fiji and as such a substantial miscarriage of justice.”
 
  
• The counsel for the appellant submitted that on 29 April, 2014 the victim gave evidence (page 20 of the copy record) on 12 February, 2018 the accused and his witness gave evidence (page 58 of the Copy Record) and on 29 May, 2018 the accused was sentenced (page 15 of the copy record). Counsel relies on the case of Mohammed Janif v State, Criminal Appeal no. HAA 18 of 2018 (21 August, 2018), in that appeal Madigan J. had held that since the judgment was delivered nearly 2 years after hearing and sentence was delivered 19 months thereafter, the appellant’s Constitutional right under section 14 (2)(g) had been breached. 
 
 
• When one looks at the reasoning of Madigan J. at paragraphs 25, 27, 29 and 30 of Janif’s case the evidence adduced in the Magistrate’s Court was weak to sustain a conviction. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any delay caused by the appellant which had led to the delay in the completion of the trial and the subsequent judgment. 
 
 
• Here the victim started giving evidence on 29 April, 2014, cross examination started the same day. The defence counsel asked for an adjournment (page 36 of the copy record).
 
 
• On 6 May, 2014 the cross examination continued, after the close of prosecution case the defence raised that the prosecution be compelled not to close its case but to call other witnesses and that there was no case to answer on the evidence adduced. After exchange of submissions between the prosecution and defence on 25 August, 2014 the learned Magistrate refused the application of the defence and ruled that the appellant had a case to answer.
 
 
• After numerous adjournments at the request of the defence counsel the matter was assigned a hearing date for 9 November, 2015. On this day the defence counsel sought the trial be vacated due to a High Court trial on the same date. It was only on 12 February, 2018 the defence opened its case and the trial was completed. The judgment was delivered on 29 May, 2018. 
 
 
• A perusal of the copy record clearly shows that it was the defence that was dragging the matter after the court had ruled that the appellant had a case to answer. The appellant obviously knew what was happening after counsel instructed by him appeared not too keen to open the defence case. In the circumstances the appellant has waived his right to complain and cannot therefore complain about the lateness in his trial and then seek refuge under section 14 (2) (g) of the Constitution which states that every person charged with an offence has the right to have the trial begin and conclude without unreasonable delay.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate did not delay the matter after the trial was completed the judgment was delivered a little over 3 months. Furthermore, the judgment in its totality when compared with the evidence does not suggest that the delay in the completion of the trial had any impact on the assessment of the evidence, finding of credibility and application of the facts to the law. The conclusion reached by the learned Magistrate was in accordance with the evidence adduced at trial. 
 

57. This ground of appeal is also dismissed due to lack of merits. 
 
 
 
 
 
 APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
 
 GROUND ELEVEN
 
 “The Appellant’s appeal against sentence being manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in [principle] in all the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
 
 GROUND TWELVE
 
 “The learned Trial Magistrate took irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the Appellant.”
 
 
58. Both grounds of appeal will be addressed together. 
 
 
 LAW
 
  
• The Supreme Court of Fiji in Simeli Bili Naisua vs. The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV0010 of 2013 (20 November 2013) stated the grounds for appeal against sentence at paragraph 19 as:-
 

“It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate Courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:-
 
 
(i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
 
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
 
(iii) Mistook the facts;
 
 
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration.”
 
 
60. Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Magistrate did not give adequate consideration to the Sentencing and Penalties Act by failing to properly assess the appellant’s culpability and degree of responsibility as required by section 4(2) (d) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, the appellant’s previous good character, the general reputation of the appellant and the contributions made by the appellant to the community.
 
 
61. Furthermore counsel submits that the learned Magistrate did not take into account the fact that the incident happened in 2013 and the decision was given after five years of suffering and stress by the appellant which was a mitigating factor. 
 
 
62. At paragraph 3 of the sentence the learned Magistrate considered the following mitigation on behalf of the appellant. 
 
  
• At your age of 64 years this is your first offence.
 
• You are married with 5 children.
 
• You are a farmer and have your own production from the farm.
 
• You maintain you are innocent.”
 
 
• The learned Magistrate had taken into account all the relevant mitigating factors under broad headings. 
 
• It is not for an Appellate Court to revisit mitigation which was all before the Magistrate at the time of sentencing unless manifest injustice will be caused to the appellant (see Josaia Leone & Sakiusa Naulumatua vs. State [2011] HAA 11 of 2011 (8 July, 2011). 
 
• The learned Magistrate had complied with the purposes of the sentencing guidelines stated in section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act and the factors that must be taken into account namely section 4 (2) (j).
 
• It is not incumbent upon a court to list and consider every point made by counsel. The court will of course consider and adopt all points that are relevant. 
 
• Furthermore, there is no requirement of the law that where there are several mitigating factors each one of them should be dealt with separately. The Supreme Court in Solomone Qurai vs. The State, Criminal Petition No. CAV 24 of 2014 (20th August, 2015) stated this very clearly at paragraph 53 in the following words:-

 “Although section 4 (2) (j) of the Sentencing and Penalties [Act] requires the High Court Judge to have regard to the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence, there is no requirement that in any case where there are several mitigating circumstances, each one of them should be dealt with separately...”
  
• Counsel also submitted that the delay in the finality of his matter which happened in 2013 was a form of punishment which should have reduced the sentence even further. Counsel relied on State v Alipate Sorovanalagi and others [2012] FJHC 1135; HAR 006 of 2012 (31 May 2012) in particular to paragraphs 36 and 37:
 

 Paragraph 36
 
The age of the offence or any post charge delay, if applicable, is relevant when it comes to sentencing. In Sahim v the State, Misc. Action No.17 of 2007, the Court of Appeal said at paragraph 29:
 
""...Where the issue is raised on appeal, and the appellant was fairly tried despite the delay, his or her remedy lies in the proportionate reduction of sentence or in the imposition of a non-custodial sentence.""
 
 
Paragraph 37
 
In Boolell v The State (Mauritius) [2006]UKPC 46 (16 October 2006), the accused was convicted of swindling and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, after 12 years of post charge delay. By the time his appeal was heard by the Privy Council, the post charge delay was 15 years. The Privy Council found that although the delay in holding trial was unreasonable, the trial was fair and the conviction should stand. The Privy Council outlined the appropriate remedy for the accused person's breach of right to be tried within a reasonable time at paragraph 39:
 
""The Board must therefore determine the remedy which is to be afforded to the appellant. In the light of its finding that the trial was not unfair, the Board does not consider that the conviction should be set aside. On the other hand, their Lordships would not regard it as acceptable that the prison sentence imposed by the Intermediate Court should be put into operation some 15 years after the commission of the offence unless the public interest affirmatively required a custodial sentence, even at this stage. This is not such a case, and their Lordships will set aside the prison sentence and substitute for it a fine...""
  
• The argument by counsel that the learned Magistrate should have given the appellant a discount since the charges were hanging over his head for 5 years was a form of punishment is misconceived. The appellant had pleaded not guilty and had maintained this throughout his trial which was his right. After the prosecution had closed its case the defence had time and again asked for more time to open its case. The defence counsel had the opportunity to ask for an early hearing date but this was not done. 
 
 
• The appellant after causing the delay in having his matter determined by the court cannot rely on the age of the offence or any post charge delay as a mitigating factor to receive a discount or reduction in his sentence, regard must be made to the seriousness of the offence committed and the length of the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this case the age of the offence and the post charge delay are not applicable as a mitigating factor taking in to account the seriousness of the offence committed and the length of the sentence imposed. The case of Sorovanalagi (supra) is distinguished from the present case.
 
 
• The learned Magistrate had properly directed his mind to the mitigation offered by the appellant and had given appropriate discount in exercise of his discretion in the circumstances of the case. The learned trial Magistrate did not err when he allowed 12 months for the appellant’s mitigation and previous good character. 
 

72. The Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj v The State, CAV 0003 of 2014 (20 August, 2014) had made it clear that the personal circumstances of an accused has little mitigatory value in cases of sexual nature.
 
  
• The learned Magistrate had correctly exercised his sentence discretion the final sentence is within the tariff, considering the importance of rehabilitation a non-parole period was not been imposed. This in my judgment is in favour of the appellant. The tariff for the sentence of indecent assault is from 1 year to 4 years. The sentence of 2 years imprisonment is neither harsh nor excessive. The appellant should consider himself lucky to be sentenced on the lower range of the tariff since the manner of the offending does suggest a certain degree of planning which was not taken as an aggravating factor to increase the sentence. 
 

74. The appeal against sentence is dismissed for lack of merits.
 
 
 ORDERS
  
•  The appeal against conviction and sentence are dismissed due to lack of merits.
 
 
•  30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

77,805,78839,"JUDGMENT

On the 12th of August 2004, the Appellant was convicted of the offence of rape and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. The record shows that when the charge was read to the Appellant, he understood it and pleaded guilty after waiving his right to counsel. The facts were that on the 11th of August 2004, the Appellant was drinking with the complainant, her sister and her sister’s husband at a night club in Suva. She fell asleep in a hotel room. The Appellant entered the room and had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. When she resisted, he threatened to remove the gold denture recently fitted in her mouth. The complainant’s brother-in-law then entered the room and found the Appellant having sexual intercourse with the complainant. He chased the Appellant away. The matter was reported to police, and the Appellant was charged. The complainant was medically examined and found to have bruises on her neck.

The Appellant disputed one previous conviction in 1999 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In mitigation he expressed remorse. His aunt mitigated on his behalf, saying that he had had problems since his youth, that he had drunk heavily on the night in question, and that he was very sorry for what had happened.

The learned Magistrate started at 7 years imprisonment and gave him two years discount for the guilty plea and other mitigation. He sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment. The appellant now appeals against conviction and sentence. His original grounds of appeal were against sentence only. He was then unrepresented. He later was granted legal aid, and then filed amended grounds of appeal which also challenged his conviction. His grounds of appeal were as follows:

“2.1 That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he failed to consider before and while sentencing that the accused was unrepresented.

2.2 That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he failed to advice the accused of his constitutional right, the right to be legally represented by counsel of his choice or a council provided by Legal Aid Commission.

2.3 That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he failed to properly assess evidence tendered in court by witness and also the summary of fact.

2.4 That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he failed to properly assessed and consider the medical evidence in respect of the accused state of mind that was provided by witness.

2.5 That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact when he did not take into consideration that the evidence tendered in court was uncorroborated.

2.6 That the sentence is harsh and excessive.

At the hearing of this appeal, counsel proceeded substantially on ground 2.4, that is that the Appellant’s state of mind suggested a mental illness which ought to have been considered before plea was taken. There was nothing specific on the court record to suggest that the Appellant was mentally ill. However, I granted leave to the Appellant to adduce further evidence in the form of a psychiatric report. State counsel did not object.

On the 31st of March 2005, the Principal medical Officer at the St. Giles Hospital provided a medical report on the Appellant. She traced the Appellant’s history from birth including his slow development as a child and head injuries sustained in 2001 in a motor vehicle accident. The psychiatrist concluded after tests that:

“A mini-mental state examination conducted on Mr. Nadakuitamana rendered a score of 19/30. A score less than 23 is indicative of cognitive impairment. From the history provided by his mother and Mr. Nadakuitamana’s presentation during his admissions, it appears that he has some degree of mental retardation and has developed personality and behavioral changes in addition to further cognitive impairment secondary to the head injury. In my opinion, as a result of his mental disabilities, Mr. Nadakuitamana will not be able to properly follow or withstand the rigors of legal proceedings and is not fit to plead.”

In the light of this report, it is not necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. State counsel agrees that the plea is invalid and that the entire proceedings must be quashed.

Indeed if the learned Magistrate’s attention had been drawn to the Appellant’s mental condition, he himself would have called for, and received this report. He too would have concluded that the Appellant could not plead or be sentenced because of his inability to follow the court proceedings.

In the circumstances, the Appellant’s plea in the lower court is invalid, and must be quashed, together with his conviction and sentence.

Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code allows the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate powers to “make such other order in the matter as to it may seem just, and may by such order exercise any power which the magistrates’ court might have exercised.”

Section 148 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides:

“(1) When, in the course of a trial or preliminary inquiry or at any time after a formal charge has been presented or drawn up, the court has reason to believe that the accused may be of unsound mind so as to be incapable of making his defence, it shall inquire into the fact of such unsoundness and may adjourn the case under the provisions of section 202 for the purposes of obtaining a medical report and of making such other enquiries as it shall deem to be necessary.

(2) If the court is of opinion that the accused is of unsound mind so that he is incapable of making his defence, it shall postpone further proceedings in the case and shall report the case to the Governor-General.

(3) If the case is one in which bail may be taken, the court may release the accused person on sufficient security being given that he will be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person, and for his appearance before the court or such officer as the court may appoint in that behalf.

(4) Upon consideration of the court record the Governor-General may order that the accused may be confined in a mental hospital or other suitable place of custody and the court shall issue a warrant in accordance with such order. Any such order of the Governor-General shall be sufficient authority for the detention of such accused person until the Governor-General shall make a further order in the matter or until the court finding him incapable of making his defence shall order him to be brought it again in the manner provided by sections 151 and 152.”

In accordance with this section, and because I have reason to believe that the Appellant is incapable of making his defence, I postpone further proceedings in the case to make a report to the His Excellency the President. In making the report, I will refer to the additional evidence I heard from the Appellant’s mother, Katarina Rarasea of Narikoso, Ono, Kadavu. She has expressed her willingness to take responsibility for her son when and if he is released from custody. She said that the Appellant, whilst resident in Kadavu, fishes and farms, and gives no trouble to anyone. His anti-social behaviour only manifests itself when he has access to alcohol, and when he comes to Suva. She said that the turaga-ni-koro for their community, one Ratu Jale Sarasao would also take responsibility for the Appellant if ordered by the court of His Excellency the President. She also mentioned her cousin Marasiale Bole, who would also take care of the Appellant if she herself had to come to Suva for medical purposes.

Clearly, the St. Giles Hospital is not the appropriate place for the Appellant, and indeed the psychiatrist does not suggest that he should be kept in custody there. However I am concerned about the Appellant’s propensity to violence, and of the need to protect the community from such characteristics. There are no easy answers in Fiji, for the care of the mentally ill or the mentally retarded.

In the circumstances of this case I propose to recommend to His Excellency that the Appellant be kept until further order of the Court or of the President, in the custody of his mother Katarina Rarasea, his cousin Marasiale Bole and the turaga-in-koro of the village, Ratu Jale Sarasao. A condition of the order should be that the Appellant should not be permitted to leave Kadavu unless summoned by the court.

Whilst waiting for an order from His Excellency the appellant should not be further remanded. Prison is not an appropriate place for the mentally retarded. I therefore grant him bail on condition that he returns forthwith to Kadavu with his mother. Surety in the form of his mother is acceptable. He may not leave Kadavu and must remain at the home of his mother at Narikoso, Ono, Kadavu.

This appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentence are quashed.

78,806,81059,"SENTENCE

[1] This accused was charged with two representative counts of rape, one under the Penal Code and another under the Crimes Decree. The charges read as follows:

COUNT 1
Statement of Offence
RAPE: Contrary to Sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence
ABDUL RASHEED s/o Abdul Rahiman, between the 1st day of February, 2005 and the 31st day of December, 2005 at Nasinu in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl, namely ARTIKA SONAM SINGH, without her consent.

COUNT 2
Statement of Offence
RAPE: Contrary to Sections 207(1)(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
ABDUL RASHEED s/o Abdul Rahiman, on the 20th day of March 2011 at Nasinu in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl, namely ARTIKA SONAM SINGH, without her consent.

[2] After trial the three assessors returned unanimous opinions of guilty on both counts. The Court agreed and he was convicted on both counts.

[3] The facts of the case are that the accused was introduced to the girl's family by another as someone who could help the girl's mother cure her back and leg which had been causing her chronic pain. The accused claimed to have extraordinary powers of healing and demanded money from the family to buy a tanoa, a tabua and masi. They never saw these purchases because the accused said if they saw them they would go blind. He was able to heal the mother's leg in a week but her back was still paining. The accused continued to take money from the father and performed witchcraft on the ailing mother, even to the extent of ""extracting"" a piece of chicken from her stomach, by trickery. The family were convinced of his witchcraft powers.

[4] At one time he said that he could tell that someone had put a curse on the daughter of the family, Artika, who is the victim of these two charges. He said he could tell that someone had put something bad into her food at school and that her stomach was full of worms. He asked her father if he could heal her, and the father trusting him, agreed. The accused then told the parents to go, taking their young son with them. He told them to go to Suva Point and to light 14 cigarettes one by one and then come back. When they went away, the victim said that the accused appeared to be possessed by an evil spirit. He took her clothes off, pushed her on the floor and raped her. He continued to do that week by week from 2005 to 2011, usually at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning and every time sending the other family members to Suva Point to light cigarettes, thereby taking time. Sometimes the accused would hit the victim on the legs.

[5] The last time there was any sexual contact between the two was on the 20th March 2011 when after he had sent the others to Suva Point to light the cigarettes, he grabbed the girl, pushed her on the floor and using a broken glass cut her on the legs. He than raped her. By this time the girl had had enough and when her mother returned she told her about it and a report was made to the Police.

[6] At the end of the trial and before the summing up to the assessors, the accused absconded. He was not able to instruct his counsel to mitigate the penalty for the two rapes. By choosing not to be present, he thereby waives his right to mitigate.

[7] The papers on file disclose that he is 48 years old. He is living in a de facto relationship and has a small business dealing in bottles and scrap metal.

[8] The maximum penalty for rape under both the Penal Code and the Crimes Decree is life imprisonment. The authorities dictate that rape of an adult must attract an immediate term of imprisonment of seven years, and rape of a child must attract a term of at least ten years. To be raped by somebody in a position of trust is highly aggravating.

[9] In recent months, the community has become particularly aware of and censorious of the growing prevalence of rape, particularly rapes of children as young as nine months. Whilst the community, led by women's rights groups and concerned religious bodies, debates ways and means of reducing the incidence of such repugnant conduct, it is for the Courts in sentencing for this crime to show the community that crime of this nature will not go unpunished and heavy sentences will be meted out in an attempt to deter would be sexual abusers.

[10] The two counts that the accused has been convicted of are representative counts of a series of rapes between 9 February 2005 and 20 March 2011. The accused can be sentenced only for the two counts he has been convicted of, and not the uncharged rapes; however the prolonged pattern of rapes is certainly yet another aggravating feature.

[11] As the Court has said in para 6 hereof, there is nothing to be advanced in favour of the accused in mitigation. The highly aggravating features pertaining to the offences are these:

(1) The rapes were effected by the use of witchcraft and fraud.

(2) There was a prolonged pattern of rape over 6 years.

(3) The accused has demonstrated no remorse whatsoever.

(4) He sent the other family members away on a pointless task to give himself time to commit the offences.

(5) He used violence on the girl with broken glass on at least one occasion.
[12] On the 9th February 2005, the victim was but a child of 13 years. For that rape, I take a starting point of ten years imprisonment and for the highly aggravating features, I add six years imprisonment, making a total term of imprisonment of sixteen years.

[13] The second rape he has been convicted of was committed when the girl was 19 years old. I take a starting point of seven years and add the same period of six years for the same serious aggravating features making a total sentence of thirteen years. I order that this term be served concurrently with the term of sixteen years for the first rape.

[14] The sentence will commence from the date that the accused is apprehended and he will serve a minimum term of fourteen years before being eligible for parole.

79,807,71625,"DECISION

[1]. On 9 February 2011 the Appellant was convicted on one count of rape contrary to section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The Appellant had pleaded not guilty. On 10 February 2011 the Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole term of 4 years. The sentence took effect from 10 February 2011.

[2]. The Appellant filed his notice of appeal on 4 March 2011. The appeal was filed within the time prescribed by section 26 of the Court of Appeal Act Cap 12. An amended notice of appeal was filed on 9 May 2011. The amended notice sets out six grounds of appeal, all of which relate to the application for leave to appeal against conviction. However the amended notice also states that the appeal is against both conviction and sentence. In the initial notice the Appellant referred to the sentence as being ""excessively harsh sentence."" The application for leave to appeal against sentence will be considered on that basis.

[3]. A brief summary of the relevant facts was set out in the Sentencing decision of the learned trial judge. On 17 July 2010 the victim joined the company of the offenders (the Appellant being one of two) and a girl for a drinking party after a wedding ceremony in the village. The victim was 19 years old. The victim and the offenders all lived on Kioa Island. After consuming a substantial amount of liquor the victim passed out. The Appellant undressed the victim and raped her while she lay unconscious. This was witnessed by the girl who was in their company. She was threatened by the Appellant when she caught him having sexual intercourse with the victim who was still passed out.

[4]. Both parties filed written submissions. Counsel for the Appellant filed on 14 September 2012 submissions that addressed the grounds of appeal set out in the amended notice of appeal. Counsel for the Respondent on 31 August 2012 filed submissions that addressed the grounds of appeal set out in the Appellant's initial notice of appeal. Counsel presented further oral submissions on 17 September 2012. The written and oral submissions by both parties will be considered in the context of the amended grounds of appeal.

[5]. The amended grounds of appeal relied upon by the Appellant are:

""1 THAT the learned trial judge failed to give a balanced summing up that resulted in the convicted to be unsafe and unsatisfactory; and

2 THAT the learned trial judge failed to properly direct himself and direct assessors according to law when the assessors gave inconsistent verdict concerning a case largely built on the states of mind and that under all the circumstances of the case, the finding of guilt was unsafe and unsatisfactory; and

3 THAT the learned trial judge failed to direct assessors on the absence of professional and forensic material/ evidence on the effect alcohol consumption such as in this case, the real and practical effect of a 40oz bottle of Rum to the mind and body of people who consumed it.

4 THAT the learned trial judge failed to direct assessors to consider the timing of consumption of alcohol without a mix but dry, and the lighting effect in a close learn-to house in the afternoon by witness against the Appellant and that such non direction placed the Appellant to disadvantage and that the verdict was therefore unsafe; and

5 THAT the learned judge placed undue emphasis and weight in summing up to the evidence by complainant who said she could not remember anything and evidence of Elenoa Damudamu who was drunk and gave evidence of what she saw against the Appellant and failed to draw any evidential reference of how that exercise would have impacted the prosecution's case; and

6 THAT the learned judge failed to properly direct himself and the assessors in law and in fact on the issue of ""black out"" and ""unconscious"" after or during the consumption of alcohol that would have impact evidence against the Appellant.""

[6]. The first ground is a claim that the learned Judge did not give a balanced Summing Up thus resulting in an unsafe and unsatisfactory conviction. It is only necessary to make two comments on this ground. First, the ground of appeal is not sufficiently particularised to enable a proper examination of the claim. Secondly, that a conviction is unsafe or unsatisfactory is not a basis upon which the Court of Appeal should allow an appeal against conviction under section 23 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act. So far as relevant section 23 (1) state:

""The Court of Appeal on any such appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that the judgment of the Court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""

[7]. This ground of appeal does not raise an arguable point and leave is refused.

[8]. The second ground of appeal appears to relate to an assertion that the assessors gave inconsistent verdicts and that the finding of guilt was unsafe and unsatisfactory. This ground is not addressed in the Appellant's submissions. There is no indication as to what the assessors inconsistent verdicts were and the ground is not supported by any material that appears in the file. Leave is refused.

[9]. The third ground in effect relates to the issue of intoxication. There is no suggestion in the material that the Appellant had raised a defence of intoxication that prevented him from either forming the necessary intention or performing the act of intercourse. His defence was simply that he did not have intercourse not that he could not remember having intercourse with the complainant. This ground does not raise an arguable point and leave is refused.

[10]. The fourth, fifth and sixth grounds seeks to challenge the evidence upon which the prosecution relied and which the assessors must have accepted in order to reach a guilty opinion. In my judgment the Summing Up reasonably and fairly discussed the evidence given by the Appellant and adduced by the Respondent. The fact that the assessors preferred the sworn testimony of the witness who saw the offence being committed in preference to the evidence given by the Appellant is, under those circumstances, not a basis for claiming that the verdict should be regarded as unreasonable. It was a trial where the Appellant was represented by Counsel and where the evidence of the witness was tested under cross-examination. In my judgment all three grounds fail to raise an arguable point and leave is refused.

[11]. The application for leave to appeal against sentence is on even less secure ground. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment. The learned judge correctly identified seven years imprisonment as the appropriate starting point for the rape of an adult. The aggravating factors were identified by the learned judge for which a further year was added to the sentence. The mitigating factors being his good character and young age were considered and a deduction of two years was allowed. There is no error of law and the sentence is not wrong in principle. Leave to appeal against sentence is dismissed under section 35 (2) of the Act.

[12]. In summary, leave to appeal against conviction is refused under section 35 (3) of the Act and the appeal against conviction is dismissed under section 35 (2) of the Act.

AVINESH KUMAR between the 1st day of December 2014 and the 31st day of December 2014, at Sawani, Nausori, in the Central Division, had carnal knowledge of ‘A.D.’ without her consent.
 
  
• The brief facts were as follows. The complainant was below 16 years of age in year 2014. As her father was sentenced to jail, she was staying at her uncle Shailendra’s (2nd accused) house who was her mother’s brother. 1st accused is her aunt’s husband. 4th accused is complainant’s cousin and her mother’s 1st husband’s son. 1st accused and 3rd accused are brothers. When the complainant was staying at the 2nd accused’s house, all accused persons raped the complainant in 2014 on different occasions.
 
 
• The complainant had then run away from 2nd accused’s house to one of her school friends. Although she told her mother several times about what happened to her, her mother had told her not to report to the police as the accused persons would go to jail. Finally the complainant had told her father and on her father’s instructions she had reported the matter to the police.
 
 
• Maximum punishment for Rape is imprisonment for life. The tariff for rape of a child under 18 years of age is 10 – 16 years imprisonment. (Raj v. State FJCA AAU 0038.2010 (5 March 2014).
 
 
• In this case the complainant was raped by her own connected family members. In Drotini v. State [2006] FJCA 26, the Court of Appeal observed thus;
 

“There are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust. The seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family. If the child then remains in the family home, the rapist often has the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family.”
 
 
This observation was reemphasised by the Court of Appeal in Raj v State [2014] FJCA 18.
 
  
• 1st accused Navindra Prasad;

The aggravating factors are, that the 1st accused is an uncle of the complainant. He breached the trust reposed on him by the complainant. Complainant was in a destitute situation as her father was in jail and when she had to be looked after by her relatives from her mother’s side. Breach of trust in this case is a special aggravating factor. 
 
  
• Accused used his authority and the complainant’s vulnerability to commit the crime. You were 38 years old and the complainant was 15 years old when you committed the offence on her.
 
 
• Mitigating factors are, that you were a first offender, and you are the sole breadwinner of the family. Your 68 years old mother stays with you. Your wife had undergone a minor surgery.
 
 
• For the 1st accused Navindra Prasad, I take 13 years as the starting point. I add 3 years for your aggravating factors and deduct 2 years for your mitigating factors. Now your sentence is 14 years imprisonment. You have been in custody from the 2nd February 2016 to-date. Therefore I deduct 6 months for your period in custody.
 
 
• Now your final sentence is 13 years and 6 months imprisonment. Your non-parole period will be 12 years.
 
 
• 2nd accused Shailendra Singh; 

You are the uncle (mother’s brother) of the victim and you were also the guardian of the complainant as she was staying with you in your house. 
 
  
• You were 41 years old and the victim was 15 years old at the time of the offence. Apart from the above, the aggravating factors will be the same as for the 1st accused. 
 
 
• Your mitigating factors are that you have 2 daughters aged 12 years and 11 years. You are the sole breadwinner of the family and your wife has passed away. You are a first offender.
 
 
• For you the 2nd accused, I take 13 years as the starting point. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors and deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors.
 
 
• Now your sentence is 14 years imprisonment. You have been in custody since 02/02/2016 till 20/04/2016, for 2 ½ months. I deduct further 3 months for your period in custody and now your sentence is 13 years and 9 months imprisonment. Your non-parole period will be 12 years.
 
 
• 3rd accused Ravind Prasad;

You were 37 years old and the complainant was 15 years old at the time of the offence. Other than this, your aggravating factors are the same as for the 1st accused as mentioned above. 
 
  
• Your mitigating factors are that you are a first offender, you have 2 children and you are the sole breadwinner of the family.
 
 
• I take 13 years as the starting point and add 3 years for the aggravating factors. I deduct 2 years for the mitigating factors. Now your sentence is 14 years. You have been in custody for this case for 6 months. I deduct 6 months for your period in custody. Now your final sentence is 13 years and 6 months imprisonment. Your non-parole period will be 12 years.
 
 
• 4th accused Avinesh Kumar;

You are the cousin of the complainant and also the stepbrother. Other than this, the aggravating factors will be the same as for 1st accused.
 
  
• Your mitigating factors are that you are 23 years old and you are a first offender. Your father has passed away when you were very young. Your age will be taken into consideration. 
 
 
• I take 12 years as the starting point and add 3 years for the aggravating factors. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors. Now your sentence is 12 years imprisonment. I further deduct 6 months for your period in custody for this case. Now your sentence you have to serve is 11 years and 6 months. Your non-parole period will be 10 years.
 
 
• Your final sentence is:
 

For 1st accused – 13 years and 6 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 12 years.
 
For 2nd accused – 13 years and 9 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 12 years.
 
For 3rd accused – 13 years and 6 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 12 years.
 
For 4th accused – 11 years and 6 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 10 years.
