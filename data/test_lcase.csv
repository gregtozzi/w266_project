81372,judgment this is an appeal against conviction and sentence the appellant was charged with criminal trespass indecent assault and damaging property on the DATE he waived his right to counsel and pleaded guilty on all counts after they had been explained to him the facts were that on the DATE the appellant entered the house of one ilisoni lagi at lami village in the house was seventeen year old lusiana bola a form 5 student of wesley college she asked him to leave the house he held her neck dragged her into the bedroom and offered to have sexual intercourse with her when she refused he touched her breast she freed herself and ran out of the house the appellant then took a wooden stick beside the sitting room window and damaged the sewing machine belonging to the complainant s mother the complainant was alone in the house during the incident the appellant smelt of liquor he was later arrested and interviewed he admitted trespassing into the compound of ilisoni lagi and damaging the sewing machine however he said he could not recall the indecent assault as he was very drunk at the time the appellant admitted these facts and was convicted he was a first offender and a 28 year old labourer living in lami he asked for leniency saying that he was looking after his parents the sentencing remarks read as follows the court cannot pass a lenient sentence in this sort of circumstances count 1 sentenced to 3 months imprisonment count 2 sentenced to 1 year imprisonment count 3 sentenced to 2 years imprisonment the sentences were all to run concurrently with each other the grounds of appeal are that the appellant was wrongly convicted on the counts of trespass and indecent assault as he had not committed the offences and that the sentences were harsh and excessive in the light of the appellant s previous good record in his written submissions the appellant said that he committed the offences under the influence of alcohol and as a result of peer pressure he outlined his family circumstances saying that he was the sole breadwinner in his family with two sisters still at school state counsel opposed the appeal against conviction and said that because the sentences fell within their respective tariffs that a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment was not harsh or excessive i cannot agree it is correct that the record clearly shows unequivocal pleas of guilty from which there can be no appeal it is also correct that the sentences individually are not wrong in principle in that they fall within the tariffs for the offences however the sentence of 2 years imprisonment was harsh for damaging property when there was no evidence of the extent of the damage and when this was clearly not the worst type of offending for criminal damage further a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment for a 28 year old first offender is excessive and inappropriate the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender non custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment in this case i would maintain the sentence on count 2 of 12 months imprisonment although the victim was young and in her own home this was a case of fleeting indecency and not one warranting a longer sentence the tariff for indecent assault is 1 to 3 years imprisonment the sentence of 2 years on count 3 is however clearly excessive it is reduced to 1 year and all sentences must be served concurrently with each other the sentence on count 1 remains the same the total term of 12 months imprisonment is to be suspended for a period of 12 months the period of suspension to run from the DATE to account for the period already served this appeal is allowed nazhat shameem judge at suva DATE paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,1,699

age contrary to section 155 1 and 3 of the penal code 2 on DATE the appellant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently with each other 3 the appellant now appeals against sentence 4 at the hearing of this appeal the following issues were considered i time of presentation of the petition to the sigatoka magistrates court and ii if the appellant wanted to appeal against conviction as well time for presenting the petition 5 the court records show that the appellant who is unrepresented prepared his own petition his petition was prepared from prison and is dated DATE the petition was received by the sigatoka magistrates court on DATE that being 3 days outside of the 28 days for presentation prescribed by s 310 1 criminal procedure code 6 the position of appeals out of time was stated by the court of appeal in vimal construction joinery works limited others v vinod patel co ltd 2008 abu 0081 of 2006s where the court held at paragraph 15 in 2008 litigants should not assume that leave will be given to bring or maintain appeals or other applications where those appeals or applications are out of time unless there are clear and cogent reasons for doing so 7 this judgment was referred to again by the court of appeal in woodstock homes fiji ltd v sashi kant rajesh civil appeal no abu 0081 of 2006s where the court held at paragraph 65 however as held by this court in vimal construction joinery works limited others v vinod patel co ltd 2008 abu 0081 of 2006s litigants should assume that leave to bring or maintain appeals or other applications where those appeals or applications are out of time will not be given unless there are clear and cogent reasons for delay merit of an appeal or proceeding without more will rarely justify an extension of time except where the delay is minimal and no prejudice was occasioned by the delay 8 the applicant says that his appeal is against sentence only he does not wish to amend his petition and appeal against conviction as well 9 the applicant says that this appeal should be allowed for the following reasons 1 the delay in filing the petition was due to the prison authorities failing to ensure that his petition was presented on time 2 his sentence is too harsh given that the offences occurred in 2000 3 in 2006 he suffered from a spinal injury and 4 his grandson is presently being cared for by his son and daughter in law who both suffer from mental illness 9 the prosecution say that in this case a sentence of 2 years was lenient they say similar cases have attracted prison terms from 3 to 4 years 10 in his sentencing remarks the learned magistrate considered the case of state v roqica others criminal appeal no haa 037 of 2002 where shameem j refers to an earlier decision and states that sentence for the defilement of girls between the ages of 13 and 16 range from a suspended sentence for virtuous friendship offending to 3 to 4 years imprisonment where the offended is older and in a trusted position in relation to the victim 12 in this case the learned magistrate took 2 years of imprisonment as the starting point as there were 3 counts he then took into account the mitigation submitted by the appellants legal counsel and reduced the sentence by 6 months the learned magistrate held that the accused was not entitled to any further reduction as he did not plead guilty 13 the learned magistrate then gave due consideration to the following aggravating factors at the time of the offence the appellant was 40 years of age the complainant was just 12 years of age the appellant was in a relationship with her mother and they all lived in the same home given the complainants age she was entitled to treat the appellant as the trusted head of the family who could be called upon to provide protection and care 14 however the appellant was found to have prayed upon the complainant s vulnerability for these reasons the learned magistrate added 6 months to the sentence bring it to 2 years 15 the learned magistrate considered whether or not it was appropriate to suspend the sentence after considering the affect that these proceedings had had on the complainant and the offence itself the learned magistrate ordered that the sentence be immediate 16 the applicants petition was presented out of time the court of appeal has ruled that litigants should not assume that leave to bring or maintain appeals will be given unless there are clear and cogent reasons for delay i appreciate that while in prison the appellant must rely on the prison authorities to ensure that his petition was presented in time as the delay is minimal and the matter of presentation is out of the appellant s control i am willing to enlarge the period of limitation from 28 days to 31 days 17 having carefully considered the arguments presented by the appellant and the prosecution i find that the appeal against sentence is without merit i therefore dismiss the

80139,judgment 1 on the DATE in the nasinu magistrates court the respondent was convicted after trial of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the penal code chapter 17 laws of fiji he was sentenced on the DATE to 8 years imprisonment a sentence which was partially suspended in that he was to serve weekends in the prison and weekdays at large in the community there was no minimum term set before he was eligible for parole but a domestic violence restraining order with no contact and non molestations conditions was put in place 2 the state appeals the sentence on the grounds that a that the magistrate erred in law in imposing a partially suspended sentence and b that the magistrate failed to consider section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 in not imposing a non parole sentence 3 the unique and disturbing facts of the case were rather clumsily summarized by the learned magistrate as follows the accused and the complainant are related as biological brother and sister on the day in question that afternoon the victim was called by the accused to his home the accused was acquainted by their parents regarding some lesbian behavior and stealing of money he then questioned the victim regarding homosexual relationship lesbian with a lady and stealing of 600 money which she denied the accused was having party gathering and fully drunk at the moment the victim was then assaulted and questioned while in the process the victim urinated and passed feces sic because of fear and assaults she was 22 years at that time then on request of the accuseds wife the victim had a bath and cleaned herself and then she was taken into a room for counseling instead the accused ravished and raped her 4 this brief and unhappily worded synopsis of the facts although rather perturbing in itself does not disclose the true facts of the case according to the victim the accused told her that he would do something to her to make her forget she was a lesbian she attempted to run away from him but he chased her onto the road and caught her putting her in so much fear that it was then that she lost control of her bladder and bowels he kept her in a locked bedroom for about three hours while he subjected her to sexual indignities the accused confirmed the chase and the fact that she soiled herself but said he was too drunk to remember the rape he did remember having sex with somebody but could not remember who with at all times the accuseds wife was in an adjacent room 5 it is not for this court in this judgment to pass comment on those facts and they obviously speak for themselves 6 in his sentence the learned magistrate in referring to authorities which would suggest an appropriate sentence of 15 years for the crime quite properly found himself restricted to the magistrates courts maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and therefore took that figure as his starting point he added two years to this for aggravating features which he found to be i the complainant being his sister ii breach of trust between brother and sister iii the victim being severely assaulted 7 he reduced that 12 year interim sentence by 4 years for mitigating features which he found to be i first offender and ex special police inspector ii 33 years of age iii married with 4 children iv care giver of wifes 64 year old grandmother v matter hanging over his head for 5 years vi you suffered humiliation and mental agony vii you are totally remorseful of your actions viii you seek suspended sentence 8 these partially valid mitigating factors thus reduced the sentence to a term of 8 years which was the final sentence that the magistrate arrived at he then went on to consider whether he could suspend the sentence but quite properly found that by section 26 2 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 the decree he could not wholly suspend a sentence of more than two years his emphasis 9 the magistrate then went on to consider other options he thought available under that decree that would allow him to impose a lesser or alternative sentence pursuant to section 15 3 of the decree as well as to satisfy what he perceived to be the objective for first offenders to bend over backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders he adopted the words of the court of appeal in prasad aau0023 93 10 he concluded his sentence by stating that it is a sad and unfortunate incident but he was so foolish and no proper judgment could be taken at that time due to his anomalous mind before proceeding to pass the partially suspended sentence of weekend imprisonment 11 discussion this court will proceed to consider the propriety of the suspension of sentence as well as the lack of minimum term which are the grounds of appeal but will not comment on the final length of sentence for reasons soon to be apparent 12 section 26 of the decree reads as follows 26 1 on sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending for a period specified by the court the whole or part of the sentence if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances 2 a court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence a does not exceed 3 years in the case of the high court or b does not exceed 2 years in the case of the magistrates court 3 4 5 13 a sentence of 8 years clearly cannot be suspended because it exceeds the statutory maximum stipulated in subsection 2 b and the magistrate has not stated under what authority he has seen to partially suspend the sentence he states in his sentence that he cannot wholly suspend the sentence his emphasis leaving himself the option to partially suspend it but the section does not make this distinction the qualifying clause the whole or part of the sentence contained in 26 1 must logically follow through to subsection 2 14 i find that the magistrate had no power to partially suspend the sentence there being no provision in the decree for a sentence of more than 2 years to be suspended either in whole or in part the sentence of eight years must therefore be wholly served intra muros 15 the second ground of appeal relates to the failure of the magistrate to set a minimum term the state submitting that the imposition of a minimum term is mandated by the provisions of section 18 of the decree section 18 reads 18 1 subject to sub section 2 when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole 2 if a court considers that the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender make sic the fixing of a non parole period inappropriate the court may decline to fix a non parole period under sub section 1 3 4 5 6 7 16 again it is clear from the statutory provisions that although it is correct that a minimum term must be imposed there is a discretion for the sentencer not to do so the alternative is admittedly contradictory but it is within the sentencing tribunals powers when the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender are taken into account it is unfortunate that the magistrate did not state any reasons for not imposing a minimum term because it is not known if he was turning his mind to the offence or to the offender and it would have been far better had he done so but it is a discretion that an appellate court should not interfere with lightly 17 having said that i find that in declining to impose a minimum term under s 18 2 when mandated to do so by s 18 1 it must always be incumbent on the sentencer to provide reasons why he is doing so those reasons will either be the unusual nature of the offence or the special circumstances of the offender and nothing else failure to state the reasons will render the sentence invalid 18 the invalidity of the suspension restores the sentence of 8 years against this respondent and it is now for this court to set a minimum term the state has not appealed the length of the 8 year term but this court considers that in the unique and deplorable circumstances of this case the 8 year sentence is manifestly lenient and totally inadequate 19 the facts and circumstances of this case would warrant a sentence of at least 12 years imprisonment and probably more and the magistrate should have used his powers to transfer the accused to the high court for sentencing pursuant to section 190 of the criminal procedure decree the magistrate was well aware of the range of sentences this offence would attract when he referred to sentencing authorities at the beginning of his sentence when he did that it should have been quite apparent to him that the case was beyond the scope of his sentencing powers and transferred the case 20 section 256 3 of the criminal procedure decree gives this court the power to quash the sentence passed below and pass another sentence in substitution for the sentence as it thinks ought to have been passed but that restricts this appellate court to a maximum sentence of 10 years which is the maximum sentence the magistrate could have passed 21 this court is of the view that 10 years is still too lenient a sentence for the crime in the circumstances and would therefore adopt the following course this court sets aside the sentence passed below and by the terms of s 256 2 e of the criminal procedure decree sends the case up to the high court for sentencing which is a procedure the magistrate should have done at the time 22 the states appeal against sentence is allowed and i make the following orders 1 the sentence passed below is quashed pursuant to section 256 2 a of the criminal procedure decree 2 the accused is sent to the high court for sentencing pursuant to section 190 1 of that decree 3 a copy of this judgment will be sent to the chief registrar of the high court to satisfy the requirement of s 190 2 of that decree 4 the case will be called before me at 10am on DATE for

sentenced on the DATE to a 9 month sentence of imprisonment suspended for 3 years the director of public prosecutions appeals against this sentence on the grounds that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle and was manifestly lenient the charge was laid on the DATE the respondent pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody on DATE he changed his plea to one of guilty he was represented by counsel the facts were that on the DATE the victim was 5 years and 7 months old on that day she accompanied her uncle to visit neighbours to watch a video the respondent who is 30 years old was also there watching the video and drinking beer at 11 45pm the victim went outside to urinate the respondent followed her and took her into a tool room he turned off the outside light made the victim lie down touched her breasts pulled off her pants and rubbed his fingers over her vagina the victim s father and uncle started to look for her they checked the tool room and found it locked they then saw the accused running away from the tool room and found it locked they found the victim inside crying she told her uncle what had happened and the matter was reported to the police the victim was examined by a doctor who found a small abrasion on the hymen with minimal bleeding the history related to the doctor by the victim was that the respondent had forced her onto the bed in the tool room closed her mouth with one hand pulled her shorts down and took off his own shorts he then punched her on the stomach thigh and chest and penetrated her vagina with two fingers he fondled her private parts and kissed her the respondent admitted the offence when he was interviewed by the police he admitted the facts outlined in court the record shows that he read the medical report as did counsel in mitigation counsel submitted that he had not intended to commit the offence but had followed her to check she had completed urination she said that he was married with two daughters and expressed remorse he had one previous conviction in 1991 but was treated as a first offender the learned magistrate then made the following sentencing remarks accused is a first offender he has pleaded guilty in the first instance he appears remorseful he was remanded in custody pending sentence his term in remand will have been a lesson to him he has also assisted the court in pleading guilty in the first instance persuasive mitigation by counsel from legal aid has assisted the accused he is severely warned for the offence in consideration of the principles of sentencing including deterrence the accused is sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years with effect from today suspended sentence explained in his comprehensive and well researched submissions counsel for the state outlined the principles of sentencing in cases of the sexual assault of children he argued firstly that section 29 3 a of the penal code expressly provided that a sentence must not be suspended in cases of indecency towards children secondly he submitted the sentences for indecent assault in fiji ranged from 1 year to 4 years imprisonment and that relevant factors determining sentence were the age difference between offender and victim the penetrative nature of the assault and any betrayal of trust he suggested that a 3 year sentence would reflect the nature of the offending in this case the respondent asked for his non custodial sentence to remain saying that a custodial sentence will result in hardship for his family the suspended sentence section 29 3 of the penal code provides a court which passes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of not more than six months in respect of one offence shall not make an order under the provisions of subsection 1 where a the act or any of the acts constituting that offence consisted of an assault on or threat of violence to another person or having or possessing a firearm an imitation firearm an explosive or an offensive weapon or of indecent conduct with or towards a person under the age of sixteen years this subsection appears to apply to prevent the suspension of a sentence where the sentence of imprisonment is for less than 6 months and the offence committed is one of indecency to children fatiaki j in dpp v saviriano radovu crim app no haa0006 of 1996 considered this provision in an appeal by the state against a suspended sentence imposed for the indecent assault of an 8 year old child in that case the sentence imposed was 9 years imprisonment suspended for 18 months and a fine of 30 00 his lordship held that whilst it appeared that the limitation to section 29 applied only to sentences below 6 months imprisonment i cannot accept that in expressly excluding such acts from the operation of subsection 1 of section 29 the legislature was concerned only with the length of sentence imposed and not with the nature or type of offence committed quite plainly it was if this were not so one would have the rather extraordinary situation where serious offending such as attempted armed robbery where a prison sentence under 2 years was imposed could technically be suspended whereas a misdemeanour of being in possession of an offensive weapon in a public place could not be suspended if the trial magistrate imposed a sentence of less than 6 months further at page 7 he pointed out that the entire purpose of the limitations imposed by section 29 3 a could be circumvented by imposing a sentence longer than 6 months in order to suspend it he held that the whole of section 29 must be read together and that a court was therefore prevented from suspending the sentence of any offender convicted of the offences set out therein irrespective of the length of the sentence on a careful reading of section 29 1 a of the code the reference to sentences of less than 6 months imprisonment is difficult to understand further whilst section 39 of the criminal justice act 1967 u k had a similar provision although as fatiaki j said in saviriano radovu supra with quite a different effect its successor the powers of criminal courts act 1973 u k has no such limitation further section 118 of the powers of criminal courts sentencing act 2000 provides as follows 4 a court shall not deal with an offender by means of a suspended sentence unless it is of the opinion a that the case is one in which a sentence of imprisonment would have been appropriate even without the power to suspend the sentence and b that the exercise of that power can be justified by the exceptional circumstances of the case the courts have interpreted the phrase exceptional circumstances strictly r v robinson 14 cr app r s 559 a g s reference no 5 of 993 r v hartland 15 cr app r s 201 and there can be no doubt that the general limitation of the statutory availability of the suspended sentence originated from public dissatisfaction with perceived over use of the suspended sentence with respect such a general limitation on section 29 of the penal code would be far more useful then the ambiguous and anomalous provisions of section 29 3 a for the purposes of this appeal i find that the purpose of the sub section is to limit the use of suspended sentences in cases of inter alia offences of indecency against children and that to that extent the suspended sentence imposed in this case although it exceeded 6 months in length offended that purpose sentencing principles generally even in the absence of section 29 3 a however the sentence was wrong in principle there are now many decisions of the high court and court of appeal which have allowed for the setting of a tariff for indecent assault cases sentences range from 1 year to 4 years and where the victim is a child the starting point is 3 years imprisonment i upheld that starting point in apisai bavadra v the state crim app no haa0006 of 2003s in that case a 45 year old man rubbed his fingers over the vagina of a 9 year old child a sentence of 2 years imprisonment was imposed and upheld in robin abhinesh lal v the state crim app no haa0029 of 1998 surman j upheld a sentence of 18 months imprisonment imposed for the rubbing of the victim s vagina with the offender s penis the victim was 3 years old the offender was 18 in mark mutch v state crim app no aau0060 1999 sentences of 4 years imprisonment each on separate counts of indecent assault which involved the fondling of breasts and the inserting of fingers into the vagina of the victims were upheld by the court of appeal as i said in ratu penioni rakota v the state crim app no haa0068 of 2002 aggravating factors in the indecent assault of children include the nature of the assault whether violence was used whether weapons were used the length of time over which the assaults took place the betrayal of the child s trust in a family member or friend and a large disparity in age between victim and offender mitigating factors include a plea of guilty previous good character and remorse in this case the respondent was rightly treated as a first offender and credit was given for the guilty plea however the aggravating circumstances were the assaults on the victim the penetration of her vagina with two fingers and the age of the child compared with the age of the respondent with a starting point of 3 years imprisonment reduction for the mitigation and an increase for the aggravating factors i arrive at a sentence of 3 years imprisonment the suspended sentence was therefore wrong in principle and manifestly lenient conclusion this appeal is allowed the respondent is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to commence today nazhat shameem judge at suva DATE paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,1,1773
70320,sentence 1 the accused stood charged for having committed the offence of rape on one bx on DATE after the trial that lasted for three days the assessors returned unanimous opinions of guilty against the accused i having considered the evidence and my summing up on law concurred with the opinions of the assessors and convicted the accused of the offence as charged under section 207 2 c of the crimes decree 44 of 2009 2 the charge was sequel to an act of penetration of the mouth of bx with the penis of the accused the accused who stays at home during daytime because of his security duty at night was fifty years of age 3 the victim on the other hand was only four years who had suffered a great loss with the untimely death of her father when she was only three months old and she became destitute as her mother too left her after some time from the death of the father since then the victim was under the care of her grandmother 4 the victim along with her grandmother came to reside in a village about a year back where the accused was only couple of doors away the victim with the other children of the neighbourhood used to play at the place of the accused and got familiar with him and his place of residence this familiarity could be seen as the victim admittedly called the accused babban dada or grandfather 5 on DATE the grandmother sent the victim to the accuseds place to bring back her shoes which was found lying at the rear of the house and waited for her return under a tree in her premises the victim after a while came to the grandmother and said that the accused did something upon enquiry the victim revealed that the accused undressed himself and removed her pyjama down rubbed his penis around her genitalia and put his penis into her mouth after the accused took his penis out she saw the accused piss ing on the bed meaning that the accused had ejaculated she saw the accused wiping out the substance which looked white in colour with a piece of cloth the accused thereafter told the victim not to reveal the incident to anyone 6 it is on the above facts that the accused stands convicted under section 207 2 c of the crimes decree 2009 which expanded the traditional scope of the offence of rape to include inter alia the instances of penetration of the mouth of a victim without the consent in this case as provided for under section 207 3 of the decree and as admitted by the accused consent became immaterial as the victim bx was only four years of age and incapable of giving consent 7 the offence of rape is very serious in that it is triable only by the high court which attracts the punishment of life imprisonment under section 207 1 of the decree in addition to the severity that could be gauged with reference to the sentence sexual offences by their very constitution are serious in nature because law recognises no exculpatory or mitigatory defences courts time and again have emphasized the requirement of deterrence in imposing sentences on convicts for rape of children 8 accordingly the range of sentence for rape of children has been set between 10 15 years by sentencing guidelines madigan j commenced his starting point of sentence at 12 years to punish a rape convict where the victim was a fourteen year old step daughter and imposed a term of 13 years with a non parole period of 10 years state v mario tauvoli hac 027 2011 9 justice priyantha fernando in state v anand abhay raj hac 09 2010 applied a similar range of sentence to deal with an offender who had raped a ten year old step daughter and picked up 12 years as the starting point to reach a sentence of 16 years with justice fernando who imposed a mandatory 12 year period of sentence in that case lent strength to the words of goundar j in state v av 2009 fjhc 24 concerning the offence of rape of children where it was held rape is the most serious form of sexual assault society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences 10 learned counsel for the state and for the accused accepted the above range of sentence for the rape of children they also addressed court on aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to assist court in regard to the imposition of an appropriate sentence on the accused i have considered their submissions very carefully in light of the provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree in determining the sentence 11 the victim in this case was only four years of age at the time of the incident she was just stepping into her formative ages and moving around playing the accused who was fifty had three grown up children two of them were married the accused had four grandchildren from the two married daughters out of whom two were in or about the same age as that of the victim there cannot be any doubt that the accused in the circumstances knew the value of children and that they needed protection and shelter from adults despite that the accused raped the little girl who was in the age group of his grandchildren to satisfy his unnatural lust 12 the accuseds engagement in the unilateral acts of sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent the accused nevertheless continued with the same as evidence unravelled until he reached the climax of ejaculation his moral culpability was manifested when he told the victim not to tell the incident with a view to conceal his dastardly act from the whole world and escape the long arm of the law 13 these kinds of immoral acts on a little girl in the calibre of bx are bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and assess this kind of depravity should be frowned upon to save little children for their own future and men of the accuseds calibre should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community in passing down the sentence in a case of this nature deterrence is therefore of paramount importance 14 i am in the circumstances inclined to pick up a starting point of 14 years for the sentence in this case to reflect that the victim is very small compared to those in the two cases referred to above i add four years for the considerations in paragraphs 10 and 11 above which i consider as seriously aggravating circumstances to enhance the sentence to reach 18 years 15 i do not see favourable circumstances to mitigate the sentence apart from the fact that the accused is a first offender although the offence for which he is convicted now is so serious that his previous good behaviour should not have earned him a discount i nevertheless decide to reduce his sentence by 15 months the accused had been on remand nearly for nine months which should be deducted from his sentence i in the result arrive at a term of 16 year imprisonment 16 the accused has not shown any remorse or repentance on the contrary he relentlessly castigated the grandmother saying that she was making up a false allegation at the expense of the little girl to get rid of him of his land without any evidence to found such a serious allegation this added in my view insult to the injury while the court recognises that the accused was entitled to advance any proposition to advance his case court equally recognises that it should show its displeasure by showing no mercy in the matter of sentence when such allegations are found to be totally ill founded as in this case the accused in his mitigation also did not rely on any other circumstance that led him to this unnatural lust 17 accordingly i will determine that a 16 year period of imprisonment on the accused is appropriate to meet the principles and objectives of the sentencing and penalties decree the final sentence therefore is 16 years of imprisonment 18 acting under section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree i order that the accused shall not be eligible for parole until he serves 14 years in imprisonment priyantha nawana judge high court lautoka DATE paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,0,1454
79082,judgment background 1 following a trial in suva magistrates court the appellant was convicted for rape and was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment he appeals against conviction and sentence the grounds of appeal in summary allege the following errors failure to direct on standard of proof conviction not supported by evidence lack of resistance lack of corroboration sentence is unlawful and wrong in principle facts 2 the complainant is a young woman in her early twenties she grew up in the same village as the appellant she has known the appellant from a young age the complainant was in a relationship with the appellant s nephew lasike who also resided in the same village lasike s home was a few meters away from the appellant s house 3 on DATE lasike and the complainant attended a fundraising together at a home in the village later in the night they walked to the roadside the complainant was drunk lasike left the complainant at the roadside and went to buy a cigarette from a shop the complainant said that while she was waiting at the roadside for her boyfriend to return from the shop she was forcefully taken underneath a nearby house by one jo waisuku and raped 4 when lasike returned he saw the complainant crying lasike took the complainant to the appellant s house but it was closed lasike knew the appellant and his wife were attending a function at his home he went home got the key to the house from the appellant s wife and returned to the complainant lasike took the complainant inside the appellant s house and after a conversation left her there and returned home to check if the function at his home was over lasike said the complainant closed the door when he left but he does not know whether the complainant locked it after 10 minutes lasike returned and found the complainant outside and the appellant and his wife inside their house lasike noticed injury on the complainant s face he took the complainant to her home and left her there 5 the complainant said she was raped by the appellant when she was lying down inside the appellant s bedroom after her boyfriend had left she said the appellant pulled her down from the bed on to the floor and had sexual intercourse with her she resisted but the appellant covered her mouth while the appellant was having sex his wife walked in and punched the complainant under cross examination the complainant said she recognized the appellant because she had seen him many times in the village she said although there was no light inside the bedroom she recognized the appellant s face and when his wife walked in she turned on the light and punched her when she saw the appellant on top of her 6 the appellant s caution interview was tendered without any objection the appellant said that when he and his wife returned to their home he saw the complainant lying in his bedroom he said he tried to wake her up and tell her to go home he denied raping her 7 the appellant s sworn evidence was consistent with his caution statements the appellant s wife gave evidence confirming the account given by him consideration of appeal grounds 8 the case against the appellant substantially depended on the complainant s evidence there was evidence that the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant and without her consent the learned magistrate directed herself that the prosecution carried the burden of proving the charge beyond reasonable doubt 9 when considering the complainant s evidence the learned magistrate directed her mind to the question of corroboration of her evidence being satisfied that the complainant was a reliable witness the learned magistrate found there was no need for corroboration the learned magistrate accepted the complainant as a truthful witness after warning herself about the requirement of corroboration in sexual cases 10 the learned magistrate dealt with the appellant and his wife s evidence and disbelieved them the learned magistrate said iowane sireli and his wife unaisi leweniqila according to their evidence entered the house together it s a one bedroom house according to the evidence iowane sireli went to wake nina whilst unaisi went to warm up the food it appears strange that unaisi did not show any curiosity as to who was lying on her bed and just continued with the warming of the food their evidence sounded very doubtful 11 the appellant contends that he cannot be convicted for rape unless corroboration is present there is no basis for the contention there is no statutory requirement for corroboration in cases of sexual offences the rule of practice that required a warning that it was dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant was reviewed by the court of appeal in the case of seremaia balelala v the state criminal appeal no aau0003 of 2004s the court declared that the rule of practice should only be applied if there was some particular aspect of the complainant s evidence that gave rise to a question as to its reliability 12 although the appellant challenged the complainant s identification of him the identification by the complainant was not a case of a fleeting glance the appellant was not a total stranger to the complainant she saw his face while he was on top of her which identification was later confirmed when the appellant s wife turned on the light and punched the complainant when she saw the appellant and the complainant together the evidence of the appellant s wife did not support the complainant s evidence but his the issue then was whether the appellant and his wife were telling the truth or whether the complainant was telling the truth 13 in this case there was no corroboration of the complainant s evidence and as i have said the law did not require corroboration the learned magistrate convicted the appellant after being satisfied that the complainant was a truthful witness i cannot see any error in the manner in which the learned magistrate assessed the complainant s credibility and her evidence the learned magistrate convicted the appellant after being satisfied of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt 14 in her sentencing remarks the learned magistrate said this must have been a horrific experience for the complainant first she was raped by a fellow village man and then when she took shelter at the appellant s home she was raped by the appellant who also was a fellow village man the learned magistrate considered the fact that the complainant grew in the same village and that the appellant knew her and had seen her growing up as an aggravating factor the mitigating factors were the appellant s previous good character and family circumstances the learned magistrate used a term of 7 years as a starting point after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors she imposed a term of 6 years imprisonment the sentence is neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive result 15 in the result all the

79717,sentence 1 you iowane valeuto are here to be sentenced on admission of guilt on your own accord for the following offence namely indecently assault contrary to section 154 1 c of the penal code there are two counts in this regard i am satisfied with your plea is unequivocal and that you understand the repercussion of your plea i am further satisfied the facts of this case present included and proved every elements of this offence 2 according to the facts which you have admitted between DATE t0 DATE you indecently assaulted sokoveti vaubula there were two incidents the first one was while 11 year old child victim was sleeping with her mother at that night you tried to pull down her pants and thereafter she kicked your head and managed to escape second incident was the serious incident the victim was alone with you and you forcefully undressed her victim was frightened and shivering then you began to lick her vagina and sucked her nipples then you took off your pants and put your penis on her vagina then you proceeded to slide your penis over victims vagina whilst sucking her nipples you did this few minutes and left the victim 3 maximum penalty could be imposed for this offence is 5 year imprisonment 4 tariffs vary the gravity and nature of these offences in rt penioni rokota v state haa 68 02s shameem j held that sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years the gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type aggravating factors of the offence 5 following facts were revealed by the summary of facts placed before the court and will be considered as aggravating factors serious breach of trust act against the societal religious and traditional rules took deliberate advantage of the victims naivety and trust lack of responsibility age gap with the victim the accused was 37 years and victim was 11 years mitigating factors 6 you are a first offender and have previous good character you said you are 38 years married with 3 children security guard by profession you earn 1 30 per week you said still you are a first offender and asked courts forgiveness and leniency in this case you ask non custodial sentence you said you are the sole bread winner of the family and ask second chance you said you are not living with the complainant and reconciled with complainant it is to be noted this is not a reconcilable charge but i note the victim has written two letters to the dpp and to the court stating that she desired to withdraw her complaint against the accused iowane valueuto this case has not decided on merits in that scenario the accused wished to plead guilty and asked non custodial sentence it is sure the accused act is against the society and it cannot be withdrawn by the victim it is not clear why the dpp had not taken the victims request as they normally act in other requests similar types of cases probably the gravity of the offence at the time of taking plea the counsel for the dpp was present but has not shown that they seek deterrent sentence in this matter but they filed sentencing submission indicating that they insist deterrent sentence it seems to me that state is expecting deterrent sentencing according to guideline judgements as they rely on this court admits that the behaviour of the accused cannot be condoned whatsoever but victim has chosen to withdraw her complaint if victim refused to give evidence in the trial what would be the outcome of this case off course she is a compellable witness but if she refused or lied to court what would be the situation this case is hanging over since 2007 in the light of these circumstances this court accepted the plea of guilty of the accused and indicated that non custodial sentence could be given if he pleads it is to be noted that plea bargaining by the court is permitted although sentence bargaining is not permitted by the parties in commonwealth and common law jurisdictions the trial judge has sole discretions to pass the sentence under attended circumstances see attorney general v j s uluwaduge 1995 1 sri lanka law reports 157 per justice d p s gunesekera in similar jurisdiction in attorney general v mendis 1995 1 sri lanka law reports 138 justice gunesekera articulated in sentencing the trial judge should not surrender his sacred right and duty to any other these principles and guidelines are persuasive to me 7 i select 2 years as the starting point you pleaded guilty for the charge without going to the trial therefore you are entitled for reduction of your sentence normally exercising courts discretion superior courts have followed 1 3 reduction for early plea as set out in veretariki vetaukula vs the state high court crim app case no haa057 07 followed in hem dutt vs the state fca crim

years and 6 months you saved courts time and resources despite pw1 has withdrawn the complainant two times you opted to plead guilty to the charge therefore i reduce 6 months your actual sentence is 2 years imprisonments 8 in this scenario as court indicated should i impose you a custodial sentence in this case or should i suspend it i note that you are a first offender i consider decided cases in this regard 9 in prasad v the state 1994 fjhc 132 haa0032j 94s DATE s w kepa j enunciated that the fact that appellants are first offenders ought to be a very strong mitigating factor in their favour a prison sentence ought to be the last resort after the court has explored and exhausted all other alternative sentences emphasize is mine 10 in prasad v state 1994 fjca 19 aau0023u 93s DATE fiji court of appeal held that courts ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders 11 it has been noted in prasad v the state 1994 fjhc 132 supra that criminologists recognise that a prison sentence should be the last resort especially where a first offender is concerned unless the charge is very serious or the offender is dangerous and imprisonment is called for in the public interest or in the interest of the offender himself emphasize is mine 12 singh v the state 2000 fjhc 115 haa0079j 2000s DATE shameem j went on saying however as a general rule leniency is shown to first offenders young offenders and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse i believe that in this case every effort should have been made to keep four of the appellants out of prison they were first offenders they were only 18 years old and they pleaded guilty on being brought to court although the 1st appellant was not 18 years old he was a first offender and this offence was clearly an aberration during what appears to be an otherwise blameless life 13 nariva v the state 2006 fjhc 6 haa0148j 2005s DATE shammem j again stressed the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender non custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment 14 you are not young but have a large family you are a first offender if you sentenced to prison term your

observed we consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 6 in endorsing the kasim case cited above the court of appeal in asaeli drotini no 1 of 2005 stated 15 the continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in the levels of sentences ordered in rape cases by

appellant was convicted accordingly of the above charges and was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment for the offence of burglary and 9 months imprisonment for indecent assault both sentences were to run concurrently however for the offence of escaping from lawful custody the court sentenced the appellant to 9 months imprisonment and the court decided that this sentence be served consecutively being dissatisfied with the decision of the magistrates court the appellant filed his amended grounds of appeal against sentence within time grounds of appeal in summary the appellant s grounds of appeal filed are as follows i that the learned sentencing magistrate erred in law in acting upon the wrong principle of sentencing ii that the learned sentencing magistrate erred in law by allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide him iii that the learned sentencing magistrate had mistook the facts iv that the learned sentencing magistrate failed to take into account some relevant considerations in support of these grounds the appellant filed handwritten submissions the respondent also filed submissions in reply the principal ground of appeal relates to the issue of sentencing in the magistracy facts admitted by the appellant accused and complainant were neighbors complainant was living with her husband and children on the day of incidence complainant was sleeping inside her house with her two daughters in the living room and her husband was sleeping in the bedroom with the 3 year old son the door was locked accused somehow managed to open the door and entered the house of complainant as accused entered the house the house was in dark so he used his gas lighter to see where complainant was sleeping accused saw complainant sleeping with her two daughters on the mattress on the floor then he sat beside complainant and slipped his hand inside complainant s under garment and started fondling with her vagina complainant woke up and was unable to see the face of accused because there was no light in the house she thought it was her husband and started calling her husband s name accused replied that it is me paula hearing this complainant screamed and from this her husband woke up when complainant s husband entered the living room he saw someone stepping outside the front door complainant s husband picked a stick and threw it and it hit accused s left ear whilst accused was running away from the light of house complainant s husband clearly recognized accused law relating to appeals against sentence the sentencing court should be guided by the proportionality principle enshrined in the constitution of the republic of fiji sentencing and penalties decree 2009 and guideline judgments if any in arriving at an appropriate sentence section 11 1 of the constitution provides every person has the right to freedom from torture of any kind whether physical mental or emotional and from cruel inhumane degrading or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment section 15 3 of the sentencing and penalties decree states as a general principle of sentencing a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4 and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this part an examination of fiji case law reveals that proportionality is the most fundamental principle of sentencing so far developed by the courts this principle seems not only to be a rule of law but also a constitutional imperative the selection of the particular punishment to be imposed on an individual offender is subject to the constitutional principle of proportionality a constitutional protection to exist in determining that the punishment must first be proportionate to the offence but also proportionate to the personal circumstances of the offender in essence this principle demands that a sentencing court should first locate the specific offence on the overall scale of gravity and then proceed to make any necessary allowance for relevant personal circumstances it is within this cardinal principle that criminal record must be assessed in affecting the quantum of punishment to be imposed on the offender this court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 and adopted in kim nam bae v the state criminal appeal no aau0015 at 2 in bae v state 1999 fjca 21 aau0015u 98s DATE the fiji appeal court observed it is well established law that before this court can disturb the sentence the appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion if the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if he mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some relevant consideration then the appellate court may impose a different sentence this error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 the supreme court in naisua v state 2013 fjsc 14 cav0010 2013 DATE endorsed the views expressed in bae supra it is clear that the court of appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 and adopted in kim nam bae v the state criminal appeal no aau0015 at 2 appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors i acted upon a wrong principle ii allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him iii mistook the facts iv failed to take into account some relevant consideration the fiji court of appeal in sharma v state unreported cr app no aau0065 of 20 DATE discussed approach to be taken when reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court the court observed in determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge the approach taken by this court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or in other words that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range it follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion this court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range however it must be recalled that the test is not whether the judges of this court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence it must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust having considered the aforementioned case law and sentencing principles i proceed to review the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate to see if it is harsh or excessive analysis grounds raised by the appellant are based on the premise that the sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principle therefore all the grounds can to be dealt with together learned sentencing magistrate at paragraph 9 of his ruling had correctly identified the maximum penalty for each offence according to section 312 1 of the crimes decree maximum sentence for burglary is 13 years imprisonment maximum sentence for the offence of indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment s 212 1 and for the offence of escaping from lawful custody the maximum sentence is 2 years imprisonment s 196 learned magistrate took the tariff for burglary as between 18 months and four years imprisonment in identifying the tariff for burglary the learned magistrate considered petero baleiwaiyevo v the state 2008 ham 002 08 a house breaking case decided under the repealed penal code at that time the maximum sentence for burglary was imprisonment for life and the tariff ranged from 18 months to 4 years after promulgation of the crimes decree the maximum sentence was reduced to 13 years imprisonment after analyzing series of authorities rajasinghe j in vuli v state 2017 fjhc 17 haa 53 2016 DATE concluded that the tariff for burglary under crimes decree should be between 1 and 3 year s imprisonment therefore learned sentencing magistrate fell into error when he considered petero baleiwaiyevo v the state 2008 ham 002 08 a house breaking case decided under the repealed penal code to identify the tariff for burglary as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff in koroivuki v state 2013 fjca 15 aau 0018 2010 DATE the court of appeal observed the following in respect of the starting point in selecting a starting point the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence no reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors the final term should fall within the tariff if the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range learned magistrate picked a starting point of 20 months for the first count of burglary from the upper range of tariff and did not take into account the good practice advocated in karoivuki supra he also failed to give any reason for selecting a higher starting point learned magistrate correctly identified the tariff for indecent assault as between 12 months and 4 years tariff for indecent assault was set out in rakota v state 2002 fjhc 168 haa0068j 2002s DATE shameem j observed sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years the gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence the indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence the nature of the assault whether it was penetrative whether gratuitous violence was used whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated all reflect on the gravity of the offence mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence these are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the penal code generally the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases a five year sentence may be appropriate a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar and the assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these the starting point selected for indecent assault was 12 months from the lower range of tariff and the final sentence 9 months imprisonment fell within the tariff in conformity with karoivuki supra principle there is no tariff set for escaping from lawful custody nine months imprisonment imposed on this count is not excessive having selected the starting point for each count learned magistrate went on to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances however he took elements of offences when he stated the aggravating factors are that for the unlawfully entered the complainant s house and disturbed the complainant from her sleep and created a perception of insecurity in the village he could better have taken night time invasion as an aggravating factor having adjusted the sentence for aggravating and mitigating factors learned magistrate imposed a final sentence of 16 months imprisonment for burglary count which fell within tariff final sentences imposed on indecent assault count and escaping from lawful custody count were also within permissible range therefore when taken individually sentence imposed on each count is neither hash nor excessive the appellant raised the issue in his submission that his sentence was harsh and excessive when it was made to run consecutively to the existing prison term however as per the court record no prison term was being served by the appellant at the time his sentence although he had pleaded guilty to the count of escaping from lawful custody on an earlier occasion therefore appellant was not a serving prisoner at the time of his sentence learned magistrate at paragraph 19 of his sentence remarked paula bete i have decided to have both sentence s to be served consecutively and therefore you are sentence d to 25 months imprisonment it appears that learned magistrate was dealing with two distinct cases namely cf 656 16 and cf 424 16 when he ordered the sentence imposed on escaping from lawful custody 9 months in cf 424 16 to be served consecutive to sentence imposed in cf 656 19 16 months section 22 of the sentencing and penalties act allows the court to order sentence to run consecutively or concurrently section provides as follows 1 subject to sub section 2 every term of imprisonment imposed on a person by a court must unless otherwise directed by the court be served concurrently with any uncompleted sentence or sentences of imprisonment 2 sub section 1 does not apply to a term of imprisonment imposed a in default of payment of a fine or sum of money b on a prisoner in respect of a prison offence or as a result of an escape from custody c on a habitual offender under part iii d on any person for an offence committed while released on parole or e on any person for an offence committed while released on bail in relation to another offence 3 4 every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of a prison offence or an escape offence must unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment 5 every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of an offence committed while released on parole in relation to another sentence of imprisonment imposed on that person must unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment which the offender may be required to serve in custody on cancellation of the parole order 6 every term of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner by a court in respect of an offence committed while released on bail in relation to any other offence must unless otherwise directed by the court based on exceptional circumstances be served consecutively on any uncompleted sentence of imprisonment this provision was discussed by the fiji court of appeal in vukitoga v state 2013 fjca 19 aau0049 2008 DATE which was referred to in dhirendra nandan v state ham 162 of 2014 the court held that a concurrent sentence should be imposed and that if the court intends to impose a consecutive sentence then the court must give a justifiable reason to do so in this case the learned magistrate imposed a consecutive sentence without giving any reason therefore the respondent concedes appellant s argument to be meritorious in view of section 22 4 of the sentencing and penalties act the learned magistrate would have been correct in ordering consecutive sentence even without giving any reason if the appellant was a serving prisoner having an uncompleted prison term at the time of sentence since the appellant was not serving at that time learned magistrate was required to give reasons for ordering a consecutive sentence instead of a concurrent sentence hence section 256 3 of the criminal procedure act warrants me to exercise powers to quash the order made by the learned magistrate at paragraph 19 of his sentence ruling that required appellant to serve 9 months consecutive to 16 months imprisonment imposed in cf 656 16 accordingly i quash the sentence of 25 months imprisonment and substitute a sentence of 16 months imprisonment the appellant was involved in a night time invasion and the assault was not of fleeting type therefore i do not order a suspended sentence final order sentence for burglary count is 16 months imprisonment sentence for indecent assault count is 9 months imprisonment sentence for escaping from lawful custody count is 9 months imprisonment all sentences to be served concurrently accordingly the appellant is sentenced to 16 months imprisonment

disfigurement or to any permanent or serious injury to any external or internal organ member or sense 9 view of this court is that the injuries of the victim do not cover under the above interpretation but it falls within the interpretation of bodily harm 10 at this point it is prudent to consider the legal interpretation of the term harm harm means any bodily hurt disease or disorder

northern division had unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman namely ashwani sashi naidu d o govind sami without her consent the appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of 5 years imprisonment on each count each of which to be served concurrently the appellant as far as the court can ascertain from both the letter of application and oral submission is appealing against both conviction and sentence the state as respondent has also counter appealed on the sentence upon the following grounds a the learned magistrate erred in law when he failed to apply the correct sentencing principles applicable in rape cases in particular the correct starting point enunciated by the high court b the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when he imposed a sentence that is manifestly lenient having regard to all the circumstances of the case in particular its aggravating features the appellant first appeared and pleaded not guilty in the labasa magistrates court on DATE the victim s evidence together with those of 3 prosecution witnesses had already been heard on DATE in the course of the hearing of the victim s mother s evidence the appellant changed his plea to guilty the court informed him of his rights and thereafter the trial proceeded which finally resulted in the conviction and sentence above the facts according to the record are as follows the victim s mother had moved with the victim and her younger sister and brother from wainikoro to vunika following the death of her husband the family initially stayed with the mother s younger sister where the appellant who is related to the younger sister s husband met and formed a close relationship with the victim s mother they in fact became lovers in the end the appellant and the victim s mother moved away together with the victim and her siblings tour for approximately 2 years the appellant lived as the head of the victim s household although the appellant s relationship with the victim s mother remained as one of common law husband and wife on DATE the first offence of rape took place on the day the appellant together with the victim s mother had taken the appellant s mother to the hospital and then later to the applicant s brother s house when the victim s mother stayed to look after the appellant s ailing mother the victim and her brother and sister stayed on their own in the house sharing a bedroom of 2 beds one was occupied by the victim and the other shared by her younger brother and sister at about 1 a m the applicant returned home and was let in by the victim who then went straight back to bed around 2 30 a m the victim was awoken by the appellant standing over her naked a knife in his hand he then with his other hand pressed his face closing his mouth stopping her from making any sound after threatening her with the knife if she objected or raised the alarm he dropped the knife and while still maintaining his right hand pressure on her mouth pulled her dress up and panties down with his free left hand the appellant then forcibly had sex with the victim the appellant afterwards threatened the victim with death should she tell anyone of the incident the second rape occurred on DATE the victim was alone at home when the appellant returned from soasoa the latter asked the victim for sex the victim refused and the appellant threatened with a knife and death reprisal should she reveal all before he again forcibly had sex with her appellant s appeal the appellant s appeal against conviction is premised on the ground that he was tricked into pleading guilty in exchange for a non custodial sentence according to the appellant the police confronted him during the court s adjournment on the second day of hearing and persuaded him to change his plea to guilty in return the appellant alleges the police were to secure a non custodial sentence instead of 9 years imprisonment if he was found guilty the appellant further states that he was easily converted because of the mental and emotional instability he was under at the trial in addition the appellant argues that sex with the victim was consensual and in support of this referred to a letter from the victim obtained by the appellant and which the appellant claims had been given to the labasa police station to be handed over to the court to prove his case as to the claim of the police ruse for the appellant to change his plea this court does not find any credible evidence for support such allegation the record of the proceedings show merely that the appellant had decided to change his plea soon after the mother of the victim began giving evidence thereafter the learned magistrate warned the appellant and specifically asked him whether there was any pressure exerted on him to change his plea the appellant according to the records stated that there was no pressure made on him and he wished to changed his plea to guilty on my own accord there cannot be any clearer evidence than this to show that the appellant had not been persuaded by another to change his plea the appellant s submission that he had produced to the police a written statement by the victim confirming that sex was consensual is also not proven neither was any reference made to it by the appellant himself in the course of the trial but even if there was such a statement the court would have been very wary of the victim s voluntariness to make it given the appellant s physical presence over her and the threats of bodily harm which he had made to her in the past finally the appellant makes the point that the victim did not report the rapes to the police until 3 weeks after the incidents this tends to support his argument that there was no rape only consensual sex however it is clear from the evidence of both the victim and her mother that the appellant had exerted power over them during and immediately after the offences were committed there were very little opportunities to let on to the authorities the terrifying ordeals the victim had undergone the appellant was always around the only when the victim s auntie called the police following the appellant s abuse of the victim and her mother did the opportunity present itself i am satisfied having reviewed the evidence that the learned magistrate had correctly convicted the appellant for the 2 counts of rape the appellant s appeal on sentence i will deal with together with the prosecution cross appeal below appeal on sentence both the appellant and prosecution appealed on the ground of sentence the appellant argues that the sentence of 5 years was excessive and amounted to a miscarriage of justice the prosecution for its part argued to the contrary namely that the sentence was manifestly lenient having regard to all the circumstances of the case and that the learned magistrate had failed to apply the correct sentencing principles applicable in all rape case first the prosecution submission that the learned magistrate failed to apply the correct sentencing principles it is clear from the record that the learned magistrate had paid particular attention to these not only did he refer to the high court decisions that provide him authority but abided by them the learned magistrate correctly stated that the starting tariff for similar offences was 7 years he then worked on the aggravating versus the mitigating factors reflecting in the upscaling and downsealing of the sentence in the end the learned magistrate concluded that 5 years was the appropriate tariff under the circumstances i do not see any merit in the prosecution s argument that the learned magistrate had failed to apply the correct sentencing principles similarly its arguments that the sentence was manifestly lenient having regards to all the circumstances of the case does not succeed the learned magistrate had taken on board all the relevant factors in favour and against the appellant and in the exercise of his discretions arrived at the final 5 years sentence the appellant s submission that the sentence was excessive is without merit if anything the learned magistrate had been almost lenient in the sentence given the nature of the offence and the relationship of the victim to the appellant i do not see any good reason to disturb the findings of the court below in the end the court finds no merit in both the appellant s appeal

250668,judgment introduction this is a timely appeal filed by the appellant against the conviction and sentence of the learned magistrate at lautoka the appellant was charged with one count of indecent assault contrary to section 212 1 of the crimes decree 2009 the trial magistrate found the appellant guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly on the DATE appellant was sentenced to a term of 18 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 months being dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the appellant filed a notice of appeal on the DATE with following grounds grounds of appeal that the learned magistrate erred in law when he failed to note down the summary of facts that he was guilty for in his sentencing remarks that the learned magistrate erred in that he took the starting point of 1 year without outlining the circumstances of the facts with which the appellant is charged and pleaded guilty with that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact when he enhanced 1 year as aggravating factor which does not constitute the offence without outlining the summary of facts this has caused a miscarriage of justice the learned sentencing magistrate erred in law and fact when he failed to give any reason why it took him 4 years to pass a custodial sentence rather than a suspended sentence since the sentence was below 2 years the learned sentencing magistrate erred in that he misguided himself with the guideline authority as paragraph 4 of his sentencing when he failed to highlight the facts of the case that the sentence of 18 months with non parole period of 12 months is harsh in all circumstances of the case the learned magistrate erred in law and principle when he failed to exercise discretion to guide himself with the sentencing and penalties decree the learned sentencing magistrate erred in law when he failed to exercise section 4 1 2 and 15 of the sentencing and penalties decree appellant in his written submission advanced the following grounds of appeal against conviction 1 offence not proved beyond reasonable doubt 2 conviction and sentence are null and void as the learned magistrate failed to conform to requirements set out in section 142 1 of the criminal procedure act law relating to appeals against conviction and sentence the law relating to appeals against conviction and sentence is set out in section 246 1 and 4 of the criminal procedure act 246 1 subject to any provision of this part to the contrary any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment sentence or order of a magistrates court in any criminal cause or trial to which he or she is a party may appeal to the high court against the judgment sentence or order of the magistrates court or both a judgment and sentence 4 an appeal to the high court may be on a matter of fact as well as on a matter of law this court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in house v the king 1936

that before this court can disturb the sentence the appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion if the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if he mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some relevant consideration then the appellate court may impose a different sentence this error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 the supreme court in naisua v state 2013 fjsc 14 cav0010 2013 DATE endorsed the views expressed in bae supra it is clear that the court of appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 and adopted in kim nam bae v the state criminal appeal no aau0015 at 2 appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors i acted upon a wrong principle ii allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him iii mistook the facts iv failed to take into account some relevant consideration the fiji court of appeal in sharma v state unreported cr app no aau0065 of 20 DATE discussed the approach to be taken by an appellate court when reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court the court observed in determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge the approach taken by this court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or in other words that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range it follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion this court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range however it must be recalled that the test is not whether the judges of this court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence it must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust factual matrix 11 the facts accepted by the trial magistrate are as follows complainant was renting a flat on ground floor belonging to accused s mother on DATE she was home and was near the washtub washing dishes facing washtub when the accused came behind accused touched her private part squeezed and held onto it she struggled hard to free herself with her only hand her other hand had been amputated after an accident the accused then threatened her and said if this matter leaks out i will chop your husband the accused then went upstairs complainant took her kids and went to town she did not report to police out of fear and waited her husband to return on the next day she went to the police station with her husband and reported the matter to police accused begged for reconciliation but she moved out of the flat after three days analysis appeal against conviction learned trial magistrate accepted the version of the prosecution and rejected that of the defence he had carefully analysed evidence of both sides and given reasons for his decision prosecution had called the complainant and the investigating officer as witnesses complainant s evidence is consistent and reliable she had made a prompt complaint to police and had relocated herself with her family due to fear of the accused complainant had made a prompt complaint to police on the following day the investigating officer pw2 who had recorded the statement of the complainant confirmed that she complainant was in a distressed condition when the statement was being recorded trial magistrate rejected evidence of the accused and his mother reasons given for rejection are well founded he had highlighted number of material contradictions between evidence of the accused and his mother accused admitted that he lied to police at the caution interview about his alibi trial magistrate found accused s caution statement inconsistent with evidence called for defence accused touched complainant s private part squeezed and held onto it she struggled hard to free herself with her only hand complainant s evidence which was acted upon by the trial magistrate proved the elements of indecent assault although he had failed to set out the elements of the offence specifically in the judgment defence failed to create any doubt in the prosecution case the trail magistrate s finding that prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable doubt is available in evidence trial magistrate had identified points of determination and given his finding on each point he had given reasons for his decision therefore there is no error on the part of the magistrate two grounds of appeal against conviction are dismissed appeal against sentence appellant argues that the learned magistrate erred when he failed to note summary of facts on which the conviction was recorded in his sentencing remarks there is no essential need for the sentencing court to summarise the facts in the sentencing remarks as a matter of good practice it is desirable for a sentencing magistrate judge to summarise facts in the sentencing ruing so that the reader including the appellate court would know without reading the judgment on what facts a particular sentence was arrived at having gone through the judgment i am satisfied that the sentence is lawful and not disproportionate to the factual circumstances of the offending this ground has not merit and is dismissed other grounds of appeal against sentence are based on premises that the learned magistrate failed to apply sentencing principles and that the sentence is harsh and excessive therefore all these grounds can be dealt with together appellant contends that the sentencing magistrate erred in law when he picked a starting point of one year without outlining the circumstances of the case the sentencing magistrate correctly cited the guideline judgment and mentioned the tariff for indecent assault as between twelve months and four years he has not specifically mentioned why he picked one year as the staring point in picking the starting point a court should be mindful only of objective seriousness of the offence in gauging the objective seriousness a sentencing court is supposed to look at culpability factors and harm caused to the victim as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff in koroivuki v state 2013 fjca 15 aau0018 20 DATE gounder j observed at paragraph 27 in selecting a starting point the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence no reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors the final term should fall within the tariff if the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range learned sentencing magistrate picked one year as the starting point from the bottom edge of the tariff he made no reference to aggravating or mitigating circumstances he considered only the circumstances of offending paragraph 5 when the starting point is picked from the bottom end of the tariff sentencing court is not required to give reasons for doing so as the guideline judgment recommends that the starting point should be picked from within the tariff band preferably from the lower or middle range of the tariff there is no merit for this ground and should be dismissed the learned magistrate cited the correct tariff for the offence of indecent assault that is reflected in paragraph 4 that is 12 months to 4 years imprisonment as per ratu penioni rokota v state criminal appeal no haa00068 of 2002 and further noted the observation made by justice shameem sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years the gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence the indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence the nature of the assault whether it was penetrative whether gratuitous violence was used whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated all reflect on the gravity of the offence mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence these are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the penal code generally the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases a five year sentence may be appropriate a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar and the assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these learned magistrate picked the starting point of twelve months from the bottom end of the tariff before adjusting the sentence for aggravating and mitigating features he reached the final sentence of eighteen months within the tariff he considered aggravating features and added 12 months he deducted 6 months for mitigating features and finally arrived at a sentence of 18 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 months the learned magistrate further noted the appellant s clean record for the past 10 years as a mitigating factor paragraph 9 in his final sentencing remarks learned magistrate considered the nature of the offending in this case and opined that a custodial sentence is inevitable in other words the learned magistrate had directed his mind whether to suspending the sentence or not having considered the circumstances of the offending he decided to impose an immediate custodial sentence the observation of justice shameem in ratu penioni rokota v state a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar and the assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these in my opinion has not taken away the discretion of a sentencing court to consider any other ground s that may prevent a suspended sentence being imposed in this case the offence was committed on a vulnerable mother she is a single handed woman she was residing in a rented house belonging to appellant s mother after this incident she had to relocate herself with her family out of fear of the appellant the appellant had threatened the complainant and said if this matter leaks out i will chop your husband under these circumstances learned magistrate s decision to impose a custodial sentence is not wrong in principle there is no merit to this ground the appellant argues that the learned magistrate erred in law and in principle when he failed to apply the sentencing and penalties decree spd to guide his sentencing options even though the learned magistrate did not directly quote the applicable section under the spd he has considered section 4 2 b c and d and further considered section 18 3 therefore there is no merit to this appeal and should be dismissed further the appellant argues that the learned magistrate failed to accord adequate reduction on mitigation factors this has been considered by the learned magistrate in paragraphs 8 to 10 of the sentencing ruling order conviction recorded by the learned magistrate is lawful and is available in evidence sentence is neither excessive nor unreasonable i affirm the conviction recorded and

criminal case no hac 127 of 2011 4 it is worthy of reminding once again what was highlighted in the case of mohammed kasim v state supra it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point the court of appeal in mohammed kasim supra went on to say that sentence for any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point should be at least 7 years imprisonment and stressed upon the fact that the particular circumstances of each case may decide what the proper sentence to be either substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point whereas justice madigan pointed out in state v leone kotobalavu veresa criminal case no hac 259 of 2013 in recent times with the ever increasing counts of rape coming before high courts sentences of 7 to 15 years have been handed down to the perpetrators 1 justice gates as he was then stated in state v marawa 2004 fjhc 338 that rape is the most serious sexual offence courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by

his submissions in mitigation the victim impact assessment report clearly reflects the emotional and psychological effects to the victim over the alleged sexual acts 3 as it was literally established in court in the course of the trial and correctly pointed out by the state in their sentencing submissions you had abused the authority of your position as the curator of the girls hostel and the bible teacher of their school to sexually molest the complainant making things worse you were a member of the school counseling team as well this demonstrates the back ground of authority you exercised within the circle of hearing impaired and mute girls you not only misused that authority but willingly molested the complainant at your convenience i add 03 years imprisonment for this aggravating behavior of yours 4 the evidence of the complainant as described in paragraph 05 of this sentence clearly shows how you manipulated the sequence of events to achieve your sexual desires you made false and fraudulent representations to the complainant about the nature and the purpose of the sexual acts you intended to commit and made her convinced what you said was genuine and true ms v s being a grown up girl over 16 years at the time of the incidents and been in this hostel for almost 12 years going home only for short periods during the school holidays would have got tempted with your soft approach towards her this is where you had breached the trust that an ordinary girl would place on a teacher especially her bible teacher you had attempted and you were successful in awakening the youth of the complainant by all your false and fraudulent interpretations over sexual intercourse and in doing so you just bargained the trust she had to you as a bible teacher this aspect is clearly visible when she called you as daddy and you told her not to get afraid as im your father and you are my daughter for this aggravating factor i add another 03 years to your starting point 5 it is plainly visible how opportunistic you are in committing these sexual acts the hostel was occupied mainly by hearing impaired and mute set of girls including your wife except your children you maximized that environment to achieve your perverse behavior on top of that the vulnerability of the complainant being a hearing impaired and mute girl who has come from a rural village to secure a better life with education was made worse by your acts of opportunity you had conveniently forgotten that your elder daughter was also in the same age of the complainant at the time of these incidents you simply tried to find shelter and justify this opportunistic approach towards the victim by saying that you were not permitted to take leave from work for a long time not even to visit your sickly father and your physical relationship with your wife was not that healthy this is surely an aggravating factor and i add 02 years for the same to your starting point 6 apart from your opportunistic conduct the acts were very well pre planned to take calculated risks every time you made use of the complainant you planned it in such a way that nobody else sees you in action that preplanning could not be to safeguard the chastity of the complainant but purely to maintain your image as the bible teacher of the school and to be a good husband and a father this was evident when you showed some letters given to you by a girl in the hostel it was not established who exactly it was to your wife whilst molesting the complainant this aggravating factor will attract another 01 year to the starting point over a period of time nearly for 02 months you had repeated the sexual acts for over 06 to 08 times with the complainant the continuance of the abuse of the complainant will attract another 01 year to the starting point 7 finally you showed no remorse to what you did to a hearing impaired and a mute girl who was in your immediate custody that is why you made her to undergo the same mental trauma by recalling the bitter experiences from the witness box you had the audacity to tell that you commit adultery but not rape and though it is morally wrong not wrong before the law therefore there is no point of stating in your mitigation submissions that you know the incident was wrong and you are sincerely sorry for that lack of remorse being an aggravating factor will add another 01 year to your starting point the interim sentence of you will now remain at 19 years imprisonment 8 in mitigation you claim that you are 38 years of age and having three children who are 17 years 15 years and 09 years of age by now their livelihood solely depends on you you have not applied any violence towards the victim nor used any weapon you are a first offender with a previous good character you have co operated with the police from the very beginning according to your analysis the victim has also contributed to this offence by not informing this to any body and left you at the first opportunity if you are been incarcerated the income of the family will be obliterated and the effect on the family will be disastrous finally you are asking for a minimum sentence ranging from 0 to 10 years as the maximum sentence for the offence of rape is 10 years imprisonment this is a total misdirection as compared to the law stated in paragraphs 06 and 07 apart from the fact that you are a first offender with a clean record i see nothing in the mitigation submission to award you any concession i decide to reduce 03 years out of the interim period of imprisonment for that mitigatory ground your final sentence now stands as 16 years imprisonment i order that you to be served a minimum term of 14 years before being eligible for parole 1 finally i must state that the sentence that you are going to receive for this charge of rape is exceeding the tariff limit already in existence nevertheless this court is of the firm view that whatever the sentence you are going to get must reflect the aggravating back ground of which you committed the acts therefore it is inevitable the final sentence to exceed the existing tariff your sentence should not only reflect your punishment for what you had done or the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences your sentence should contain a strong message to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of this nature in view of protecting the ordinary members of the society 2 no body in a civilized society asks or deserves to be raped acts of this nature remind us once again that irrespective of the age or mental and physical impairments of the girls or women they can be victims of sexual violence nobody will be able to justify or offer any valid or acceptable explanation for committing the offence of rape the responsibility entirely lies on the perpetrator and he should face the aftermath of the insult that he caused to the womanhood at this juncture of

254508,sentence 1 you saiyasi matarugu were charged by this court for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which is punishable under section 275 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 2 you pleaded guilty for the said offence on the DATE on your own will and accord i am satisfied that you fully comprehended the legal effect of your plea and your plea was voluntary and free from influence further you admitted to the summary of facts that was read over and explained to you in court which supported the elements of the charge as such you are found guilty and convicted by this court as charged for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm 3 summary of facts as admitted by you before this court revealed that this offence was committed on the DATE at after dark night club namaka nadi 4 further the summary of facts revealed that you assaulted the complainant your wife on the day of the incident complainant had come looking for you at the after dark night club where she had noticed you drinking with another girl complainant then started drinking with her cousin witness amelia tuba after a while the complainant having noticed you going out with the same girl followed you and interrupted and informed the girl with you that the complainant is your wife you thereafter had gone back inside the club and had assaulted the complainant on her face and head whereby she had fallen on the ground feeling dizzy and unable to standup as per the medical report on the complainant she has received a laceration on the upper lip with clots noted on the injury site and left side lip swollen further there had been an open wound 0 5cm lateral to left side lip you have admitted to the allegation when questioned under caution during police investigations 5 submissions in mitigation inter alia has prayed for not to record a conviction the ground on which this plea is made is your employment as a police officer and the consequences a conviction would have on your employment state in filing sentencing submissions had opposed this application this court shall explore the legal boundaries of this application before moving on to decide a suitable sentence on you the application not to record a conviction is based on the provisions of section 16 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 however it is interconnected with the range of sentencing orders a court can make under section 15 of the decree i shall reproduce here both the sections for the sake of clarity section 15 of the sentencing and penalties decree 1 if a court finds a person guilty of an offence it may subject to any specific provision relating to the offence and subject to the provisions of this decree a record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment b record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment partly in custody and partly in the community c record a conviction and make a drug treatment order in accordance with regulations made under section 30 d record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment that is wholly or partly suspended e with or without recording a conviction make an order for community work to be undertaken in accordance with the community work act 1994 or for a probation order under the probation of offenders act cap 22 f with or without recording a conviction order the offender to pay a fine g record a conviction and order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court h record a conviction and order the discharge of the offender i without recording a conviction order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court j without recording a conviction order the dismissal of the charge or k impose any other sentence or make any other order that is authorized under this decree or any other act sub sec 2 5 not relevant for the purpose section 16 of the sentencing and penalties decree 1 in exercising its discretion whether or not to record a conviction a court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including a the nature of the offence b the character and past history of the offender and c the impact of a conviction on the offenders economic or social well being and on his or her employment prospects sub sec 2 3 not relevant 6 it is clear from the above two sections that not recording a conviction would limit the range of sentencing orders a court can make and as such shall be sparingly exercised thus it cannot be said that at any instance a court finds a ground under section 16 is satisfied a conviction should not be recorded certainly there should be a criteria to exercise the discretion of the court not to record a conviction largely owing in my view to the nature and seriousness of a charge among many other considerations as the counsel for the state has correctly highlighted the case of botaki v state 2012 fjhc 1250 haa015 20 DATE clearly highlights these considerations in this case hon justice p madigan held thus the operative word in this section is discretion11 just because an offender will lose his job and just because he will be affected economically does not mean that it is mandatory for a magistrate to invoke the provisions of this section where a magistrate has exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power that it would be in a very exceptional circumstances that an appellate court would interfere with that exercise 8 this is particularly so in cases of domestic violence which this case is the domestic violence decree is clearly a decree which aims to provide greater protection from domestic violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not record a conviction against a perpetrator 9 the appellant has pleaded guilty to the offence and admits facts which go to the elements of the offence the fact that he holds a career position as a vice principal is of no moment this court treats perpetrators alike be they poor or rich of high or lowly status 10 the appeal against conviction is dismissed in the highest sense of clarity the high court of fiji has ruled out domestic violence offences from the range of offences a court can act without recording a conviction thus your plea for not to record a conviction is hereby refused and accordingly the conviction is recorded 7 i now turn to decide a suitable sentence on you i shall consider the appropriate sentence on you under the general principles and guidelines on sentencing and range of sentencing orders as set out in sections 04 and 15 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 in line with the objectives thereof i shall further give special attention to section 4 3 of the decree which reads as follows 3 in sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence a court must also have regard to a any special considerations relating to the physical psychological or other characteristics of a victim of the offence including i the age of the victim ii whether the victim was pregnant and iii whether the victim suffered any disability b whether a child or children were present when the offence was committed or were otherwise affected by it c the effect of the violence on the emotional psychological and physical well being of a victim d the effect of the offence in terms of hardship dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim e the conduct of the offender towards the victim since the offence and any matter which indicates whether the offender i accepts responsibility for the offence and its consequences ii has taken steps to make amends to a victim including action to minimize or address the negative impacts of the offence on a victim iii may pose any further threat to a victim f evidence revealing the offenders i attitude to the offence ii intention to address the offending behaviour and iii likelihood of continuing to pose a threat to a victim and g whether the offender has sought and received counseling or other assistance to address the offending behaviour or is willing to undertake such counseling or seek such assistance 8 having said that i shall now explore the prescribed penalty and the tariff for this offence the maximum punishment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is 05 years of imprisonment the tariff for this offence ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used to 09 months imprisonment for the more serious case of assault state v anjula devi criminal case no 04 of 1998 lab as cited with approval by hon justice goundar in sereka v state 2008 fjhc 88 haa027 2008 DATE hon justice madigan held in state v sikitora 2010 fjhc 466 hac067 2010l DATE that the cases of elizabeth joseph v state 2004 haa 03 of 2004 and state v tevita alati 2004 haa 73 of 2004 establish a tariff 09 months to 12 months imprisonment the severity of the wound being the determining factor in the starting point however sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld in domestic violence cases amasi korovata v state 2006 ha 115 of 2006 9 as per the facts i do not conclude that this incident was unprovoked further there are no weapons used in the commission of the offence however the injuries on the complainant appear to be moderate as per the medical report as per above facts and circumstances i conclude that this offence warrants a prison term and accordingly selects 09 months imprisonment as the starting point the fact that you have seriously breached the trust reposed on you by the complainant as her husband and the fact that by assaulting her in public reflected cruel and degrading treatment towards the complainant clearly aggravates the offence to reflect upon the aggravating factors i add 10 months to your sentence bringing your sentence up to 19 months 10 i now consider the facts in mitigation you are a young first offender and a well respected police officer amongst your superior officers having a 10 year service history you express remorse and promise not to reoffend you have a family with a young child that you financially support you have pleaded guilty to the offence saving time and resources of court and the state to reflect the mitigating factors except for the early guilty plea i discount your sentence by 04 months and the guilty plea is separately discounted for by a further 05 months thus the final sentence on you for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is 10 months imprisonment 11 having in mind the provisions of sec 26 of the sentencing and penalties decree i do concede that this court has the power to suspend your sentence since it is less than 02 years of imprisonment 12 directing my mind on the guideline cases on suspension of sentences dpp v jolame pita 1974 20 flr 5 and more recently dpp v saviriano radovu 1996 42 flr 76 and deo v state 2005 fjca 62 i shall consider whether there are any special circumstances to justify a suspension of your sentence 13 upon the above line of authorities i find the following facts to exist in this case conduct on the part of the complainant partially provoking the incident no serious or permanent physical injuries caused to the complainant being a person of good character having a clear criminal record for the past 33 years no weapons used in the commission of the offence no evidence of continuous violence towards the complainant no evidence of past history of domestic violence 14 accordingly i am of the view that you should be availed of another opportunity to rehabilitate in the main stream without getting mixed with hardened criminals within the four corners of a prison cell in the interest of justice i am therefore satisfied that above factors are to be considered special circumstances justifying a suspension of your sentence 15 you are therefore explained of the scope and effect of a suspended sentence and further the consequences that would follow if you commit another offence during the period of suspension having explained the same i now proceed to suspend your sentence for a period of 03 years 16 in the final outcome your sentence is 10 months imprisonment term suspended for 03 years 17 further to your imprisonment term considering the fact that this offence is one of domestic violence i further make the interim dvro issued against you on the DATE on standard non

2009 alleged to have been committed on DATE the amended information dated DATE describes the particulars of the count as the appellant having had carnal knowledge of p name withheld without her consent 3 after trial the three assessors expressed a unanimous opinion that the appellant was guilty of the said count the learned high court judge on DATE having concurred with their opinion convicted the appellant and imposed a sentence of 08 years of imprisonment with a non parole period of 06 years which should really have been stated as the period during which the appellant would not become eligible to be released on parole in terms of section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 now sentencing and penalties act 2009 preliminary observations 4 the appellant had invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeal against the said conviction and sentence by way of a letter dated DATE addressed to the court of appeal registry several additional grounds of appeal had been submitted later written submissions on behalf the appellant and the respondent also had been tendered on all grounds of appeal chandra rja had allowed leave to appeal in respect of 04 grounds of appeal against the conviction and on a single ground of appeal against the sentence on DATE the appellant had not sought to have the application for leave to appeal determined before the court duly constituted to hear and determine the appeal under section 35 3 of the court of appeal act relating to other grounds where leave was refused 5 the appellant in person and the respondent had tendered written submissions where both parties had confined themselves to the grounds of appeal allowed by chandra rja and at the hearing the counsel for the appellant and the respondent also followed suit grounds of appeal 6 therefore the grounds of appeal that would be considered by this court are as follows ground 1 i the learned trial judge acted unfairly against the appellant in his summing up at paragraph 26 line 9 to line 10 when he made an adverse inference after stating that defence witness siteri gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner ground 2 ii the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the complainant and the supporting witnesses had been inconsistent and significant material evidence being that the alleged bed sheet was not tendered ground 3 iii the learned trial judge erred in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the doctor was not called to confirm allegations via a medical certificate on the presence of injuries as alleged by the complainant pw1 and her aunt pw3 ground 4 iv that the learned judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct himself that the guilty verdicts are unreasonable based on the paucity of evidence led by prosecution at the trial ground on sentence v the learned judge erred in law when he failed to discount the appellants period in remand separately from the mitigating factors summary of evidence 7 the complainant an un married woman of 21 years and the appellant 36 years old and a father of two minor children had met each other following an accidental telephone call and a love affair had begun between the two at about 11 00 p m on DATE the appellant had called the complainant and insisted that she should bring the camera to tacirua and she had agreed reluctantly though to come just to handover it and return home as soon as she arrived in tacirua in a taxi the appellant and his nephew had got in and instructed the taxi driver to go to newtown when they reached newtown the appellant had requested the complainant to get down from the taxi and come to his friends place the complainant had agreed but had told the appellant that she could not stay long all of them had then gone to the appellants friends house after a while she had begged him to allow her to leave but the appellant had not acceded to her request thereafter the appellant had got his friends family to vacate the bedroom and sleep in the sitting area so that the appellant and the complainant could use the bedroom 8 once inside the bedroom the appellant had begged her to have sex with him but she had refused he had tried to kiss her and pushed her onto the bed but no sexual intercourse had taken place in the night they had breakfast in the house next door and once again the appellant had gone inside the said bedroom and asked the complainant to follow while both of them were inside the bedroom the appellant had tried to kiss the complainant and tried very hard to remove her garments she had pushed him away but the appellant had got on top of her despite her resistance when she tried again to push him away he had pushed her forehead down on the bed and landed two punches on her thighs she had told him that she did not want to have sex with him thereafter the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his penis she had still resisted by pushing him away but the appellant had then throttled her neck at that point unable to resist any longer she had given in and the appellants penis had kept moving in and out of the complainants vagina for about 05 minutes she had once again said that she did not agree to what the appellant was doing to her 9 after the act the appellant had given some hot water to the complainant to clean herself and also called his friend to see what had happened i e the blood on her and the bed according to the complainant the blood had came from her vagina both of them had then left in a taxi to go to her aunts place with whom she was staying at laucala beach she had not complained to the police on her way home as the appellant was in the taxi and she was scared to do so upon reaching home the aunt had observed that the complainant was weak and asked her what had happened she had told the aunt that the appellant had raped her and both had agreed that the complainant should report the matter to police accordingly the complainant had made a complaint to the police on 23 september as she was too weak to do so on the same day and she had been later taken to cwm hospital on 26 september she was emphatic that the appellant had raped her 10 the complainants aunt seini lagakali had seen the complaints hands and face or forehead swollen looking dirty ugly and shattered on her arrival along with a boy or a man whom seini identified as the appellant she had been confused and not confident seini had questioned her and the complainant had told her that the appellant had raped her she had suggested going to the police and the complainant had agreed accordingly both of them had visited valelevu police station and given statements 11 the appellants counsel had conceded at the close of the prosecution case that there was a case for the appellant to answer however the appellant did not testify but called siteri gade the wife of dike manasa in whose house the alleged act of rape had taken place dike manasa had been a close friend of the appellant siteri on her own had revealed that she was staying in womans prison at korovou at the time of giving evidence she confirmed that the appellant and the complainant whom she had seen for the first time had come in the early hours of 22 september to their house while they were sleeping and later at the request of the appellant she along with her husband had allowed them to use the bedroom while they slept in the sitting room in the morning the appellant and the complainant had had breakfast and after breakfast both had gone into the bedroom after a while both had come out of the bedroom and the complainant had been normal she had not said anything to her but had taken a shower siteri had given her some clothes both had left their house at about 4 00 p m after they left siteri had removed the bed sheet and laundered it but had seen nothing on it 12 i shall now deal with the grounds of appeal ground 1 the learned trial judge acted unfairly against the appellant in his summing up at paragraph 26 line 9 to line 10 when he made adverse inference after stating that defence witness siteri gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner 13 before i proceed any further i should place on record the observations of his lordship the chief justice in ananda abey raj v the state cav 0003of 2014 DATE 2014 fjsc 12 on the complaints of any non direction and misdirection in appeal quoting the following remarks made in segran murti v the state crim app no cav0016 of 2008s DATE 2009 fjsc 5 paragraphs 11 15 21 23 and truong v the queen 2004 hca10 2004 aljr 473 his lordship said in the instant case counsel for the petitioner was asked by the trial judge whether he sought any re direction at the end of the summing up counsel agreed with prosecuting counsel there was nothing else to direct on this omission is in itself usually sufficient to disregard a ground such as is raised here 14 in ananda abey raj s case his lordship the chief justice further commented upon the failure of both counsel to remind the judge of an omission in the direction to the assessors and had this to say the raising of direction matters in this way is a useful function and in following it counsel assist in achieving a fair trial in doing so they act in their client s interest the appellate courts will not look favourably on cases where counsel have held their seats hoping for an appeal point when issues in directions should have been raised with the judge 15 in this case the learned high court judge had asked both counsel whether any re directions were required and they had replied in the negative 16 the sentences complained of in the summing up is as follows she admitted shes serving time at korovou womens prison at the moment what you make of dw1s evidence is entirely a matter for you 17 a plain reading of the sentence complained of makes it abundantly clear that the learned high court judge has not said that defence witness siteri gade admitted that she was a serving prisoner emphasis mine though the defence counsel had informed the judge in the absence of assessors that she was serving a prison sentence instead what the judge had said was that siteri gade admitted that she was serving time at the said prison she began her evidence at the trial by stating that i am currently staying at womens prison at korovou under cross examination she said i am in womens prison in korovou therefore the learned judge had not said anything that may have conveyed to the assessors any inference other than what the witness herself had already conveyed in her evidence the learned judge followed it up by stating what you make of dw1s evidence is entirely a matter for you thus i disagree that the learned high court judge had conveyed any adverse inference by the sentence aforesaid in the summing up 18 the counsel for the appellant also complained that the learned judge should have directed the assessors that they should disregard siteri gades status in evaluating her evidence what is the status of the witness that the judge could possibly have requested the assessors to ignore there was no evidence of her exact status before court vis à vis the prison had the judge gone any further the assessors being laymen may have got the impression that siteri was in fact serving a sentence as a convicted prisoner the judge had averted that danger by not addressing the assessors any further other than reminding them of her own evidence but adding that they were free to arrive at any conclusion upon her evidence 19 merumeru v the state 1968 14 flr 177 was a case where the appellant while serving a sentence of imprisonment was tried for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the deputy controller of prisons the alleged offence took place in the prison and witnesses were called both by the prosecution and for the defence who were convicted persons serving sentences in his summing up the trial judge told the assessors that they must give such weight as they thought appropriate to the evidence of those witnesses but warned them that it was evidence from a source which put them on their guard and should be scrutinised with care and examined to see if it was corroborated by or consistent with other evidence which they felt able to accept the court of appeal held that later he dealt individually with the evidence of the defence witnesses it is quite clear from his own judgment that he did not believe the two principal defence witnesses viliame vakarewakuila and waisaki madiqi and it may well be that his summing up conveyed that to the assessors but there is nothing wrong in that provided he left the matter to the assessors to form their own opinions and he did that 20 therefore i do not think that the judge should necessarily have given a direction of the so called status of siteri in the summing up and in my view the assessors would not have arrived at a different conclusion even if such a direction had been given i am also of the view that lack of such a specific direction has not resulted in any miscarriage of justice 21 on the other hand siteris evidence in material particulars corroborates the version of the complainant except on the point that she had not seen any blood stain on the bed sheet the complainant seems to have been confronted with this evidence in cross examination and she had replied that siteri was lying in stating that she had collected a bed sheet without blood stain on it thus given a free hand to decide upon siteris evidence by the learned judge i am not surprised that the assessors had chosen not to place reliance on her evidence on the lack of blood stains on the bed sheet and thereby disbelieve the complainant accordingly appeal ground one is rejected ground 2 the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the complainant and the supporting witnesses had been inconsistent and significant material evidence of the alleged bed sheet not having been tendered 22 the appellant firstly complains in his written submissions of three statements found in the complainants evidence under oath which are alleged to be contradictory to her statement to the police however the three statements set out in the written submissions are really omissions alleged to be not found in her police statement but not a single of such alleged omissions had been highlighted in the cross examination of the complainant the police statement of the complainant had not been even referred to in her evidence therefore merely because her police statement is found in the court record the court of appeal cannot peruse it and look for omissions in the complainants evidence under oath the effect of such omissions or inconsistencies could be considered if the complainant had been confronted with them at the trial and allowed her the opportunity to explain if possible thus i do not find any merit in this submission in that context the observations made in gyan v state 1963 9 flr 105 need not be considered 23 secondly the appellant also complained of an alleged inconsistency between the evidence of the complainant and her aunt seini lagakali the complainant had said that the appellant pushed down her forehead onto the bed punched her thighs and even strangled her prior to committing rape seini lagakali had said that she saw her nieces face swollen and her having swollen thighs hands and forehead i do not think that there is any material inconsistency between these two witnesses the evidence of these two witnesses relate to two different aspects with a time span coming in between the complainant speaks of what was done to her while her aunt speaks of what she observed an act and the outward manifestation of it need not be the same and exactly matching i would not reasonably expect these two witnesses to be exact and mathematically precise with regard to the cause and effect of the appellants use of force on the complainant if they are then that would surprise me and give rise to a doubt of a total fabrication 24 even assuming for the sake of argument that there is some inconsistency between the two testimonies when such inconsistency should not be attached with any unwarranted importance at the trial is stated succinctly in bharwada bhoginbhai hirjibhai v state of gujarat 1983 air 753 1983 scr 3 280 by the supreme court of india where it was held inter alia over much importance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance more so when the all important probabilities factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses 25 i am of the view that the alleged inconsistency pointed out by the appellant is of very minor nature and need not have been specifically pointed out when the learned judge had fully set out the evidence of the complainant and her aunt in verbatim in the summing up therefore in my view the assessors would not have expressed any other opinion other than the one recorded even if the judge had pointed out the so called inconsistency to them in the summing up 26 the appellant also argues that the failure on the part of the prosecution to produce the bed sheet is critical to the issue whether the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt defence witness siteri gade has said in evidence that she laundered the bed sheet within a day or two therefore even if there had been blood stains on the bed sheet after the act of rape as claimed by the complainant they may have disappeared with the washing the investigators do not seem to have even searched for the said bed sheet and it had not been listed as an exhibit either thus the prosecution cannot be faulted for not having produced the bed sheet at the trial the bed sheet was not an indispensible item of evidence to prove the prosecution case the defence too had not asked the investigating officer pc 3538 alvind kumar anything about the bed sheet if the bed sheet had been so critical siteri could have produced that herself when she gave evidence in the circumstances i reject the second ground of appeal too ground 3 the learned trial judge erred in fact when he failed to consider in his judgment that the doctor was not called to confirm allegations via a medical certificate on the presence of injuries as alleged by the complainant pw1 and her aunt pw3 27 according to the complainant she had been taken to cwm hospital on 26 september i e the 05th day after the incident one dr tusneer singh his hand written statement dated 26 september and the medical report of the same day had been listed among the disclosures however the prosecution called or produced none at the trial it cannot be denied that had medical evidence been made available at the trial it might have shed some light on the act of sexual intercourse and other injuries what telltale signs of the acts spoken to by the complainant may have remained after five days can only be surmised at this stage the prosecution had not explained at the trial stage as to why the medical evidence was not led their submission before this court is that the requirement of corroboration in law for rape cases has been removed by section 129 of the criminal procedure decree now criminal procedure decree act and therefore medical evidence being of corroborative nature was not absolutely necessary to prove the case 28 in bharwada bhoginbhai hirjibhai v state of gujarat supra the supreme court of india further said corroboration is not the sine quo non for a conviction in a rape case in the indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury viewing assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to the injury viewing evidence of the girl or the women who complains of rape or sexual molestation with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt disbelief or suspicion is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society 29 section 129 of the criminal procedure act states that where any person is tried for an offence of a sexual nature no corroboration of the complainant s evidence shall be necessary for that person to be convicted and in any such case the judge or magistrate shall not be required to give any warning to the assessors relating to the absence of corroboration 30 thus it appears that jurisprudence elsewhere had developed without any statutory compulsion not to insist on corroboration of the victims testimony in rape cases which has been now codified by section 129 of the criminal procedure act therefore technically the position taken up by the state cannot be assailed see also kean v state criminal appeal no aau 95 of 2008 DATE 2013 fjca 117 31 however i am of the view that the legislators would not have intended by section 129 to sanction withholding corroborative evidence if available from court in other words section 129 could not have intended to deprive the court of corroborative material if and when readily available because both the assessors and the judge would always like to see that the evidence would not only satisfy the elements of the offence but also their conscience that not only the guilty would not go unpunished but also that the innocent would not be convicted thus i believe that all what section 129 seeks to achieve is that an accused would not go scot free merely because the complainants evidence is not corroborated by other evidence be it expert evidence such as medical evidence or otherwise section 129 is a shield protecting a truthful but uncorroborated testimony of a complainant but should not be used as a sword against an accused 32 in the instant case there is no doubt that the prosecution could have led medical evidence in fact at the last pre trial conference the prosecution had indicated that it would rely on the medical report too however in terms of law it was not a sine qua none to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant the appellant seems to be under a misapprehension that such evidence was absolutely necessary to prove the complainants allegation of act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent 33 while it is true that medical evidence in a rape case could shed light on either one or both of the said elements surprisingly in this case the appellant had not challenged either of them in the cross examination of the complainant there was not even a suggestion to the complainant that the appellant had not penetrated her vagina or that it happened with her consent the act of sexual intercourse and consent or lack of it were matters within the exclusive knowledge of only the complainant and the appellant the complainant had testified to both the act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent the appellant had not challenged her evidence in cross examination neither had he testified to the contrary the appellant appears to have confronted the complainant only with siteri gades position that the bed sheet had no blood stains only to get an answer from her that siteri was lying 34 in the circumstances the assessors were entitled to act purely on the evidence of the complainant if they had believed her version though there was no medical evidence the injuries on the complainants body to a great degree had been corroborated by her aunts evidence whose observations of the complainants demeanour and injuries also had gone unchallenged in the cross examination even by way of a suggestion further defence witness siteri gades evidence by and large had corroborated the complainants evidence therefore in my view the medical evidence if led would not have changed their opinion the chances are that medical evidence might have further corroborated the complainant therefore in my view failure to lead medical evidence has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice i reject the third ground of appeal ground 4 that the learned judge erred in law and in fact in failing to direct himself that the guilty verdicts are unreasonable based on the paucity of evidence led by prosecution at the trial 35 the gist of the appellants complaint is that it was unreasonable for the learned judge to have accepted the complainants evidence on penile penetration without medical evidence according to his submissions the testimony of the complainant on oath which he has termed as hearsay evidence is not enough to prove the fact of penetration beyond reasonable doubt and medical evidence is the only credible evidence to prove penetration thus the appellant argues that the trial judge had erred in law and in fact in affirming the guilty verdict of the assessors without weighing the entirety of evidence before him at the trial he also has submitted that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence resulting in gross miscarriage of justice 36 the learned judge in his judgment has stated inter alia that he had reviewed the evidence directed himself in accordance with the summing up and held that the assessors verdict was not perverse and it was open to them to reach the conclusion they had reached on the evidence accordingly he had accepted the assessors verdict 37 the appellant relies on ram v state criminal appeal no cav0001 of 2011 DATE 2012 fjsc 12 to argue that the learned judge should have independently assessed the evidence for him to satisfy that the ultimate verdict is supported by evidence and is not perverse however in kaiyum v state criminal appeal no aau 0071 2012 DATE 2014 fjca 35 the court of appeal held otherwise on the basis that the above statement in ram was obiter dicta and the supreme court had approved on other occasions the practice of the trial judge writing a short judgment confirming with the assessors opinion in compliance with section 237 of the criminal procedure act 2009 in the following terms while we accept that in ram the supreme court did state that an independent analysis of evidence by the trial judge was necessary to ensure the verdict is supported by evidence the remark is only an obiter dicta we say this because the remark was made in the course of formulating the test when a guilty verdict is challenged on the basis that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence see section 23 1 a of the court of appeal act in subsequent cases the supreme court has clarified that where the trial judge agrees with the opinions rendered by the assessors section 237 of the criminal procedure decree does not require the trial judge to carry out an independent analysis of evidence before pronouncing judgment but the supreme court has endorsed that a short written judgment even where conforming with the assessors opinions is a sound practice state v miller unreported cav 8 of 2009 DATE mohammed v state unreported cav 2 of 2013 DATE 38 therefore i do not think that the complaint of the appellant on this score is sustainable 39 his complaint of lack of medical evidence has already been dealt with in some detail earlier the appellant seems to think that the complainants evidence in regard to the act of sexual intercourse and want of consent is hearsay evidence this is a complete misconception her evidence is direct and the best evidence on both elements her aunts recent complaint evidence corroborates the complainants evidence on the effects of use of force by the appellant medical evidence is only of corroborative value no medical evidence taken alone could prove a case of rape except in a rare and exceptional case where for example the complainant is dead 40 if the appellant had considered the medical evidence to be so crucial he could have called the doctor as part of his defence at the end of the prosecution case he conceded that there was a case to answer which means that he thought that there was at least a prima facie case placed by the prosecution before court even without the medical evidence both on the act of rape and lack of consent the two ingredients of the offence he was charged with he did not answer the prosecution case with regard to those two matters apart from the complainant only the appellant could have testified to one or both of the critical elements of the offence in the affirmative or negative neither did he call his friend dike manasa but only called siteri gade friends wife siteris evidence does not constitute a frontal attack on the complainants evidence on the act of sexual intercourse and lack of consent on the contrary in general even siteri corroborates the complainants version of events that took place in siteris house 41 the appellant relies on the case of kaiyum in support of his argument that in the absence of medical evidence the case against him had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence in kaiyam one of the complaints of the appellant was on the inadequacy of the medical evidence led by the prosecution and the court had found that the inadequacy could be explained having regard to the other evidence and held that no criticism can be made regarding the medical evidence in that case thus kaiyum is not an authority to the appellants proposition that no rape could be proved without medical evidence on the other hand kaiyum has not considered section 129 of the criminal procedure act 2009 in terms of section 129 no prosecution in respect of an offence of a sexual nature should fail for lack of corroboration of the complainants evidence provided her testimony could be relied upon it further states that no direction on the absence of such corroboration is also required thus even the judge need not necessarily direct himself or herself on the lack of medical evidence being corroborative material in a case of rape in his judgment 42 i have carefully examined the entirety of evidence led in this case and i cannot help but feel that the appellant had taken advantage of the complainant who had trusted him to the extent that she thought that her relationship with him was unbreakable she is described as a humble and quiet person who would not talk back even when in disagreement to his detriment the appellant appears to have been under the impression that because the complainant was his girlfriend he had an open licence to have sexual intercourse with her even against her consent i am certain that the appellant knew very well that when he penetrated her vagina he was doing it against her will because by that time she had finally given up her resistance having been overpowered by the appellants superior physical strength and rough tactics the appellant had simply betrayed her 43 analysing the evidence of the prosecution carefully i find that the victim s testimony has stood the test of probability consistency lack of contradictions promptness and been enhanced by the corroboration in the form of the observations made by her aunt it may also be mentioned as a passing remark that there is no apparent motive for the victim to have falsely implicated the appellant for having committed rape i have no doubt that on evidence the case against the appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt 44 in rajinder raju v state of h p criminal appeal no 670 of 2003 decided on 07 07 2009 r m lodha j speaking on behalf of the supreme court of india said a woman victim of sexual aggression would rather suffer silently than to falsely implicate somebody any statement of rape is an extremely humiliating experience for a woman she would not blame anyone but the real culprit while appreciating the evidence of the prosecutrix the courts must always keep in mind that no self respecting woman would put her honour at stake by falsely alleging commission of rape on her 45 when a verdict is challenged on the basis that it is unreasonable the test is whether the trial judge could have reasonably convicted on the evidence before him vide ram and kaiyum in my view neither the opinion of the assessors nor the verdict of the learned judge could be considered as unreasonable i think having regard to the evidence led the appellant could have been convicted of the charge levelled against him and therefore the verdict of guilt against the appellant could be supported i would follow ram where the supreme court held that an appellate court will not set aside a verdict of a lower court unless the verdict is unsafe and dangerous having regard to the totality of evidence in the case thus the forth ground of appeal is rejected ground on sentence the learned judge erred in law when he failed to discount the appellants period in remand separately from the mitigating factors 46 the learned high court judge had considered the appellants period of remand i e 01 year and 08 months under mitigating factors along with the fact that the appellant had committed a sex offence for the first time though having 07 previous convictions and given a reduction of 04 years for both under mitigating factors 47 section 24 of the sentencing and penalties act 2009 states that if an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall unless a court otherwise orders be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender 48 in sowane v state cav 0038 of 2015 DATE 2016 fjsc 8 the supreme court following basa v state aau0024 of 2005 DATE 2006 fjca 23 approved the practice of arriving at the head sentence after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors as it has the advantages of simplicity and clarity and thereafter regard any period of remand already served by the appellant and give a substantial allowance for that period such reduction need not be the exact days or even weeks spent on remand 49 the court of appeal in domona v state aau 0039 of 2013 DATE 2016 fjca 110 following sowane said that in future the time spent in remand must not be considered as a mitigating factor and it should be considered separately as stipulated by law i couldnt agree more giving reasonable and substantial allowance to the period of custody after the final sentence is arrived to determine the head sentence brings clarity and transparency to the sentencing process apart from being compliant with section 24 of the sentencing and penalties act 2009 50 therefore it is clear that the learned judge should have considered the appellants period of remand after arriving at the final sentence however both sowane and domona were decided in the year 2016 and the trial judge did not have the benefit of them when he decided the appellants case in the year 2013 nevertheless there is merit in the appellants complaint 51 now the question is how this court should approach the appellants complaint in ananda abey raj v the state cav 0003 of 2014 DATE 2014 fjsc 12 while approving the decision in naisua v state crim app no cav 0010 of 2013 DATE 2013 fjsc 14 the supreme court reiterated that the appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors i acted upon a wrong principle ii allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him iii mistook the facts iv failed to take into account some relevant considerations 52 in kasim v state criminal appeal no aau 0021 of 1993 DATE 1994 fjca 25 the court of appeal said we consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 53 in drotini v the state criminal appeal no aau0001 of 2005s 20 DATE 2006 fjca 26 the court of appeal though not having ventured into altering the starting point suggested in kasim said the continuing frequency of such cases has resulted in a general increase in the levels of sentence ordered in rape cases by the courts in fiji we endorse this trend 54 it is clear that the trial judge has started the usual sentencing process with 07 years imprisonment which is the lowest point of the tariff for adult rape cases going up to 15 years in koroivuki v state criminal appeal no aau 0018 of 2010 DATE 2013 fjca 15 it was held that as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff in this regard the appellant has got the maximum allowance the trial judge has reduced 04 years for the first offence and period of remand under mitigating factors i am certain that if not for the remand period the trial judge would not have deducted 04 years for the appellant being found guilty of a sex offence for the first time under mitigating factors 55 i would like to remind myself of the following words of wisdom also in dealing with this ground of appeal dr anand j on behalf of the supreme court of india said in the state of punjab vs gurmit singh others 1996 air 1393 1996 scc 2 384 we must remember that a rapist not only violates the victims privacy and personal integrity but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim a murderer destroys the physical body of his victim a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female of late crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase 56 in lokesh mishra v state of nct delhi crl a 768 2010 decided on DATE by the high court of delhi kailash gambhir j said it is appalling to see that rape rears its ugly facade almost every day rape is one such dark reality that devastates a womens soul shatters her self respect and for a few purges their hope to live it shakes the insight of a woman who once was a happy person and had no clue of being a victim of the said horrifying and nightmarish encounters 57 in ananda abey raj the chief justice quoted the following remarks made in state v av 2009 fjhc 24 hac 192 2008 DATE rape is the most serious form of sexual assault sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences 58 in koroicakau v the state criminal appeal no ca0006 of 2005s decided on DATE 2006 fjsc 5 the supreme court observed when a sentence is reviewed on appeal again it is the ultimate sentence rather than each step in the reasoning process that must be considered different judges may start from slightly different starting points and give somewhat different weight to particular facts of aggravation or mitigation yet still arrive at or close to the same sentence 59 saleem marsoof j in the supreme court said in quari v state criminal petition no cav 24 of 2014 DATE 2015 fjsc 15 in my considered view it is precisely because of the complexity of the sentencing process and the variability of the circumstances of each case that judges are given by the sentencing and penalties decree a broad discretion to determine sentence in most instances there is no single correct penalty but a range within which a sentence may be regarded as appropriate hence mathematical precision is not insisted upon but this does not mean that proportionality a mathematical concept has no role to play in determining an appropriate sentence 60 the ultimate object of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 coupled with the judicial guidelines is to help judges arrive at a just and fair sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence for an accused considering all the circumstances of the case while maintaining an acceptable degree of uniformity and consistency it is not to insist on a straightjacket approach to sentencing mathematical accuracy is not what is expected in sentencing see bijendra v state criminal appeal no aau 0056 of 2013 DATE 2016 fjca 111 turogo v state criminal appeal no aau 0008 of 2013 DATE 2016 fjca 117 matasavui v state criminal appeal no aau 0036 of 2013 DATE 2016 fjca 118 61 i have revisited all the circumstances of the case and feel that the appellant may have been somewhat lucky to have escaped with a sentence of 08 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 06 years the last person who the complainant thought would rape her would have been her boyfriend the appellant who should have been her protector and guardian therefore i am convinced that the ultimate sentence of 08 years imprisonment should not be disturbed as it meets the ends of justice 62 in a somewhat similar case rainima v state criminal appeal no aau 0022 of 2012 DATE 2015 fjca 17 the court of appeal said as follows similarly the trial judge has taken into account the remand period of the appellant also as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence the deduction of 5 years for the offence of rape in this case can be reasonably accounted for the time spent in remand the guilty plea and the good behavior good character of the appellant i am of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial court is lawful and this court should not intervene with it therefore pursuant to section 23 3 of the court of appeal act cap 12 the appeal is dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge is affirmed 63 therefore considering all the circumstances of the case i am not inclined to interfere with the sentence imposed on the appellant i think the sentence of 08 years imprisonment with a minimum period of 06 years to be served before the appellant becoming eligible for parole is fully justified the sentence is not excessive there are no exceptional circumstances for this court to revise it the sentence has not caused any substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant and therefore i reject the ground of appeal on sentence 64 therefore i conclude that the appeal should stand dismissed and the conviction and sentence be affirmed perera ja 65 i have read in draft the judgment of prematilaka ja and i

251896,judgment introduction the appellant filed this appeal against the conviction and sentence the appellant was charged in the magistrates court of lautoka with one count of indecent assault contrary to section 212 1 of the crimes decree 2009 the complainant was appellant s granddaughter the appellant was convicted of the charge after a full trial and on DATE the learned magistrate sentenced the appellant to 18 months imprisonment the appellant has filed a notice of appeal against the conviction and sentence within time 5 facts accepted by the trial magistrtae the complainant is appellant s granddaughter she was 12 years old at the time of the incident on the DATE she was staying at appellant s place when she was lying down on a bed appellant came and sat beside her appellant put his hand inside her top and touched her breasts then he touched her private parts on top of her cloths appellant asked her how she feels when he touched her breasts the complainant started crying and she informed her sister about the incident later they informed about the incident to their father and the matter was reported to the police 6 grounds of appeal conviction learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the evidence if the complainant witness who were juveniles and as such proper direction ought to have been given regarding taking oath learned magistrate erred in law and fact in not taking into consideration the appellant s submission on no case to answer at the end of prosecution case he also did not apply the relevant laws to the facts that were presented by the state learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing and misdirecting that the prosecution evidence before the court proved beyond reasonable that there were serious doubts in the prosecution case and as such the benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the appellant learned magistrate failed to direct himself on the question of burden of proof in that the prosecution has proved all the allegation against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubts learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not properly analyzing all facts before him before he made a decision that the appellant was guilty as charged on the charge of indecent assault learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the possible defence on evidence learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering and or rejecting the evidence of defence witnesses that were called by the defence learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give proper weight as to when the date of the complaint was made by the complainant against the appellant and to say that it appears the witnesses have given their statements to the police soon after the incident raised serious doubt in the prosecution case learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself to the significance of prosecution witnesses conflicting evidence during the trial learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into adequate consideration the evidence if all the defence witnesses in deciding that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged sentence sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principal in all circumstances of the case learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the appellant and not taking relevant matters into consideration learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in denying the appellant his right to mitigation of sentence analysis ground 1 learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the evidence if the complainant witness who were juveniles and as such proper direction ought to have been given regarding taking oath at the trial prosecution called two witnesses the victim 12 and her sister 11 both of whom were children within the meaning of the juveniles act at the time they gave evidence as per the record both child witnesses gave sworn evidence the trial magistrate before proceeding to record their evidence under oath did not hold a competency test to ascertain whether the child witnesses understood the nature and solemnity of the oath the counsel for appellant submits that the trial magistrate did not comply with section 10 1 of the juveniles act and fell into error when he found the appellant guilty on evidence of child witnesses whose evidence was not tested against competency section 10 1 of the juveniles act provides as follows where in any proceedings against any person for any offence or in any civil proceedings any child of tender years called as a witness does not in the opinion of the court understand the nature of an oath his evidence may proceed not on oath if in the opinion of the court he is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth and the evidence though not given on oath but otherwise taken and reduced into writing so as to comply with any law in force for the time being shall be deemed to be a deposition within the meaning of any law so in force provided that where evidence is admitted by virtue of this section on behalf of the prosecution the accused shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless that evidence is corroborated there is a requirement under section 10 that a child witness of tender years should be subjected to a competence inquiry where he or she is required to demonstrate an understanding of the nature and solemnity of an oath the oath test required children to express knowledge of the fact that they would be committing a sin and burn in the fires of hell if they lied on oath r v brasier 1779 168 eng rep 202 k b if the child witness passes the oath test he is competent to give sworn evidence but his or her evidence is still subjected to the common law warning of corroboration if the child witness fails the competency test the trial court can record unsworn evidence if it was satisfied that the child witness possessed sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of evidence and understood the duty of speaking the truth however the accused is not liable to be convicted on unsworn evidence unless that evidence is corroborated the effects of section 10 were clearly explained by shameem j in agnu v state unreported criminal appeal no haa067 of 20 DATE at p5 the law on the evidence of children is that where a child gives unsworn evidence corroboration is required as a matter of law that means that without corroboration a conviction is impossible where however a child gives sworn evidence a corroboration warning should be given as a matter of practice on the basis that the evidence of children may be unreliable without some supporting evidence independent of the child and implicating the accused a careful examination of case law in fiji would indicate that up until the landmark judgment of state v av 2009 fjhc 18 hac192 20 DATE the courts in fiji had strictly applied the rules of evidence concerning children of tender years as was provided in section 10 of the juveniles act and the failure to hold an inquiry into the competency of a child witness had resulted in the conviction being quashed lal khan 1981 73 cr app r 190 fazal mohammed v the state 1990 91 cr

supra held that section 10 of the juveniles act cap 56 and the common law requirement for corroboration and competency test for child witnesses unfairly discriminated against children on the ground of age and deprived them equality before the law as guaranteed by the constitution amendment act 1997 the 1997 constitution therefore the court considered section 10 of the juveniles act as stricken from the said act in av supra the victim was called to give evidence at the magistracy before receiving her evidence the trial magistrate did not carry out a competency inquiry as was required by section 10 of the juveniles act cap 56 the trial magistrate believed the victims evidence and convicted the offender the case was then transferred to the high court for sentence the high court confirmed the correctness of the conviction and sentenced the offender the same issue arose before the court of appeal in the case of kumar v state 2015 fjca 32 aau0049 20 DATE which was decided under the present constitution where a similar equality provision has been incorporated section 26 1 of the constitution states every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection treatment and benefit of the law endorsing the sentiments expressed in av supra and having analyzed the case law in england and canada the court of appeal gounder ja observed we endorse the above remarks every child in fiji now has a constitutional right to be protected from abuse or any form of violence this right is expressly provided by section 41 1 d of the constitution rape is the worst kind of sexual abuse that can be inflicted on a child the courts have a constitutional duty to protect the children from any form of sexual abuse by taking into consideration matters that are in their best interests section 41 2 of the constitution states the best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child in our judgment any law that restricts child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization cannot be regarded as being in the childs best interests and is inconsistent with the childrens right to equality before the law there is a growing recognition that child sexual abuse is often perpetrated by family members close family friends or trusted community figures in these circumstances corroboration that is independent evidence implicating the accused to the alleged sexual abuse will rarely exist the competency inquiry and the requirement for corroboration for child witnesses have no legitimate purpose in criminal proceedings involving children as victims of sexual abuse both the competency inquiry and requirement for corroboration for child witnesses in criminal proceedings are invalid under section 2 2 of the constitution the object of this interpretation was to apply to children the ordinary test of competence regardless of any real or notional additional test previously imposed on them if they gave sworn or unsworn evidence such as a requirement to determine whether the child understands nature and solemnity of the oath and the special importance of telling the truth in a court in addition to his or her duty to do so as part of normal social conduct however in kumar supra calanchini p had some reservations about the need to give corroboration warning his lordship acknowledged that evidence of the child witness did not have to be corroborated but he said that a warning about the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child should still be required if the child does not understand the nature of the oath calanchini p concluded his judgment by saying that children especially young children are still young children with all the frailties that are associated with childhood the supreme court in kumar v state 2016 fjsc 44 cav0024 2016 DATE held that the requirement in section 10 of the juveniles act that unsworn evidence of a child witness has to be corroborated is unconstitutional and therefor invalid 22 it was further observed in other jurisdictions a child s evidence is given unsworn that has been the position in england in respect of children under the age of 14 since 1988 see section 33a 1 of the criminal justice act 1988 that recognizes that the form in which the evidence is given is far less important than the child s ability to understand the questions they are being asked to give answers which can be understood and to appreciate the need to tell the truth giving evidence in court can be an intimidating experience even for adults and requiring a child to take the oath could serve to increase their discomfort in my opinion therefore it is far more appropriate for a child to give evidence unsworn and for the distinction in section 10 1 of the juveniles act between the sworn and unsworn evidence of a child to be abolished as has occurred in england of the requirement to conduct a competence inquiry the supreme court observed the same applies to the existing requirement for a judge to conduct a competence inquiry before the child gives evidence to ascertain whether to use the language of section 10 1 the child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth in my opinion the more appropriate course is to follow what has been the practice in england for almost 30 years and to leave it to the judge to decide whether to conduct a competence inquiry before the child gives evidence and for the requirement in section 10 1 of the juveniles act that the judge must do so to be abolished although again i can only give effect to that view if that requirement is inconsistent with the constitution of the requirement of giving corroboration warning the supreme court observed the same also applies albeit with one refinement to the warning to the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child the more appropriate course is to follow what again has been the practice in england for almost 30 years and for the requirement at common law for the judge to warn the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child to be abolished the supreme court was not prepared to accept the proposition that the practice to give corroboration warning and the obligation to hold a competence inquiry discriminated against children the court observed it also follows that i am in respectful disagreement with goundar ja s judgment in the court of appeal that the competence inquiry which the judge is required by section 10 1 to conduct before a child can give evidence and the requirement at common law for a warning of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child are inconsistent with the constitution and therefore invalid however whether the requirement for a warning of this kind should remain part of the common law is another matter for the reasons given in 33 above i believe that fiji should follow the path taken in england many years ago and treat that requirement as no longer representing part of our common law accordingly the fact that the trial judge did not give the assessors that warning does not undermine kumar s conviction having said that there may be some cases in which the trial judge thinks that a warning of this kind is desirable that may have something to do with the nature of the child s evidence or the way it was given or it may have something to do with the assessors themselves the trial judge is in the best position to assess that so although there should no longer be any requirement on trial judges to give a warning of this kind they may do so if they think that it is appropriate in a particular case the same is true of the inquiry which the judge is required to conduct to determine before the child gives evidence whether the child can give unsworn evidence namely whether the child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth i do not see how such a requirement discriminates against children whether the witness is a child or an adult the judge always has to assess the witness competence to give evidence a child may not be mature enough to give evidence in just the same way as an adult may have a mental disorder which makes him incompetent as a witness so the need for the judge to determine whether a particular witness understands the questions they are asked or is able to answer those questions in a way which can be understood or appreciates the need to tell the truth applies just as much to adults as it does to children section 10 1 does no more than to emphasize the need for that when the witness is a child however the supreme court did not disagree with the proposition that a requirement in any law restricting child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization is in conflict with the child s best interests gounder ja in av supra referred to rights which the constitution affords to children his lordship referred to article 41 1 d of the constitution which affirms the right of every child to be protected from abuse and also to article 41 2 of the constitution which states the best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child 28 the supreme court in kumar supra concluded that the trial judge should have determined before the child witness gave evidence whether he or she could give sworn evidence if he had decided that she could not he should then have determined whether she could give unsworn evidence however failure to do those things does not mean that the conviction of the defendant has to be quashed emphasis added 29 in its concluding remarks the supreme court observed as goundar j noted in both his judgment in av at 19 and in his judgment in the court of appeal in the present case at 22 there have been many cases in which the failure of the judge to inquire into the competency of the child to give evidence whether sworn or unsworn has resulted in the conviction being quashed with some diffidence i question this line of authority at any rate in its application to this case i do not believe that the assessors were less likely to accept the girl s evidence if it had been unsworn than if it had been sworn and if it had been apparent to the trial judge in the course of the girl s evidence that she did not satisfy the conditions for giving even unsworn evidence he would have directed the assessors to disregard her evidence the fact that he did not do that means that he must have thought that she was intelligent enough to understand that she had to tell the truth in the circumstances despite the trial judge not having done what section 10 1 required him to do no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred emphasis added in the present case the child witnesses were 12 and 11 years of age once the witnesses had begun to testify the trial magistrate would have made them incompetent witnesses if they appeared to him to be of unsound mind incoherent or lacking communication skills the trial magistrate did not do that he having carefully listened to the evidence appears to have proceeded on the assumption a fair assumption in the light of the trial magistrate s decision to allow the girls to be sworn that the witnesses had sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the oath i am of the view that the failure on the part of the magistrate to hold the competence inquiry at the beginning of child witnesses testimony did not prejudice the appellant two child witnesses in this case gave evidence under oath therefore question of giving corroboration warning arises only if that requirement is still valid in common law the common law rule that evidence of child witness whether sworn or unsworn need to be corroborated has now been abolished however if the trial magistrate had formed the view that child witnesses were not possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of their evidence and that they did not understand the duty of speaking the truth then the law predates av judgment required as a matter of law evidence of the victim to be corroborated if the witnesses gave unsworn evidence corroboration is evidence independent of the witness to be corroborated which confirms in some material particular not only that the crime was committed but that the accused committed it r v baskerville 1910 2 kb 658 in the present case the victim was in fact corroborated in material particular by her sister victim s sister said that she was playing outside with her small sister and when she was crossing a room inside the house she saw the grandfather appellant touching her sister s private parts and asking if she liked it she said that she saw her sister crying therefore assuming that common law requirement to give corroboration warning with regard to sworn evidence as enunciated in agnu v state supra is still applicable failure to conduct the competency test did not prejudice the appellant because the child victim was corroborated in material particular therefor even if the the obligation on the magistrate to be satisfied at the beginning that the child had the necessary capacity to give evidence is still valid in fiji the trial magistrate did not fell into error because child victim s evidence was corroborated by her sister on material particular in the case of state v a v supra the learned high court judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence the court of appeal in chand v state 2016 fjca 20 aau065 2011 DATE held that the obligation on the part of the magistrate or the judge to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence would amount to a violation of section 26 1 of the constitution at paragraph 15 to 19 counsel for the appellant had sought to place reliance on the high court case of the state v a v 2009 fjhc 24 hac 192 of 2008 DATE which he states was endorsed by the court of appeal in the case of rahul ravinesh kumar v the state criminal appeal no aau0049 of 2012 in the case of the state v a v the learned high court judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence i have examined this decision and find this had been stated by way of obiter this undoubtedly is a good practice but it cannot be said that the failure to do so was fatal to the conviction of the appellant to hold otherwise would amount to a violation of section 26 1 of the constitution which states every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law section 26 3 of the constitution prohibits unfair discrimination against a person directly or indirectly on the ground of age section 26 7 of the constitution states treating one person differently from another on any of the grounds prescribed under subsection 3 is discrimination unless it can be established that the difference in treatment is not unfair in the circumstances section 26 8 prescribes circumstances under which the right to equality and freedom from discrimination can be derogated but none of those circumstances apply to the evidence of children of tender years in light of this judgment failure on the part of the trial magistrate to remind the child witnesses of their duty to tell the truth is not a fatal irregularity i am of the view that the appellant was accorded due process before he was convicted on the child witness s valid testimony i conclude that the trial magistrates decision to disregard section 10 of the juveniles act is in the best interest of the child guaranteed under the constitution this ground of appeal therefore should fail ground 2 according to the court copy record at page 23 and 24 as soon as the prosecution case was closed counsel for the appellant informed court that she wished to summon the mother of the complainant to give evidence by saying this she appears to have accepted that there was a case to answer on the available evidence hence she did not make an application or submission in support of no case to answer appellant cannot complain now that he was not given the opportunity to make an application for no case to answer or any submission in its support there was no submission made by the appellant on no case to answer at the end of the prosecution case therefore the claim that the learned magistrate failed to consider her submission on no case to answer does not hold water moreover sections 178 and 179 of the criminal procedure decree 2009 clearly state that the court has to determine the evidence at the end of prosecution case and then inform the accused of his rights after reading the charge to him again 43 relevant part of sections 178 and 179 read as follows 178 if at the close of the evidence in support of the charge it appears to the court that a case is not made out against the accused person sufficiently to require him or her to make a defence the court shall dismiss the case and shall acquit the accused 179 1 at the close of the evidence in support of the charge if it appears to the court that a case is made out against the accused person sufficiently to require the making of a defence the court shall the test applicable in the magistrates court is whether taken at its highest a reasonable court could convict on the prosecution case at the close of the prosecution case there was ample evidence before court against the appellant sufficient a reasonable court could convict on the prosecution case therefore trial magistrate s decision to read out the charge and put the appellant to his defence did not violate the procedural requirement of the law ground 3 9 there is no submission before this court of what is the serious doubt as was claimed by the appellant nor is there any submission before this court to be considered that prosecution witnesses gave conflicting evidence during the trial i considered the evidence given by two prosecution witnesses and found no material contradiction sufficient enough to discredit the version of the prosecution these grounds are incomplete and not substantiated by the appellant in any event the learned trial magistrate has quite clearly said in his judgment that the prosecution case was consistent and reliable as compared to the defence witnesses who were inconsistent there is no merit in these grounds ground 4 at paragraph 4 of the judgment the learned magistrate set out that it is the prosecution s duty to prove the offence against the accused beyond reasonable doubt there is no basis for the claim of the appellant that the learned magistrate did not direct himself to the law on burden of proof the appellant submits that by stating that the defence could not challenge the evidence given by the prosecution the learned magistrate shifted the burden to the defence to prove his innocence i do not find any basis for this submission trial magistrate at the close of the prosecution case only had the prosecution version and therefore one side of the story upon being satisfied that there is a case to answer the court is required to give an opportunity to the accused to tell his side of the story and also attack the credibility of the version of the prosecution in the process of evaluating evidence of the defence the court is required to assess the credibility of the evidence adduced by the defence in this case the learned trial magistrate stated with the words highlighted by the appellant that evidence adduced by the defence did not damage the prosecution case or challenge the credibility of the prosecution witnesses ultimately the court accepted that prosecution has proved the offence beyond reasonable doubt this ground has no merit and should be dismissed grounds 5 6 7 10 these grounds are misconceived and have no basis the trial magistrate in his judgment has clearly narrated in individual paragraphs the evidence of all the defence witnesses furthermore the trial magistrate then analyzed the defence evidence and came to the conclusion that he does not accept the defence version he also provided reasons for doing so i find the evidence of the appellant self serving witnesses called by the defence contradicted each other the learned trial magistrate has highlighted those contradictions and has given due consideration to inconsistencies when he decided to disbelieve the version of the defence ground 8 appellant contends that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give proper weight as to when the date of the complaint was made by the complainant against the appellant and to say that it appears the witnesses have given their statements to the police soon after the incident raised serious doubt in the prosecution case counsel for appellant submits that the prosecution did not have evidence of the date of the alleged offence and learned magistrate s above mentioned statement is mere speculation prosecution has led evidence of the complainant on the basis that the alleged incident occurred between the 2nd day of february and DATE page 17 of the copy record the defence counsel has cross examined the complainant on the basis that the incident occurred on the DATE when the sister of the complainant aaliya was giving evidence the defence counsel cross examined her on the basis that she made her statement to police on DATE therefore there was concrete evidence before the trial magistrate that the complaint was made soon after the incident there is no basis for this ground and therefore should fail appeal against sentence first two grounds have been advanced on the basis that the sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principal therefore grounds 1 and 2 can be considered together this court will approach an appeal against sentence using

the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if he mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some relevant consideration

facts iv failed to take into account some relevant consideration the fiji court of appeal in sharma v state unreported cr app no aau0065 of 20 DATE discussed the approach to be taken when exercising appellate jurisdiction in reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court the court observed in determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge the approach taken by this court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or in other words that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range it follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion this court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range however it must be recalled that the test is not whether the judges of this court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence it must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust tariff for indecent assault was set out in rakota v state 2002 fjhc 168 haa0068j 2002s DATE sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years the gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence the indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence the nature of the assault whether it was penetrative whether gratuitous violence was used whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated all reflect on the gravity of the offence mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence these are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the penal code generally the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases a five year sentence may be appropriate a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar and the assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these this tariff has been accepted for the same offence under the crimes decree 2009 as well state v mario 2014 fjhc 935 hac 70 71 2013 DATE the appellant received 18 months imprisonment for indecently assaulting his granddaughter who was 12 years old considering the circumstances especially the aggravating features such as the age gap and breach of trust the appellant has received a very lenient sentence the appellant claims that he was not given an opportunity to file his mitigation however the court copy record shows otherwise the appellant and his counsel were given two opportunities to file mitigation obviously the court cannot adjourn and wait indefinitely for the appellant to file his mitigation nevertheless the learned magistrate gave due consideration to his old age and his clear record in his mitigation as regards the 3rd ground against sentence the appellant has not specifically mentioned what relevant matters the sentencing magistrate failed to take into consideration and what irrelevant matters he considered in coming to his final sentence there are no merits in these grounds and should be dismissed sentence imposed by

dressed only in a towel and were about to have your bath to go to work your wife asked for and demanded money as she said she was hungry there was food in the house cooked by you the previous night chicken and cassava your wife was drunk she continued to demand money and you refused saying that you only had 5 00 and you needed that for your bus fare to get to work your wife followed you to the bathroom and after putting your daughter down you punched her in the face whilst she attempted to protect herself you punched her and she went outside you followed and caught her and punched her she

the circumstances taking account the provocation as found by the assessors and the court your prior record and the punishment you have and will suffer having killed the mother of your child the aggravating factors in the offence you committed is the severity of the attack on your wife and the fact that you followed and even chased her outside and continued the assault it wasn t merely 1 or 2 blows the punishment for manslaughter in this country has been considered by the court of appeal in kim nam bae v the state aau0015 of 1998s where the court said the task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculations this is particularly so with manslaughter where the circumstances and the offender s culpability can vary greatly from case to case an appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations in order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case the courts must have regard to sentences imposed by the high court and the court of appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence the cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal it is important to bear in mind that this range covers a very wide set of varying circumstances which attract different sentences in different manslaughter cases each case will attract the appropriate sentence within the range depending on its own facts in sashi kapoor rayan v the state crim app aau0028 of 2000s the court noted that sentences for manslaughter of a serious kind range from 7 to 10 years state counsel submits that the circumstances of this matter cause it to fall in the middle range and i take that to be a range of 3 to 6 years i have been referred to several authorities by counsel but each matter must depend on its own particular facts but the resultant sentence should be within the range the authorities set the incidence of domestic violence offences in this country seems disproportionately high with a high degree of acceptance of violence towards women it is incumbent on the court to clearly show that such behaviour is not acceptable in any community in the 21st century i am of the opinion that an appropriate starting point in this instance is 5 years imprisonment accepting as i do that you were provoked that you are of previous good character and that from your record you are not likely to re offend i give you a discount of 18 months you have served 3 months imprisonment whilst on remand which when adjusted for remission equates to about 5 months and i give you credit for this as i have

73503,judgment this is an appeal against sentence by the appellant who was sentenced to a total term of nine years imprisonment on DATE for the following offences first count statement of offence rape contrary to section 149 of the penal code cap 17 particulars of offence josefa biu on the DATE at suva in the central division had carnal knowledge of selei melita delana without her consent second count statement of offence unnatural offence contrary to section 175 a of the penal code act 17 particulars of offence josefa biu on the DATE at suva in the central division had carnal knowledge of selei melita delana against the order of nature the appellant pleaded guilty on both counts after electing magistrate s court trial on DATE he also agreed to the facts outlined by the prosecution the facts are these on DATE the complainant an 11 year old primary school student was sent to the accused s house to get cassava the accused gave the complainant s companion a cousin money to buy bread from the shop and he asked the complainant to wash his dishes he then called her into the house and told her to undress he then took his own clothes off and made the complainant lie on the floor the facts then read as follows the accused then laid on top of the complainant and tried to push his erect penis into her vagina the complainant struggled as she could feel the pain the accused then closed her mouth with his hands the accused was unable to penetrate into the complainant s vagina later he put his penis on the complainant s anus he then penetrated fully and ejaculated the facts as further outlined by the prosecution were that the complainant who was weeping throughout the encounter was then told by the appellant to wash herself she left the house and met her cousin returning from the shop when she arrived home her mother asked her why she was distressed whereupon the complainant related the incident to her the matter was reported to the police the complainant was medically examined and the appellant interviewed he admitted the offences and was charged the facts were admitted the appellant convicted as charged and was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment on count 1 and 5 years imprisonment on count 2 the appellant now appeals against sentence on the ground that it was harsh and excessive he submits that he had pleaded guilty that he has four children that the complainant was his niece his sister s daughter and that he had been told by the police that he would receive a suspended sentence at the hearing of the appeal state counsel conceded that there was a difficulty with count 1 although section 309 1 of the criminal procedure code prohibits appeals against convictions on a plea of guilty convictions may be set aside where they were not justified on the facts outlined in court see r v rollafson 1969 53 cr app r 389 in this case the prosecution said that the appellant was unable to penetrate into the complainant s vagina the medical report tendered shows that there was no penetration of the vagina but that it was possible that there was rectal penetration in the sentence delivered by the learned magistrate he said when he could not penetrate the accused then committed an unnatural offence on the victim there seems to be no doubt that there was no vaginal penetration rape is unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl or woman without her consent section 183 of the penal code defines carnal knowledge thus whenever upon the trial for any offence punishable under this code it may be necessary to prove carnal knowledge it shall not be necessary to prove actual omission of seed in order to constitute a carnal knowledge but the carnal knowledge shall be deemed complete upon proof of penetration only sections 149 and 183 of the penal code are silent on whether the prosecution must prove vaginal penetration as opposed to penetration of any other part of the body however the common law accepts rape as vaginal rape and the inclusion of the offence of carnal knowledge against the order of nature suggests that the penal code too intended such a restriction on the offence of rape in any event the prosecution clearly intended to prosecute in respect of two acts the attempted penetration of the complainant s vagina and the successful anal penetration the appellant was certainly sentenced on that basis unfortunately the learned magistrate did not take note of the fact that carnal knowledge is not proved unless penetration is proved and that the facts said that there was no vaginal penetration however the facts as agreed to clearly established an attempted rape section 170 of the criminal procedure code provides when a person is charged with an offence he may be convicted of having attempted to commit the offence although he was not charged with the attempt section 151 states any person who attempts to commit rape is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years with or without corporal punishment clearly the conviction of rape cannot stand the facts do not disclose the offence and the conviction is quashed the provisions of section 319 1 of the criminal procedure code provide that at the hearing of an appeal the high court may confirm reverse or vary the decision of the magistrate s court or may remit the matter with the opinion of the high court thereon to the magistrate s court or may order a new trial or may order trial by a court of competent jurisdiction or may make such order in the matter as it may seem just and may by such order exercise any power which the magistrate s court might have exercised these very wide powers given to the high court on a criminal appeal allow the court in effect to substitute a finding which the magistrate s court might have reached in this case it allows a substitution of a conviction of attempted rape for the conviction of rape the fiji court of appeal exercised this power in state v apolosa rainima fca 577 94 in that case the accused had been tried in the high court on a charge of rape the accused admitted to an attempt in the course of the trial however the alternative opinion of a conviction of the lesser offence of attempted rape was not put to the assessors and they returned an opinion of not guilty of rape on an appeal by the state the court of appeal held that a conviction on the accused s own evidence of attempted rape was justified set aside the acquittal and substituted a conviction for attempted rape the case was remitted to the high court for sentencing only in this appeal the appellant agreed to attempting to penetrate the medical report shows bruising with fresh bleeding around the vagina and superficial bruising the hymen was intact the doctor wrote in her report that it is possible that there was force used to have vaginal sex but there was no vaginal penetration the legal definition of an attempt is provided by section 380 of the penal code it is when a person intending to commit an offence begins to put his intention into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment and manifests his intention by some overt act but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence it is immaterial except so far as regards punishment whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention this definition of attempt is comparable to the common law definition of an attempt in england before the passing of the criminal attempts act 1981 the test was whether an act was more than merely preparatory and whether there was any further act on the defendant s part remaining to be done before the completion of the crime r v eagleton 1855 dears 515 lord diplock in r v stonehouse 1977 2 all er 909 said the constituent elements of the inchoate crime of an attempt are a physical act by the offender sufficiently proximate to the complete offence and an intention on the part of the offender to commit the complete offence acts that are merely preparatory to the commission of the offence are not sufficiently proximate to constitute an attempt they do not indicate a fixed irrevocable intention to go on to commit the complete offence unless involuntarily prevented from doing so the court of appeal in apolosa rainima supra accepted this to be the test for an attempt under section 380 of the penal code applying that test the appellant should clearly have been convicted of an attempted rape he tried to penetrate the vagina but was unable to do so he then proceeded to have anal intercourse the offence being clear on the admitted facts i therefore substitute a conviction of attempted rape for the conviction of rape on count 1 i consider that section 309 allows the court to reconsider the matter of sentence in this appeal the appellant has repeated the mitigation he made in the magistrate s court and has expressed remorse in re considering sentence the high court can impose a sentence which the magistrate might have imposed within the jurisdiction of the magistrate s court sentence the maximum sentence for rape is life imprisonment the maximum sentence for attempted rape is seven years imprisonment the maximum sentence for unnatural offence is fourteen years imprisonment the appellant has a number of previous convictions some involving violence he is a 35 year old man with four children he said that he and his sister the complainant s mother have now reconciled in the traditional way and that he had four children to look after he expressed remorse counsel for the state said that the complainant was an 11 year old child who had trusted her uncle the appellant he said that the medical report showed that the psychological trauma of the incident might never heal and that the public abhorred offences against children he said that a 5 year term for the unnatural offence was justified because of the gravity of the offence the need to protect children and the need to deter would be child abusers the starting point for rape is seven years imprisonment the magistrate s court appear to pass sentences of five years imprisonment for rape unless there are exceptional mitigating circumstances they are limited of course by jurisdiction to five years imprisonment however given the maximum sentence for attempted rape i consider that four years imprisonment might be a logical starting point that point would then be increased if there was aggravating features or reduced if there were mitigating factors aggravating factors would be the violence of the attempt any relationship of particular trust between the accused and the complainant the youth or age of the complainant children and older women being particularly vulnerable any disability suffered by the complainant and any psychological trauma suffered by her mitigating factors would be a plea of guilty any expression of remorse any attempt to make reparation for the harm done and the accused s antecedent history in this case there were many aggravating factors the appellant abused his position of trust and tried to rape his own niece the complainant was only 11 years old the facts outline her extreme distress while the offence was being committed the medical report shows physical injury and severe psychological trauma she may never recover from the latter clearly the mitigating circumstances are less than impressive the appellant pleaded guilty this saved the complainant from the additional trauma of giving evidence he has also expressed remorse and has reconciled with his sister unhappily such reconciliation cannot help the complainant in her recovery after the attempted rape taking all these matters into account i consider the four year term imposed by the learned magistrate for rape to be more appropriate for an attempted rape although the violence of the attack and the relationship between the appellant and the child might have warranted a much higher term i have given considerable discount for the plea of guilty i also note that the appellant has no previous convictions for acts of sexual violence for these reasons i consider a term of four years imprisonment appropriate on count 1 and i sentence the appellant accordingly on count 2 i consider the sentence of five years imprisonment appropriate although the appellant might have received considerably more if he had been sentenced in the high court in stephen peter jones 1991 92 cr app r 288 the english court of appeal considered the appropriate sentences for sexual offending against children in that case the court held that the appropriate sentence for buggery with children was six years imprisonment in maleli qiladrau crim app no 48 2000 pathik j considered a sentence of 4½ years imprisonment to be appropriate for unnatural offence with a boy in the circumstances i consider the five year term on count 2 entirely appropriate furthermore looking at the totality of the sentence a total of nine years imprisonment i also consider that a consecutive sentence reflects the gravity of the offending the abhorrence that the public holds for the offences and the public interest in passing a deterrent sentence in offences against children for these reasons the sentences are to run consecutively the conviction on count 1 is quashed and is substituted with a conviction for attempted rape the sentence of four years imprisonment is imposed on count 1 the sentence of five years remains for count 2 both sentences are to be served consecutively nazhat shameem judge at suva DATE haa0085j 00s paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,1,2360
270322,judgment calanchini p 1 i have had the opportunity to read in draft the judgments of both jayasuria ja and madigan ja and agree with their reasons and their conclusion that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed jayasuriya ja introduction 2 the appellant was charged with seven counts in the first and the fourth counts he was charged with rape second third and the fifth counts were for the offence of indecent assault and the sixth and seventh counts were for sexual assault 3 these seven counts reflect a series of incidents of sexual abuse spanning over a period of nine years the first of these incidents had taken place between DATE and DATE on that occasion the appellant had committed rape on the victim who was six years old the appellant who is the step grandfather of the victim was forty five years old when he committed the first offence of rape 4 the appellant pleaded guilty to all seven counts and was convicted accordingly 5 this appeal is against the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge 6 following sentences were imposed on the appellant count 1 rape 13 years imprisonment count 2 indecent assault 2 years imprisonment count 3 indecent assault 2 years imprisonment count 4 rape 13 years imprisonment count 5 indecent assault 2 years imprisonment count 6 sexual assault 4 years imprisonment count 7 sexual assault 4 years imprisonment 7 all these sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently making a total sentence of 13 years imprisonment a non parole period of 12 years imprisonment was also ordered 8 the trial judge had taken into account a series of mitigating factors as well as aggravating factors in arriving at the periods of imprisonment reflected above 9 appellant challenges the sentence on two grounds they are remand period of 1 year and 1 month 15 days has not been deducted from the interim total as a separate factor the trial judge had failed to indicate the discount given for the guilty plea failure to deduct the remand period 10 it was submitted that the appellant spent 1 year 1 month and 15 days period in remand pending trial in this case the state did not dispute this fact 11 the sentencing order of DATE reflects that the learned trial judge had taken into account the period the appellant spent in remand as one of the mitigating factors in arriving at the final term of imprisonment 12 section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 requires a court to regard any period of time during which the offender was held in custody pending trial as a period of imprisonment already served by an accused person however a court in its discretion can order otherwise 13 on behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the trial judge did not satisfy this requirement as he failed to consider the time the appellant spent in custody pending trial as a separate factor and make a specific deduction equal to such period of time in determining the term of imprisonment imposed on the appellant 14 the state conceded that the trial judge should have made a separate downward adjustment to the sentence according to the time spent in custody and therefore contravened section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 15 state moved this court to pass a sentence warranted by law as provided under section 23 3 of the court of appeal act cap 12 discount for guilty plea 16 the next ground urged on behalf of the appellant is that the trial judge failed to quantify the discount that had been given to the guilty plea but had subsumed this factor as a part of mitigation in arriving at the final term of imprisonment imposed on the appellant 17 the appellant relies on naikelekelevesi v the state 2008 fjca 11 aau 0061 2007 DATE where it was observed that where there is a guilty plea this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factor in a case 18 on behalf of the state it was submitted that the trial judge in fact had taken into account the guilty plea and its favourable consequences to the victim in determining the sentence however in response to a question posed by this court the counsel for the state submitted that a reduction of around 15 from the overall sentence would meet ends of justice in this case if the reduction is to be quantified and set out as a separate factor determination 19 sentencing of offenders is an integral and important part of the administration of criminal justice process when statutes have set out different levels of punishment to different offences it leaves a broad discretion on a court to determine the exact type and the level of punishment that will be imposed in a given situation 20 sentencing and penalties decree 2009 sets out broad guidelines on sentencing as well as specific requirements that need to be adhered to in imposing sentences of imprisonment 21 section 4 1 of the decree supra identifies inter alia following purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences 22 section 4 2 of the decree supra recognizes several factors a court must have regard to in sentencing offenders they include whether the offender pleaded guilty or not the stage at which such plea was entered if he had pleaded guilty and whether the offenders conduct is an indication of remorse or lack of remorse this section also recognizes the impact of an offence on any victim as a factor a court must give due regard to in deciding on the sentence in a given situation 23 in khan v the state 2014 fjca 92 aau 105 20 DATE it was observed the sentencing and penalties decree has left it to the decision of the sentencing court to give an appropriate weight to a guilty plea when sentencing an offender 24 while making the above observation the court further opined that naikelekelevesis case was considered before the sentencing and penalties decree came into effect in 2010 the sentencing and penalties decree has not endorsed the naikelekelevesi principle 25 the trial judge in this case had observed the following a you pleaded guilty to the charges although this was approximately 1 year 1 month after the first call in the high court consequently you have saved the courts time and avoided the need for the complainant to relive her ordeal in the court room by giving evidence b it appears you are remorseful and as a result you have voluntarily admitted your guilt on all the offences 26 the trial judge had taken these factors relating to the guilty plea into his account in determining the sentence despite he has subsumed these factors among the other factors that were considered as mitigating factors 27 similarly the trial judge has taken into account the remand period of the appellant also as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence 28 therefore the issues this court in exercising its appellate jurisdiction has to resolve are whether the trial judge has failed to comply with the statutory requirements set out in the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 and if so whether such failure had occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant this court will further examine whether a different sentence should have been passed taking into account all the facts and circumstances of this case including any errors of law or fact of the trial court 29 in determining these issues i am more inclined to engage in an assessment keeping in mind the broader principles of sentencing statutorily recognised as sentencing guidelines in section 4 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 rather than converting its process to applying a series of mathematical equations 30 it is also pertinent to note that the trial judge in determining the sentence in this case has used 11 years as a starting point which is towards the lower end of the accepted tariff for a case of this nature committing rape on a child victim the supreme court in raj v the state 2014 fjsc 12 cav 0003 2014 DATE approved 10 16 years imprisonment as the correct tariff for the rape of a child 31 therefore the starting point of 11 years for the offence of rape in this case is well within the lawful tariff for a case of child rape 32 in this case the appellant who is the step grandfather of the victim abused his position of trust and command in abusing the victim for a continuous period of nearly nine years when the first incident of penile penetration occurred the victim was 6 year old child it had not been an isolated incident but the beginning of a series of continued abuse the conduct of the appellant converted the safest place for the victim her home to the most dangerous place in this world 33 the victim impact statement admitted in the trial court reflects that the victim has shown a lot of changes in life style for a young girl of her age the trauma she had gone through during the incident had affected her mentally physically she feels like to be isolated all the times lack of concentration having nightmare and slow to respond 34 i observe that the final sentence of 13 years that had been imposed on the appellant for two counts of rape still remain towards the lower end of the lawful tariff 35 in arriving at this final figure the following deductions had been made by the trial judge taking into account several mitigating factors offences of rape 5 years offences of indecent assault 2 years offences of sexual assault 2 years 36 the factors other than the time spent in remand custody and factors relating to the guilty plea that were taken into account by the trial judge are as follows the appellant was a 55 year old married person with no children the appellant reached class 6 education and the appellant had not committed any offence for the last 10 years and this is his first sexual offending 37 furthermore i am of the view that the factors a and b above will have an insignificant impact as mitigating factors in a case of this nature it is the marriage between the appellant and the victims grandmother which gave the opportunity to the appellant to commit this series of sexual assaults on the six year old victim the appellant had totally disregarded and ignored the moral responsibilities that are attached to a marital relationship more particularly the responsibility to care and foster their descendants a more humane and responsible conduct is expected from a middle aged man the fact that the appellant received formal education only up to class 6 cannot mitigate the legal consequences attached to his immoral conduct 38 therefore the deduction of 5 years for the offence of rape in this case can be reasonably accounted for the time spent in remand the guilty plea and the good behavior good character of the appellant 39 it is also pertinent to note that the trial judge had ordered terms of imprisonments imposed on all seven counts to operate concurrently making the total period of incarceration to 13 years 40 in raj supra the supreme court cited with approval and endorsed the following observation of the court of appeal rapes of juveniles under the age of 18 years must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years there can be no fault in the sentencing approach of the learned judge referred to above in paragraph 13 save as to say we do not consider that allowance should have been made for family circumstances to that extent the appellant was afforded leniency that he did not deserve 41 i am of the view that any further deductions to the 13 year sentence of imprisonment in this case will fail to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such action as well as will fail to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature 42 taking into account all these factors i am of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial court is lawful and this court should not intervene with it therefore pursuant to section 23 3 of the court of appeal act cap 12 the appeal is dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge is affirmed madigan ja 43 i have read in draft the judgment of jayasuriya j a and i would agree that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed given the very lenient sentence already passed on the appellant in the court below 44 i would however add the following paragraphs with regard to sentencing practice and pleas of guilty 45 although the judge passing sentence below took all matters complained of into consideration when assessing an appropriate global sentence it is better sentencing practice to specify terms of discount when allowing for such matters as pleas of guilty time on remand and clear record for example the convict and the reader can then see easily the various components of a sentence and sentence appeals could be prevented 46 discount for a plea of guilty should be the last component of a sentence after additions and deductions are made for aggravating and mitigating circumstances respectively it has always been accepted though not by authorative judgment that the high water mark of discount is one third for a plea willingly made at the earliest opportunity this court now adopts that principle to be valid and to be applied in all future proceedings at first instance 47 pleas of guilty made at later stages than earliest opportunity cause more difficulties in the assessment of how much discount should be afforded to them it is not for this court to suggest an appropriate sliding scale because it must remain a matter of judicial discretion we would however make three points very clear in this regard i a plea of guilty before trial must be afforded some discount given that the cost of trial including time and cost of assessors is saved ii a plea of guilty at a later stage before a trial involving a vulnerable witness must be given a meaningful discount say 20 25 to recognize the fact that the vulnerable witness is not put through the ordeal of giving evidence iii a plea during trial after an accused has heard unshakeable evidence of a victim complainant or after an inculpatorycaution interview has been admitted into evidence is not deserving of any discount whatsoever the orders of the court are the sentence of the high court dated DATE is affirmed appeal is

251854,ruling 1 the appellant was charged with digital rape of a juvenile girl following a trial in the high court at suva the three assessors gave their opinions that the appellant was not guilty of the charge the trial judge disagreed and in a written judgment convicted the appellant of rape and sentenced him to 9 years 11 months and 14 days imprisonment with a non parole period of 7 years 11 months and 14 days this is a timely application for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence pursuant to section 21 1 of the court of appeal act cap 12 the test for leave to appeal against conviction is whether the appeal is arguable naisua v state unreported cr app no cav0010 of 2013 DATE the test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether there is an arguable error in the sentencing discretion naisua v state unreported cr app no cav0010 of 2013 DATE 2 briefly the facts were that on DATE the appellant invited the victim to his home to baby sit his child the victim was 16 years old her mother dropped her off at the appellant s house in the morning occasionally the victim s parents did paid house chores for the appellant when the appellant returned home he went and sat beside the victim while the appellant s child was in the shower the appellant removed the victim s pants and the underwear and penetrated her vagina with his fingers without her consent as a result the victim s hymen was ruptured she managed to push the appellant away and at that point he got up and went away when the victim s mother returned in the afternoon to the appellant s house she observed that the victim was distressed when they returned to their home the victim told her mother that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant the matter was reported to police 3 counsel for the appellant advances the following grounds of appeal that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact by failing to consider the medical evidence which stated that the injury appeared to have occurred within 24 to 28 hours and the doctor further defining in his evidence under oath that he should have stated that the injury has occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination thereby implying that the injury was possibly 2 days old that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self inflicted therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the appellant who had caused the injuries to the complainant that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in not accepting that the injuries sustained could be self inflicted therefore there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the appellant who had caused the injuries to the complainant that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in not considering that had the appellant intended to commit the offence he could have chosen the more probable venues which were the 3 bedrooms in the house rather than choosing the sitting room to be fully exposed to the appellant s 10 year old daughter and an uninterrupted access to the daughter at anytime that the learned trial judge misdirected himself and contracted himself in accordance with the directions given in his summing up at paragraph 8 when assessing the testimony of a witness that the learned trial judged erred in law and fact in holding that the evidence given by the 2nd defence witness nisha neha bilash was not credible and that the demeanor at the time she gave evidence was not acceptable and failing to c consider the age of the witness at the time of giving evidence in that she was clearly facing the trial judge all the counsels the assessors and the appellant throughout the entire time that she gave evidence hence eye contact with the appellant could not be avoided at the material time and further that she gave clear answers to the questions asked and also that similar type of demeanor was portrayed by the doctor when she gave evidence in that there were long pauses before he answered the questions and he took longer time to give h is answers despite being a professional and deemed to have sufficient knowledge of the injuries in question and who looked down most of the time at the time of answering questions that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding that the evidence of the complainant was credible when he failed to consider that there were several inconsistencies in her evidence in court compared to the information that she gave to police and the she gave to the medical doctor failure to direct himself on previous inconsistent statement in law of the complainant cause substantial miscarriage of justice that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in accepting the evidence of the complainant when she said in re examination that the reason she did not tell the police about the appellant kissing her breast was because she was scared and ashamed when it ought to hold that such an explanation was least probable in light of fact that she was without any hesitation able to tell the police about the alleged penetration in her vagina by the appellant and therefore the complainant s version of the whole situation ought not be believed that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in holding the complainant as a credible witness and not taking into account that on one hand the complainant gave evidence that the appellant had forced her pants down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down and held her tight and committed the offence whilst she was sitting down whilst on the other hand she admitted that her clothes buttons were not broken her clothes were still in good condition when her mother came to take her at 5 00 pm she did not have any bruises or marks over her hands or waist area and she did not shout even to raise alarm for neha nishika bilash to hear who was right inside the house or to the neighbours whose house were just 2 to 3 meters away that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in holding that the offence was committed by the appellant when the appellant s daughter was having her bath without any cogent proof evidence and not accepting the daughter s evidence when she said that she never went for a bath whilst the complainant was at their home between 4 00 pm to 5 00 pm that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not accepting the evidence given by the appellant without any cogent reasoning that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in holding that neha nishika bilash s evidence was inconsistent and unreliable when neha stated that she did not see her father put the bag on the dining table and taking out food and also when she said her father was still eating when the complainant s mother came whereas the appellant s version was that he had already eaten before the complainant s mother came and failing to consider that whatever happened in the kitchen was irrelevant and that the main issue was as to whether the incident as alleged by complainant occurred in the sitting room during that time the learned trial judge misdirected and contradicted himself in his summing up paragraphs 9 10 and 11 that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in overturning the unanimous decisions of the assessors of not guilty and failing to consider that the facts of the case and the evidence given by each of the witness clearly indicated that the complaint by the complainant was highly likely to be falsely made that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in misdirecting himself when he stated that i observed the demeanor of the complainant when she gave evidence i did not note any attempt by her to exaggerate in my view she gave honest answers relying only on the demeanor of the complainant and not whole evidence as a whole caused a substantial miscarriage of justice that the learned trial judge did not direct himself and take into consideration the evidence of the medical practitioner that there could be possibility that the complainant did not suffer any injuries as during the complainant s examination no injuries were found and as such there is possibility that no injury was caused to her that the learned trial judge did not consider analyze the defence case adequately or in detail in particular the evidence of the accused s daughter who was present in the room with the victim but did not see the appellant committing the offence as charged in the circumstances there was a substantial miscarriage of justice that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself when finding the appellant guilty that when the appellant was called at the police station he was not interviewed on the same day the police officers told the appellant that he would be interviewed later and despite the fact the appellant requested that it was getting late night and he requested the police officers to take the complainant for medical examination same night because he was concerned that the complainant will go and do something to herself and thereafter blame the appellant by not doing so there was a substantial miscarriage of justice as it created serious doubts of self inflicted injuries by the complainant that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in overruling the unanimous verdict of the assessors of not guilty did not give cogent reasons as to why he overruled the unanimous not guilty opinion of the three assessors in light of the whole of the evidence presented in the trial that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself that the prosecution evidence before the court proved beyond reasonable doubts that there were serious doubts in the prosecution case and as such the benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the appellant that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in commenting on the evidence raising a new theory on the facts uncanvassed during the course of the trial whereby the defence has had no opportunity of commenting upon it that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to refer any summing up the possible defence on evidence and as such by his failure there was a substantial miscarriage of justice that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not adequately sufficiently referring directing putting considering the appellant s case to the prosecutions and defence evidence that the learned trial judge while correctly directing the assessors in paragraph 5 of his summing up that you must not speculate about what evidence there might have been misdirected himself and erred in law and in fact in speculating when he stated in his judgment paragraph 26 that the defence counsel attempted to paint the picture that the complainant was poor she wears short and tight fittings and she made this complaint in order to claim money from the accused the unanimous in order opinion of the assessors that the accused is not guilty shows the defence counsel has in fact been successful in painting that picture in the minds of the assessors in my view that picture had prejudiced the assessors mind against the complainant and the assessors failed to comprehend that those facts are not relevant in deciding whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offence charged that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact by finding the appellant guilty of the offence charged contradicted himself in his summing up at paragraph 67 when he gave inter alia 3 options i you may believe his expectations and if you believe him then your opinion must be that the accused is not guilty ii without necessarily believing him you may think well what he says might be true if that is so it means that there is reasonable doubt in your mind and therefore again your opinion must be not guilty iii the third possibility is that you reject his evidence but if you disbelieve him that itself does not make him guilty of an offence charged the situation would then be the same as if he had not given any evidence at all you should still consider whether prosecution has proved all the elements beyond reasonable doubt if you are sure that the prosecution has proved all the elements then your proper opinion would be that the accused is guilty of the offence that despite the above directions the 3 assessors found the appellant not guilty and the learned trial judge by overturning their unanimous opinion of not guilty and without giving cogent reasons had caused a substantial miscarriage of justice that the appellant reserves the right to appeal such further and other grounds as the appellant may be advised upon the receipt of the court record appeal against sentence that the appellant relies on grounds 1 to 23 stated herein above that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in ordering a sentence of 9 years 11 months and 14 days with parole of 7 years 11 months and 14 days which is manifestly excessive and failed to consider that the facts of the case were not so grave as to amount to a harsh and severe penalty that the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in considering that the police officer had cooperated with the appellant in allowing him more time during the investigation process when it ought to have considered that it was the appellant who had cooperated with police for some 10 months that was since the date of the complaint until the time the appellant was charged by police and therefore this factor ought to be considered as a ground for mitigation whilst passing the sentence that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the appellant and not taking into relevant consideration that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 when he passed the sentence against the appellant 4 at the hearing both parties relied upon their respective written submissions unfortunately a substantial part of the appellant s submissions deal with the test for leave to appeal without making submissions on each ground of appeal counsel for the appellant submits that the grounds are arguable and have strong prospects of success for leave and bail to be granted 5 the victim was medically examined a day after the alleged incident the examining doctor found that the victim s hymen was ruptured the doctor s opinion was that the injury had occurred within the last 48 hours from the time of the examination the doctor said that the injury could have been caused by a penis finger or a foreign object penetrating the vagina vigorously the doctor also said that there was a possibility that the injury could be self inflicted but it would be very painful the learned trial judge fairly summarized the medical evidence in his summing up at the end of the day the medical evidence did not implicate the appellant the learned trial judge convicted the appellant because he believed the victim was telling the truth when she said the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his fingers grounds one two three and fourteen are unarguable 6 grounds four and sixteen are speculative and unarguable 7 there is no contradiction in the manner in which the learned trial judge dealt with the testimony of the appellant s daughter in paragraphs 12 13 and 23 of the judgment the learned trial judge gave reasons why he chose not to give much weight to the evidence of the appellant s daughter grounds five nine eleven and fifteen are unarguable 8 the inconsistencies in the evidence of the victim were dealt in the summing up and in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the judgment the learned trial judge did not find the inconsistencies material he found the victim to be a credible witness despite the inconsistencies grounds six seven and eight are unarguable 9 the learned trial judge dealt with the appellant s evidence in paragraphs 11 and 20 of the judgment the learned trial judge gave cogent reasons for not believing the appellant s evidence ground ten is unarguable 10 the learned trial judge gave detailed reasons for not accepting the opinions of the assessors the reasons given for convicting the appellant are cogent i think both the summing up and the judgment are impeccable grounds twelve and seventeen to twenty three are unarguable 11 the learned trial judge did not misdirect when he found the victim to be an honest witness based on her demeanour when she gave evidence ground thirteen is unarguable 12 the sentence of 9 years 11 months and 14 days for rape of a juvenile girl in a contested case is on the lower end of the tariff for rape raj v state unreported cav003 2014 DATE the learned trial judge s assessment of the aggravating and mitigating factors was correct i am not convinced that there is an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion 13 for these reasons i refuse leave to appeal against conviction and sentence 14 the test for bail pending appeal

72073,judgment this is an appeal against sentence in respect of a term of three years and four months imprisonment imposed on the appellant for the following charge statement of offence attempted rape contrary for section 151 of the penal code act 17 particulars of offence jioji aunima on the DATE at nasinu in the central division attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of raijieli akanisi without her consent the appeal was against conviction and sentence but at the hearing of the appeal counsel proceeded with the appeal against sentence only the facts of the case as outlined by the prosecution were that on the DATE at about 7 30pm the victim was on her way to visit her cousin when she met the appellant he told her he know of a pastor on khalsa road who sold second hand clothes she accompanied him and when they passed a vacant house the appellant grabbed her and forced her to lie on the ground he then pulled her panties down to her knees she yelled out and a fijian man passing by came to her rescue he took the appellant to the police station where he admitted committing the offence these facts were admitted by the appellant in the magistrate s court and he was convicted as charged in mitigation he said he was 25 years old married had one son and was employed as a carpenter at falekau industries he expressed remorse and asked for a non custodial sentence he has one previous conviction on DATE for larceny in his sentence remarks the learned magistrate said the maximum sentence for attempted rape was 7 years imprisonment and that the starting point should therefore be 5 years imprisonment the appellant was given one third discount for the guilty plea and the sentence passed was therefore three years and four months imprisonment at the hearing of this appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that the starting point of five years imprisonment was wrong in principle he said that the tariff for attempted rape in fiji was considerable less than five years and suggested that the correct starting point should have been twenty one months as it was in vereniki marawa v the state criminal appeal no 018 of 1998 state counsel opposed the appeal saying that vereniki marawa supra was distinguishable and that because this was a serious case of attempted rape the starting point of five years imprisonment was right in principle a tariff sentence is usually passed where the court recognises the need to deterrent sentence the range of sentences that make up the tariff for a particular offence is usually determined by the courts the maximum statutory sentence is not always a good indication of what the tariff might be because the legislature often sets a statutory maximum far in excess of an appropriate term in order to give the court a wide discretion for sentencing in most case the statutory maximum sentence would only be appropriate for the worst type of offending the range of sentence which indicate the tariff is easily discernable from the reported cases for a particular type of offending the decision for the sentence is then to decide on the appropriate starting point d a thomas principles of sentencing says at page 38 this process is governed primarily by concepts of proportion the relative seriousness of the offence as an instance of its kind and arguments based on deterrence are not permitted to override this factor what may be considered the average offence of its kind is place near the middle of the range as in the case of statutory maxima room must be left within the effective range to deal with the most serious examples likely to be encountered in the absence of guideline judgments which set out the tariff for particular types of offending it is not always easy to recognize the tariff established by the courts this is because much of the sentencing which is done in the magistrate s courts is not always available to the high court or the court of appeal in this case both counsel have submitted those authorities they were able to obtain and they are useful as an indication of a tariff for attempted rape in vereniki marawa v the state supra surman j quashed a suspended sentence passed by a magistrate on appeal by the state and substituted a term of twelve months imprisonment he adopted a starting point of twenty one months imprisonment saying that the case was not the most serious of its kind indeed in outlining the facts which were that the accused had accosted and 18 year old girl pressed her neck pulled down his pants said he wanted to have sex with her his lordship said that the case was really a borderline case of attempted rape he said it was arguable that the accused should really have been charged with indecent assault in latchman prasad sharma v the state criminal appeal no 0027 of 1997 pain j considered a sentence of 4 years imprisonment for attempted rape after a defending hearing the evidence was that the victim was 12 years old the appellant had tried to penetrate her vagina but could not and he performed other degrading acts on her there was an element of breach of trust and some subterfuge employed by the appellant he had previous convictions for similar offences pain j refused to reduce the sentence saying at page 6 substantial prison sentences are common for this offence sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment have been confirmed in this court in epeli ratabacaca v the state crim app no 106 of 1991 and watisoni davui v the state crim app no 10 of 1997 in watisoni davui v the state supra the appellant had punched the victim taken her to a cassava patch thrown her to the ground assaulted her again and pulled down her pants before getting on top of her he was sentenced after a defended hearing to 3 ½ years imprisonment pain j upheld the sentence saying there was only a fine line between the attempt and the completed offence he said that 3 ½ years imprisonment was within the acceptable range in epeli ratabacaca v the state supra a sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment for attempted rape was upheld by jayaratne j on appeal from a defended hearing the facts of the case are not set out in the judgment but the charge was originally one of rape and the appellant was a first offender counsel also referred to english authorities on sentences for attempted rape however the tariff in england is not strictly comparable because the statutory maximum sentence for attempted rape is life imprisonment under section 3 schedule 2 para 1 a of the sexual offences act 1985 however the guidelines issued by the court of appeal in r v billam 82 cr app r 347 are helpful as to what factors may constitute aggravating or mitigation factors aggravating factors are 1 violence used over and above the force necessary to commit the offence 2 the use of weapons 3 repeated rapes 4 planning 5 previous convictions for sexual offences 6 the victim was subjected to further sexual indignities 7 the victim was very old or very young 8 the trauma suffered and the effect on the victim was especially serious mitigation features include 1 previous good character 2 guilty plea it was held in billam that the starting point for attempted rape should normally be less that for the completed offence especially if the offender was stopped at an early stage however in some cases the sentence for attempted rape could be heavier that some examples of the completed offence thus in r v behich 1986 8 cr app r s 387 a sentence of seven years imprisonment for attempted rape was upheld where there was a serious degree of violence in r v williams 1987 9 cr app r s 491 on facts similar to this case before me a sentence of five years imprisonment was reduced to four years applying all these principles i find that the accepted tariff for attempted rape in the fiji courts ranges from 12 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment a starting point should then be chosen according to the seriousness of the offending in the case before me a starting point of 5 years imprisonment was not appropriate this was not the most serious offence of its kind there was no evidence of injuries extreme youth or age of the victim or of the use of weapons or gratuitous violence however it was clearly not the least serious of its kind which might have justified the lowest starting point the appellant used subterfuge to lure the victim to a vacant house he deliberately referred to a pastor to gain her confidence he would have completed the offence if he had not been disturbed and he used force to get the victim to lei down pulling her panties down to her knees this was not a borderline indecent assault as such i consider a starting point of 4 years imprisonment to be appropriate the appellant was entitled to a reduction for his guilty plea of one year but was not entitled to any further reduction for good character in all the circumstances i consider a sentence of 3 years imprisonment to be appropriate the sentence of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment is quashed and substituted with a term of 3 years imprisonment the appeal is successful to that extent nazhat shameem judge at suva DATE hac0033j 01s paclii copyright

code cap 17 particulars of offence afzal khan s o shamsher khan on the DATE at nadi in the western division wrongfully confined a girl namely selai sinukula the facts as they appear from the record of the magistrates court were that the appellant was employed at the complainant s school that the complainant got into the appellant s motor vehicle and that he took her ultimately to wailoaloa beach without her permission instead of taking her to her home that at the beach the appellant kissed her on the lips once and touched her thighs that he put her dress up and stated that she looked beautiful at the time of the commission of the offences the complainant was a class 3 student and 10 years of age there is no suggestion in the facts as found by the learned magistrate that there was any touching on the genitals or any penetration the medical report tendered before the learned magistrate confirms that there was in fact no apparent penetration or physical injury to the complainant the learned magistrate sentenced the appellant to a period of 2 years imprisonment with respect to the indecent assault and 12 months imprisonment with respect to the wrongful confinement and then ordered that the sentences be served consecutively resulting in a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment the appellant appeals to this court against the sentences imposed upon him the tariff for the offence of indecent assault was considered by madam justice shameem in josateki seru v the state criminal appeal no haa0050 of 2003s her ladyship reiterated what she said to penioni ratoto v the state in criminal appeal no haa0068 of 2002s the principles there set out are sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years the gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence the indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence the nature of the assault whether it was penetrative whether gratuitous violence was use whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated all reflect on the gravity of the offence mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence these are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the penal code generally the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases a five year sentence may be appropriate a non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar and the assault of a non penetrative and fleeting type because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault it is difficult to refer to any more specific guideline than these as i have already indicated the facts as found by the learned magistrate made it clear that there was indeed no penetration in the assault affected by the appellant nor was there any violence or weapons of any type used the victim however is a child of 10 years of age and this in itself is an aggravation the appellant was entitled to no discount before the learned magistrate for entering a plea of guilty as the matter proceeded by way of defended hearing and of course he is not to be the subject of any additional penalty because he chose to defend the matter it would appear that the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years is within the range and certainly is not manifestly excessive or wrong at law such as to warrant this court interfering with it similarly the sentence of 12 months imposed with respect with the wrongful confinement is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle such as with warrant this court interfering with it the learned magistrate did however order that the sentences be served consecutively the facts as found by the learned magistrate clearly indicate that both offences were committed at the same time and that it was all part of the one event in these circumstances the sentencing guidelines are clear that sentences for offences which are all part of the one incident should be served concurrently and accordingly the order of the court will be 1 appeal is allowed 2 sentence of the learned magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years imprisonment is confirmed 3 sentence of the learned magistrate with respect to wrongful confinement of 12

counts the accused admitted that he penetrated the complainants vagina with his penis this in itself is sufficient to ground a conviction for rape against a child since a child under 13 years is incapable as a matter of law of giving her consent and by penetrating the childs vagina with his penis an accused is presumed to know that a child is incapable of giving her consent at the time of sexual intercourse 8 on the indecent assault charges ie count nos 2 3 and 5 the accused admitted that he sucked and licked the complainants vagina at the material times and in the case of count no 2

79539,judgment of the court the appellant appeared before the suva magistrates court on DATE charged with five counts of rape the particulars showed that the victim in each case was the same person and that the charges covered a period from december 19 DATE the appellant elected summary trial and pleaded guilty to all charges when the facts were presented to the court by the prosecution it became apparent that the victim was the accused s daughter the rapes started when she was only 13 years old the victim had been threatened and subjected to physical violence on one occasion the appellant had taken her to a hotel to commit the offence and he had obtained her silence by a threat to kill her if she told anyone the offences came to light when her mother noticed that she looked as if she may be pregnant and the victim disclosed the rapes and the identity of her attacker a medical examination confirmed that she was a week over seven months pregnant the only indication in the original charges which might have alerted the court to the fact that the victim was the appellant s daughter was that the victim had the same family name as the accused the appellant admitted the facts that had been outlined and also admitted two minor convictions both of which were more than 20 years old having passed in a copy of the appellant s antecedent history the prosecutor applied to the magistrate to commit the case to the high court for sentencing under section 222 1 of the criminal procedure code at that stage the magistrate indicated that he would hear the application after the appellant had mitigated once that was done and following further submissions by the prosecutor the magistrate s notes recorded inter alia 1 i will first rule on the prosecution application to refer this matter to the high court for sentencing under section 222 1 of the criminal procedure code 2 i thank the prosecution for referring this court to the various authorities cited in the record all those authorities are binding in this case however in my view the court of appeal case of timoci momotu v state is crucial for the success or otherwise of the state s application 4 of importance is the requirement that this court must consider his character and antecedents of the accused supplied by the state this is to be an added inquiry separate from his circumstances and gravity of the offences to which the accused has pleaded guilty to 6 the antecedent of the accused supplied to the court by the prosecution does not entitle me to refer this matter to the high court for sentencing 7 the antecedent of the accused appears to show that he is a first offender as far as sexual offences are concerned 8 if the prosecution had wanted a penalty more than that allowed by the magistrates court they should have used their powers under section 220 of the cpc at the outset 9 it is not safe given the legal difficulties presented by timoci momotu to rely on section 222 1 of the cpc when the antecedent of the accused does not satisfy the test laid out in that case 12 the facts of this case is very disturbing the accused has seriously abused his right as a parent he has seriously abused the trust his daughter placed in him he has in effect ruined his family he then sentenced the appellant 4 years imprisonment on count 1 5 years consecutive on count 2 and 5 years concurrent on the remaining counts giving a total of 9 years the state appealed against conviction and sentence and the appeal was heard by justice shameem on conviction the learned judge considered the the state v timoci momotu crim app aau18 94 and the authorities cited she then concluded turning therefore to the case before me the learned magistrate held that the respondent was of good character and that the committal was not justified i do not consider that he erred in ignoring the two previous convictions for the respondent they are more than 20 years old and were rightly disregarded however i consider that he did err in disregarding the fact that respondent had raped his daughter which was not alleged in the charge and that the respondent had committed other offences of rape against his daughter which were not specified in the charges according to the authorities i have cited these factors were additional to the facts disclosed in the offences charged and were both relevant to the discretion to commit given the starting point for rape which is 7 years imprisonment the gravity of the offence including the resulting pregnancy of the complainant would have justified a significant increase any reduction for the guilty plea could not have brought the sentence within the jurisdiction on one count of the magistrates court further the relationship between the respondent and the complainant and the on going nature of the offending in relation to incidents not alleged in the charges should have led to committal for sentence i therefore find that the learned magistrate erred in failing to take into account factors relating to character and antecedents and in refusing the state s application to commit to the high court for sentence the learned judge then quashed the decision by the magistrate not to commit to the high court for sentence and substituted such an order the appellant was unrepresented before this court he had put in written submissions which related to sentence only we shall return to those when dealing with sentence however his grounds suggest he does not understand the procedure that was followed and so we have reviewed the decision of the learned high court judge on appeal we are satisfied that the learned judge s conclusions were correct the effect of the requirement in section 222 1 of the criminal procedure code that if on obtaining information as to the accused s character and antecedents the magistrate is of opinion that they are such that greater punishment should be inflicted in respect of the offence than the magistrate has power to inflict was extensively discussed in momotu s case the court cited the case of r v king s lynn justices ex parte carter and others 1968 3 all er 858 in which lord parker cj stated at 862 as i see it the expression character and antecedents being as wide as it possibly can be justices are entitled to take into consideration in deciding whether or not to commit not merely previous convictions not merely offences which they are asked to take into consideration but matters revealed in the course of the case connected with the offence charged which reflects in any way on the accused s character the majority in momotu considered that the sole reason for the magistrate s decision to commit for sentence in that case was the gravity of the offence dillon ja differed from the majority in finding that the gravity of the offence also provided information relating the character of the offender we agree that some facts may in a particular case point both to the gravity of the offence and to the character of the offender in the present case the learned judge clearly formed that conclusion the fact the rapes were committed on his own daughter that she was a child at the time that there were more instances than were actually charged that they resulted in her becoming pregnant that he was willing to use violence to facilitate the rapes and threats to procure her silence all supply information about the character of the appellant what was not apparent in the charges the decision of the learned judge to quash the magistrates order and commit the case to the high court for sentence was clearly correct when the case was brought up for sentence the learned judge referred to the guidelines in mohammed kasim v the state crim app 21 93 and sentenced the appellant in the following terms taking 7 years as the starting point i increase that term by two years for the young age of the complainant and a further 3 years for the fact that she is your daughter i add a further year for the resulting pregnancy i reduce the term by one year for the guilty plea and other mitigation she then sentenced the appellant to 12 years imprisonment on each court concurrent this court can only alter that sentence if it is manifestly excessive or wrong in law the appellant had placed a letter before the high court from his family pleading for a non custodial sentence he submitted a further letter each from the complainant and from his wife they repeat in strong terms their need for the appellant to be free to provide for his family and point out the suffering his incarceration will have on the family members no court could fail to be moved by such letters but the duty of the court is to pass a sentence for the offence that is appropriate to its gravity it must consider all matters that may mitigate the penalty but the consequences of the sentence on the accused man s family cannot be properly taken into account clearly the learned judge would have been affected by that plea it is impossible not to feel sympathy for the plight of the family as a result of a custodial sentence and to realise that the effect of the sentence will inevitably in a case such as this cause great hardship to the victim also we also bear that in mind but in view of the guidelines in mohammed kasim we cannot say that the sentence was manifestly excessive in one aspect of the sentence however we do consider the learned judge erred it has long been the practice of the courts to reduce a sentence where the accused person has pleaded guilty in most cases that is a recognition of his contrition as expressed by an early admission and the fact that it will save the witnesses and the court a great deal of time and expense in offences of a sexual nature the amount of reduction is generally more because the plea saves the victim from having to attend the trial and relive her experience in the witness box the learned trial judge as had the magistrate indicated that the sentence was reduced as a result of the plea of guilty by one year in this case the learned judge was right to pass a sentence well above the starting point suggested in mohammed kasim and the total sentence arrived at was as we have stated unchallengeable the facts of this case suggest that the appellant had little choice but to plead guilty and so the reduction such a plea would earn would not be as great as in many other cases however we feel that a reduction of one thirteenth does not adequately reflect the fact that his daughter was saved from having to give evidence we feel that a reduction of approximately one sixth would reflect that more accurately and to that extent only do we feel the learned judge s decision should be changed the appeal against sentence is allowed to the extent that the sentence is reduced to one of 11 years on each count to be served concurrently before leaving this case we would make a further observation in a case where the accused has elected to be tried summarily the court should always be careful as the facts unfold to bear in mind the possibility that the offences are too serious for him to be able to pass an adequate sentence if he does he has the power at any stage to stop trying the case and to continue as a preliminary inquiry the prosecutor has the right to require the case to be tried in the high court if he makes an application to that effect before the commencement of the trial the prosecutor will know better than the magistrate the nature and seriousness of the offence and should always be prepared to make such an application in an appropriate case if there is any doubt the magistrate should be given the full facts before he makes a decision whether or not to proceed summarily in this case the prosecutor should have done so once he had let it proceed to trial his ability to seek a committal for sentence under section 222 1 could have been restricted by the terms of the section quillam and thompson jja made this clear in momotu s case in the present case it must have become apparent to the magistrate in the course of the trial if not sooner that this was the kind of case in which the maximum sentence of 5 years was unlikely to be sufficient and particularly in view of the observations of this court made a few months earlier that the starting point for sentencing for rape should now be 7 years see mohammed kasim v state fca no 21 of 1993 delivered DATE no doubt there may still be cases in which a term of 5 years or less will be appropriate but they are likely to be increasingly rare we should also expect the prosecution to give closer attention to whether a rape trial should take place in the magistrates court or the high court while the charge must first be filed in the magistrates court it is open to the prosecution under s 220 to apply at once for a preliminary inquiry the prosecution will be aware of the nature of the evidence to be offered and we consider that a deliberate decision should be made in each case to whether the case is one which is likely to attract a sentence of more than 5 years in view of what we have already said we consider a decision to accept summary trial of a rape charge should rarely be made we would suggest that all rape cases should be tried in the high court the reduction from the basic sentence needed to bring it within the magistrate s jurisdiction is such that it will only be inappropriate in the most unusual case where the likelihood of committal to the high court for sentence is so great it is unfair to the accused to start to hear the case summarily and so before embarking on such a trial the magistrate should make careful inquiry of the prosecution as to the details of the case reddy p ward ja davies ja solicitors appellant in person

DATE at suva in the central division attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman namely fania seru without her consent second count statement of offence common assault contrary to section

he was sentenced to a total of 2 years imprisonment he now appeals against conviction and sentence the grounds of appeal are that there was no corroboration of the evidence of the complainant the medical report on its own was inadequate to convict the appellant and the state failed to properly lead the evidence the case was first called on the DATE the appellant pleaded not guilty on both counts there were numerous adjournments to allow legal aid counsel to appear and also for the non appearance of witnesses the trial commenced on the DATE the evidence of the complainant was that on the 23rd and DATE she was working at the dragon night club from 5pm to 3am she went to the birdland nightclub for half an hour with her work mates and then went home to nadera she took a short cut from the top shop in raiwaqa as she walked past the police post she saw the appellant on the porch he called out to her and asked her for cigarettes she said she had known the appellant for four years he was wearing a police uniform because he was a special constable she gave him cigarettes the record then reads as follows i gave him a roll of cigarettes when he held my hand this happened inside the police post when i went back to give him a roll of cigarette when he held my hand i told him rusi cava manati iko he replied tikolo madaga na gusumu lako mai ke he pulled me towards the porch there is a door to the wash room where he held me against the wall outside pulled up my skirt i called out rusi cava manati iko he replied tikolo na gusumu kua ni tovolea mo kaila de u na vacuki iko he then touched my private part he put me on the floor bending down and started to unbutton his trousers i pushed him and warned him at the same time that i shall report him to michael the father of my child a daughter when he heard of my warning he then released me she said that to touch her private parts the appellant had lifted her underwear she said she was distressed because she had always treated the appellant like a brother as she got up from the floor the appellant punched her she then complained about the incident to her brother apenisa seru who advised her to report the matter at the raiwaqa police station she did so two days later the appellant s wife came to her home seeking reconciliation the complainant chased her away the appellant was defended by counsel she said she was not certain of the exact time of the incident she said that before the incident she had drunk four glasses of rum and coke the prosecution called corporal sakiusa vunivesilevu of raiwaqa police station he said that on the DATE he received a report of attempted rape and indecent assault by fania seru he interviewed the appellant under caution the appellant told him that the complainant came to the police post at 5 22am she was drunk he made an entry about her arrival in the station diary he said that she spilt some water over the diary and that he asked her for a roll of cigarettes she gave him a roll she then started to fill an electric kettle with water apparently with the intention of throwing water over him he punched her on the mouth the kettle fell down he told her to leave the post she left but she came back to say that she would report him he denied trying to rape her or indecently assault her the trial continued on the DATE the complainant s brother was the next witness he said that on the DATE at 5 30am the complainant woke him up crying and told him that the appellant had tried to rape her at the police post that morning he told her to report the matter under cross examination he said he could see bruises on his sister s mouth and that she did not smell of alcohol police support officer jitendra singh gave evidence that he was on duty at the police post from 6 45am to 4pm on the 24th of february he said that when he took over from the appellant the appellant told him that he had slapped the complainant when she tried to put on the kettle and when she spilt water on the station diary the trial was then adjourned again and continued on the DATE the prosecution closed its case the appellant gave sworn evidence which was similar to his caution statement under cross examination he denied attempting to have sexual intercourse with the complainant however he also said that he did not assault her but that the kettle accidentally hit her mouth when he tried to slap her from throwing water on him judgment was delivered on the DATE after reviewing the evidence he said that an attempted rape is complete even if the perpetrator voluntarily desisted as long as there has been a proximate act he found that in this case the appellant s acts were sufficiently proximate on the basis of the evidence of the complainant and convicted him accordingly on both counts mitigation was heard on the DATE the appellant himself mitigated saying that he did not commit the offence and that he was a 29 year old married man with a child the learned magistrate sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment on count 1 and 9 months concurrent on count 2 the appeal the appellant says that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the complainant s evidence and that the convictions were therefore unsafe the court of appeal decision in seremaia balelala crim app aau0003 of 2004s has recently removed the necessity for giving a corroboration warning in cases of sexual assault this is because the law of corroboration was based on the discriminatory premise that the evidence of women in sexual cases is inherently unreliable thus there was no need to look for corroboration of the complainant s evidence clearly the learned magistrate accepted the complainant s evidence it is unfortunate that he did not explain why he preferred her evidence over the appellant s but the way in which he set it out in full and the contradictions apparent in the record when the appellant was giving evidence make the reasons for his decision self apparent the complainant s evidence was given logically she did not contradict herself the bruise on her mouth was consistent with both her evidence and the appellant s however the appellant had given two different explanations for it there is evidence that the complainant was distressed immediately after the incident and there is evidence of recent complaint which is consistent with her account of the incident it is therefore unsurprising that the court preferred her evidence in relation to the medical report i note that although the prosecution tried to tender it from the bar table the defence objected and asked for the doctor to be called the court agreed and thereafter although the doctor did not give evidence the court placed no weight at all on the medical report nor did counsel seek to call the doctor for the defence the last ground of appeal is that this was not a case of attempted rape but one of indecent assault even on the evidence of the complainant although this ground was not specifically raised in the letter of appeal i am considering it because the appellant is not represented by counsel further this ground raises important issues of law which warrant determination section 380 of the penal code provides as follows when a person intending to commit an offence begins to put his intention into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment and manifests his intention by some overt act but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence it is immaterial except so far as regards punishment whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention it is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to the offender it is impossible in fact to commit the offence the elements of the offence of attempted rape are first that the accused intended to have carnal knowledge without consent and second that he did some overt act to put his intention into execution often the intent to rape is implied from the nature of the overt act a touching of the breasts may only constitute an indecent assault an attempt to take off underclothes together with a touching of the breasts may constitute a sufficient overt act a great deal depends on the circumstances of each case the overt acts in this case were the holding of the complainant s hand the pulling of the complainant towards the porch the holding of the complainant against the wall the pulling up of her skirt the touching of her private parts the pushing of the complainant to the floor and the appellant s act of bending down and unbuttoning of his trousers together with these acts he told her to keep her mouth shut and to come here and to shut her mouth or he would punch her he only desisted when she threatened to tell the father of her daughter a fellow police officer all that was left for the appellant to do was to attempt a penetration his aggressive conduct makes it clear that he was doing what he was doing despite her lack of consent to that conduct in hari chand v state crim app 03 of 2005lab i found that where the appellant pushed the victim onto a bed lifted up her dress pulled down his own trousers and put his hand over her mouth when she struggled accompanied by a request for sexual intercourse there was sufficient evidence to prove both the overt acts and the intention to rape it is essentially a question of fact whether the offender s acts are sufficiently overt or proximate r v patnaik 2000 3 archbold news 2 on the basis of the complainant s evidence there was ample proof of an intention to rape and of overt acts which manifested that intention it is irrelevant that he desisted of his own motion he had already committed the overt acts with the necessary mens rea the offence was complete this was not a case of indecent assault the learned magistrate s judgment makes it apparent that he considered the necessary elements of the offence of attempted rape and correctly directed himself on those elements the appeal against convictions is dismissed the appellant did not pursue his appeal against sentence however the 2 year term of imprisonment is within the tariff for attempted rape and is not manifestly excessive in joji aunima v state cr app 33 2000 i identified the tariff for attempted rape as being 12 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment sentences at the upper end of the tariff should be imposed where gratuitous violence is inflicted where a weapon is used where there is a gross breach of trust or where there is a large age gap between complainant and offender in hari chand v state supra i upheld a 3 year term for the attempted rape of his daughter in law by the offender there was no gratuitous violence but there was a gross breach of trust in this case the 2 year term imposed is at the lower end of the tariff although the appellant was of previous good character the offence involved a gross breach of trust he was a police officer in uniform he was also well known to the victim i do not take into account the punch he delivered because he was charged separately for it on count 2 the sentence was

a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors the final term should fall within the tariff if the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range as for the starting point the uk sentencing guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non domestic context therefore the starting point

80351,sentence 1 sant kumar you freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty to act with intent to cause grievous harm after the charge was reduced from attempted murder and to escaping from lawful custody i convict you of both charges 2 the facts are that you were in a de facto relationship with the victim on DATE the victim left your home in lautoka and returned to her mothers home in bulileka labasa after an argument the following day you followed her to labasa with the intention to persuade her to return home with you on the morning of DATE you had an argument with the victim when she refused to return with you to lautoka you grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed the victim once just below her left shoulder she screamed you ran away 3 the victim was taken to the hospital by her family she sustained a wound on her left shoulder the wound was 1 5 cm in length and less than 2 cm in depth the wound was not life threatening but the victim was kept under observation in the hospital for five days 4 on DATE you attempted to commit a suicide by hanging yourself at a schoolbus shelter you were rescued by some members of the public who alerted the police afterwards the police transported you to the hospital you sustained abrasions and swells around your neck after medical examination you were kept in the hospital under police guard 5 on DATE you sneaked out of the hospital without the police guards knowledge you were apprehended on the same day at bulileka and returned to the hospital you remained in the hospital until DATE when the police took you for questioning in your interview you admitted stabbing the victim 6 on DATE you were charged with stabbing the victim with a knife you made a statement to the police that you felt sorry for the victim after stabbing her you thought she would die and that is why you tried to commit a suicide 7 you are 42 years old and married with children you are a bus driver by profession and you are the sole breadwinner for your family your three children are attending school 8 the victims mother gave evidence of the financial assistance you gave to her family before the stabbing incident in mitigation your counsel informs the court that the victim visited you several times while you were in custody on remand you say that the victim has forgiven you however there is no confirmation of this from the victim 9 a more compelling mitigating factor in your favour is that you are a first time offender in the last 42 years you have lived a blameless life 10 the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is punishable by life imprisonment the maximum penalty for escaping from lawful custody is two years imprisonment both offences arise from the same facts and therefore deserving concurrent sentences 11 your counsel has referred to numerous cases to persuade the court to impose a suspended sentence i bear in mind that sentences are imposed based on the facts of each case 12 the most helpful guideline case for the offence of intent to cause grievous harm is the decision of shameem j in state v mokubula 2003 fjhc 164 in that case shameem j held that the tariff for act with intent to cause grievous harm is between 6 months to 5 years imprisonment and that in case of an attack by a weapon the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years depending on the nature of the weapon 13 by assaulting your de facto partner you clearly breached her trust the fact that the stabbing arose from a domestic dispute aggravates the offence your subsequent attempt to commit a suicide demonstrates to me that you have fatal obsession towards the victim 14 the mitigating factors are your guilty pleas confession to the police remorse previous good character and family circumstances 15 for the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm i pick 2 years imprisonment as my starting point i increase the sentence to 3 years to reflect the aggravating factors i reduce the sentence to 12 months to reflect the mitigating factors and the remand period of 37 days 16 i sentence you to 12 months imprisonment for act with intent to cause grievous harm and to 1 month imprisonment for escaping from lawful custody to be served concurrently 17 i now consider whether to suspend your sentence suspension of sentence is generally reserved for a first time and a young offender although you are a first time offender you are not a young offender 18 the offences arose from a domestic relationship where the vulnerable partner was stabbed with a knife the court has a duty to denounce your conduct and to deter you and others from committing this kind of offences domestic arguments are inevitable in relationships men must restrain themselves from using violence on their partners during domestic arguments despite your previous good character and other compelling mitigating factors i give priority to the principle of deterrence and have decided not to suspend your terms of imprisonment 19 since you are now convicted of a domestic violence offence i am bound by the domestic violence decree to issue a restraining order against you to protect the victim from any form of violence in future by you i order you to stay away from the victim in future and you must not commit any form of assault or threat on her in future the victim may apply to the high court to have this

of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 i am satisfied with your plea is unequivocal and that you understand the repercussion of your plea 2 according to the facts which you have admitted on DATE victim pw 1 is your wife was at home after work at about 1830 hrs you were drinking at home at that time you asked your wife to drink but she refused to join she had a bath and she went to bed then at about

this matter was reported to the police and victim was hospitalised for treatments 3 maximum penalty could be imposed for this offence is five years imprisonment 4 it was held in state v tugalala 2008 fjhc 78 hac025s 2008s DATE the tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment as cited in earlier case in elizabeth joseph v the state 2004 haa 030 04s and state v tevita alafi 2004 haa073 04s that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence the use of a pen knife for instance justifies a higher starting point where there has been a deliberate assault causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation a discharge is not appropriate in domestic violence cases sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld in amasai korovata v the state 2006 haa 115 06s aggravating factors of the offence 5 following facts were revealed by the summary of facts placed before the court and will be considered as aggravating factors deliberate assault cause injuries to the victim domestic violence 6 medical examination form reveals that the complainant of this case has sustained three injuries 7 in my view you have committed this crime with anger and under the influence of liquor anger does not produce anything apart from the violence and peril of your life and others lives in general it may cause your and other peoples life miserable but fortunately this case has not led up to that much 8 you pleaded guilty for the charge at the first instance therefore you are entitled for reduction of your sentence you have reconciled with your wife that is the complainant of this case and she confirmed before this court but with conditions domestic violence is a serious offence and pervades all over the world thousands of innocent victims have been battered daily and lamentably most of incidences are not reported to legal authorities offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a reconcilable offence but this court notes the offence that you have committed comes within the purview of section 3 1 and 2 of domestic violence decree 33 of 2009 in that event it cannot be reconciled under section 154 6 of criminal procedure decree no 43 of 2009 hence your reconciliation of the victim with your wife has no legal effect and it should be turned down mitigating factors 9 in mitigation you said that you are 50 years old married with 4 children you are self employed you earn 100 per week you reconciled with the complainant you are asking forgiveness and leniency of this court you are a first offender 10 victim is your wife and you treated her in bad manner though she is your wife you have no legal right to beat her the innocent wife came before court and consented to reconciliation subject to condition namely you should be in sober every day your drunkenness has caused their life in misery did you get any sort of relief from drinking alcohols i do not think you are addicted to alcohols and it deteriorated your health conditions and others safety of their lives they do not have peace of mind because of your incorrigible habit as i mentioned in paragraph 3 you could have sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and that is the intention of parliament to punish this kind of offenders if i sentence you will lose family atmosphere since you have reconciled considering all factors i select to adopt an alternate sentence thus i think it is inappropriate to consider custodial sentence in this matter therefore i am not setting a starting point for this offence this court hopes this order enables you to contribute a peaceful homely atmosphere within your family life this is the final chance that you are given and you are severely warned not to re offend 11 therefore i proceed to adjourn the proceedings of this case for 03 years in accordance with the guidelines set out in sec 44 2 and 3 of the sentencing and penalty decree 2009 you are bound over for sum of 2000

consequent to the plea of not guilty entered by the appellant the matter proceeded to hearing the prosecution proposed to adduce the record of the caution interview in evidence for which the appellant objected hence the voir dire hearing was conducted on the DATE the learned trial judge on the same day ruled that the caution interview of the appellant is admissible in evidence the hearing of the substantive charge also commenced on the same day of DATE and concluded on the DATE the prosecution adduced the evidence of five witnesses including the complainant subsequently the appellant and one witness gave evidence for the defence the learned counsel for the prosecution and the defence then made their respective closing addresses on the DATE the learned trial judge delivered his summing up on the DATE the three assessors returned with mixed opinions where two of them found in their respective opinions that the appellant was not guilty for this offence and one assessor found him guilty the learned trial judge in his judgment dated DATE dissenting with the majority opinion of the assessors found the appellant guilty for the offence as charged and convicted him accordingly the appellant was then sentenced to seven 7 years imprisonment with a non parole period of five 5 years on the DATE 4 aggrieved with the said conviction the appellant has filed a timely leave to appeal application to the fiji court of appeal on the following grounds which i reproduce verbatim as follows the learned judge erred in law when he shifts the burden of proof to the appellant by requiring the appellant to prove his innocent in the judgment through his credibility and forthrightness in responding to questions in cross examination the learned judge erred in law when he failed to include in his summing up and also properly consider the evidence under cross examination of pw2 namely mereani who was the aunty of the complainant and are as follows she agreed that the complainant was shocked to see her she agreed that when the complainant came down to the foot of the hill near the cave to where she stood the complainant had a guilty look she agreed that she only beat the complainant after she was asking the complainant and the complainant was not saying anything the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact when he did not direct the assessors on the complainant s evidence which was given on oath where she agreed that only after she was sacked by the aunty she then begun to talk a bit 5 the respondent also filed notice of appeal and advanced the following grounds against the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge that the sentence is manifestly lenient having regards to the sentencing guidelines and applicable tariff for the rape of a child the period spent in remand is not a mitigating factor 6 the single judge of the court of appeal in his ruling dated DATE refused to grant leave to the appeal against the conviction as sought by the appellant and also refused to grant leave to the appeal against sentence as advanced by the respondent 7 the appellant then renewed his appeal against the conviction on the same grounds pursuant to section 35 3 of the court of appeal act accordingly this court heard the respective oral submissions on the DATE and considered the written submissions of the appellant and the respondent the learned counsel for the respondent informed the court on the date of the hearing that the respondent also renews his appeal against the sentence factual background 8 the respondent alleged that the appellant on the DATE met the complainant at the bilo gun site as she came to return the keys of his house he then offered to take her on a site seeing visit around the gun site the appellant then pulled her into a cave and forcefully removed her clothes subsequently he undressed himself and forcefully had sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent 9 the appellant denied this allegation though he admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant on the DATE at the gun site he claimed that it was a consensual sexual intercourse ground one 10 having briefly discussed the factual and procedural background of this appeal i now turn to the first ground of appeal that is founded on the contention that the learned judge has shifted the burden of proof to the appellant in his judgment 11 the submissions of the appellant pertaining to this ground of appeal is mainly focused on the paragraph twelve of the judgment where his lordship has stated that coupled with the above the way the accused re acted to being cross examined by the prosecutor after giving sworn evidence did not put him in a good light i observed him to be a very evasive witness he evaded most of the questions thrown by the prosecution he was not forthright leading me to the conclusion that he was not a credible witness had he been forthright with his answers i would possibly have reached a different conclusion 12 according to section 237 5 of the criminal procedure act the judgment of the court encompasses the summing up the decision of the court together with the reasons for differing with the majority opinion of the assessor 13 the supreme court of fiji in ram v state 2012 fjsc 12 cav0001 20 DATE has expounded the scope of section 237 of the criminal procedure act emphasizing the duty of the judge to provide reasons if he disagrees with the majority opinion of the assessors in an inclusive manner justice marsoof held at para 79 that after the criminal procedure ordinance no 23 of 1875 introduced a system of a trail by a judge sitting with assessors as an alternative to trial by jury with respect to certain selected categories of cases involving the native population trial by jury was abolished altogether by the criminal procedure code amendment ordinance no 35 of 1961 the system of trial by a judge and assessors differs in one important aspect from trial by jury as unlike under the jury system even the unanimous opinion of the assessors does not bind the trial judge who is free in appropriate cases to differ and pronounce his own verdict section 84 of the ordinance of 1875 simply provided that the opinion of each assessor shall be given orally but the decision shall be vested exclusively in the judge but section 299 2 of the criminal procedure code chapter 21 which was in force at the time of the high court trial in 2008 expressly provided that the trial judge shall not be bound to conform to the opinions of the assessors according to the proviso to the said sub section when the trial judge disagrees with the majority opinion of the assessors he shall give his reasons which shall be written down and be pronounced in open court for differing with such majority opinion and in every such case the judges summing up and the decision of the court together with where appropriate the judges reasons for differing with the majority opinion of the assessors shall collectively be deemed to be the judgment of the court although the criminal procedure code has since been repealed section 237 of the criminal procedure decree of 2009 which replaced the above quoted provision of the code follows the same principle and provides that the trial judge shall not be bound to conform to the opinions of the assessors and goes on to re enact that the trial judge shall give his reasons for differing from the opinion of the assessors 14 in view of the above observation this court needs to examine the summing up and the judgment as a whole in order to determine whether the learned judge has misdirected the assessors and himself by shifting the burden of proof on the appellant 15 in paragraph two of the summing up the learned judge has directed the assessors that they have to decide what happened in this case and which version of the evidence is reliable 16 the learned judge in paragraphs four and thirty of the summing up has specifically explained that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution and it never shifts to the accused as he is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty 17 in spite of his direction given in paragraphs four and thirty the learned judge has directed the assessors in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six of the summing up that the decision of accepting which of the conflicting version of events given by the prosecution and the defence mainly depends on their assessment of credibility between the appellant and the complainant who is more credible between the appellant and the complainant the learned judge in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six has stated that 22 the state s case against the accused stands or falls on whether or not you accept the complainant or the accused s version of events on the second and third element of rape as discussed in paragraphs 9 i and 9 ii hereof if you accept the complainant s version of events then you must find the accused is guilty as charged if you accept the accused s version of events then you must find him not guilty as charged i will not bore you with the details but i will summaries to you the parties competing versions of events 26 so you will see that the complainant s and accused s version of events on the alleged rape incident are completely at odds with each other your decision on which version of events to accept and or reject will depend largely on your assessment on which of the two witnesses is the credible one in other words the state s case against the accused stands or falls on whether or not you find the complainant or the accused to be a credible witness you have watched them give evidence in the court room who was the more credible of the two who was the more forthright of the two who was the evasive witness of the two who was hiding something from you who from your point of view was telling the truth your answers to the above questions will determine your answers to whether or not the accused is guilty as charged if you find the complainant to be a credible witness then you will find the accused guilty as charged if you find the accused a credible witness then you will find him not guilty as charged it is entirely a matter for you 18 in view of the above two paragraphs the learned judge has given the direction to the assessors to evaluate the evidence given by the appellant and the complainant in order to determine who is more credible and telling the truth if they found that the evidence given by the complainant is credible and truthful they can find the appellant is guilty likewise if they found the evidence given by the appellant is credible and truthful the assessors can determine the appellant is not guilty 19 in paragraph thirteen of the judgment the learned judge has found the complainant as a more credible witness than the appellant accordingly the learned judge has accepted the evidence given by the complainant in paragraph thirteen the learned judge states that as a result of the above i found the complainant a more credible witness than the accused leading me to accept her as a credible witness i accept her evidence that she did not consent to sex with the accused at the material time and that the accused knew she was not consenting to sex at the material time if the complainant consented to sex at the material time why the need to throw her on the floor resulting in abrasions to the back of her left shoulder 20 accordingly the learned judge has accepted the evidence given by the complainant on the ground that she is a more credible witness than the appellant by doing that the learned judge has placed a burden on the appellant to satisfy the court that the evidence given by him in the hearing is more credible than of the complainant s in order to defeat the case of the prosecution which he failed to satisfy 21 in the minority decision of brennan j in liberato and others v the queen 1985 1985 hca 66 159 clr 507 at 515 has succinctly discussed the appropriate approach for directing the jury in a case where there is conflicting versions of evidence given by the prosecution witnesses and the evidence given by the defence witnesses brennan j held that when a case turns on a conflict between the evidence of a prosecution witness and the evidence of a defence witness it is commonplace for a judge to invite a jury to consider the question who is to be believed but it is essential to ensure by suitable direction that the answer to that question which the jury would doubtless ask themselves in any event if adverse to the defence is not taken as concluding the issue whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issue which it bears the onus of proving the jury must be told that even if they prefer the evidence for the prosecution they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence the jury must be told that even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue his honour did not make clear to the jury and the omission was hardly remedied by acknowledging that the question whom to believe is a gross simplification 22 dunford j in r v li 2003 140 a crim r 288 at 301 adopting the principle enunciated by brennan j in the minority decision in liberato supra held that not only was it there in his last passage a reference to a doubt based on reason but in two instances the judge has proposed to the jury the question which of the two cases is correct what the complainant says or what the appellant says this was also a material misdirection the issue can never be which of the cases is correct or who of the complainant and the accused is telling the truth liberato v the queen 1985 hca 66 1985 159 clr 507 at 515 they should have been directed the test was whether taking into account the whole of the evidence including what had been said by the appellant in his recorded interview and the witnesses called in his case they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant s evidence 23 basnayake ja in goundar v state 2015 fjca 1 aau0077 20 DATE while accepting the principle as expounded in liberato supra and r v li supra held that the learned judge directed the assessors to find the appellant guilty or not guilty by considering whose evidence they believe by so doing the assessors have been misdirected with regard to the burden of proof and thereby caused a miscarriage of justice the assessors may believe the evidence of emma and disbelieve the evidence of the appellant it does not mean that the case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt if after considering the evidence of the whole case a reasonable doubt is created in the minds of the assessors with regard to the guilt of the appellant the appellant is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and entitled to an acquittal the courts have held in a series of cases that it is not correct to find the guilt of the accused by allowing the assessors to believe either party empasis added 24 the appellant is not obliged to give evidence he does not have to prove his innocence as his innocence is presumed by law however in this case the appellant has decided to give evidence therefore such evidence given by the appellant has to be taken into consideration when determining the issues of facts of this case 25 lord reading cj in abramovitch 1914 84 l j k b 397 held that if an explanation has been given by the accused then it is for the jury to say whether on the whole of the evidence they are satisfied that the accused is guilty if the jury think that the explanation given may reasonably be true although they are not convinced that it is true the prisoner is entitle to be acquitted inasmuch as the crown would then have failed to discharge the burden impose upon it by our law of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused the onus of proof is never shifted in these cases it always remains on the prosecution 26 accordingly the learned judge is required to direct the assessors that if they believe the evidence given by the appellant is true then the appellant must be acquitted if the assessors neither believe nor disbelieve the version of the appellant yet it creates a reasonable doubt in their mind about the prosecution s case they must find the appellant is not guilty 27 even if the assessors and or the judge reject the version of the appellant that does not mean that the prosecution has established that the appellant is guilty for the offence still they have to satisfy that the prosecution has established on its own evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has committed this offence as charged in the information 28 according to the above discussed reasons it is clear that the directions given by the learned judge in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six of the summing up are actually founded on misguided principles on the burden of proof in a criminal proceedings however i am mindful about the directions given by the learned judge in paragraphs four and thirty of the summing up where his lordship has specifically stated that the burden of proof that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution and it will never shift to the accused at any stage of the trial irrespective of the above directions given in paragraphs four and thirty the directions given in paragraphs twenty two and twenty six in order to evaluate the evidence given by the complainant against the evidence of the appellant has created a confusion thus making a material misdirection on the burden of proof 29 in spite of the above misdirection on the burden of prove the assessors in their majority opinion found the appellant is not guilty for the offence as charged the learned judge in his judgment dissenting with the majority opinions of the assessors found the appellant guilty for the offence and convicted him accordingly the learned judge is the final adjudicator of facts and law of the matter the assessors only provide him their opinion which he could take into consideration in his judgment vide noa maya v state 2015 fjsc 30 cav009 2015 DATE hence i now proceed to determine whether the learned judge in his judgment has misdirected himself on the issue of burden of prove 30 in paragraph twelve of his judgment the learned judge has found the appellant is not a credible witness on the grounds of his evasiveness and the demeanour in giving evidence during the cross examination by the learned counsel for the prosecution the learned judge then in paragraph thirteen found the complainant as a more credible witness than the appellant and accepted the evidence given by the complainant 31 it is clear that the learned judge has found the appellant guilty by considering whose evidence is more credible by doing that the learned judge has misdirected himself with regard to the burden of proof causing a miscarriage of justice grounds two and three 32 the second and third grounds of appeal are founded on the contention that the learned judge has not properly directed the assessors in the summing up about the evidence given by the second witness for the prosecution specially regarding the events that have taken place after she met and encountered the complainant and the appellant near the gun site moreover the appellant contends that the learned judge has failed to properly direct the assessors in the summing up about the evidence given by the complainant during the cross examination where she has stated that she told her aunty about this incident after she was beaten up by the aunty with a stick therefore for the convenience i proceed to deal with the second and third grounds of appeal together 33 the prosecution presented the evidence of five witnesses they are the complainant the aunty of the complainant father of the complainant the doctor who conducted the medical examination of the complainant and the police officer who conducted the caution interview of the appellant the medical report of the complainant and the caution interview of the appellant were tendered as the exhibits of the prosecution the defence presented the evidence of the appellant and one rusiate who is the son of the second witness of the prosecution and cousin of the complainant 34 the complainant in her evidence explained about this incident she has gone to the gun site to return the key to the appellant he was in the bure he has offered to take her around the gun site the appellant has then pulled her inside a cave he has then pushed her down injuring her left shoulder the appellant has not said anything she was scared and ashamed he has pulled her wrap around sulu the appellant then undressed himself and put his penis into her vagina the appellant has had sexual intercourse with her for about five minutes when he finished she has heard that her aunty was calling her from outside of the cave she came out from the cave her aunty was angry and hit her asking what happened she cried and only after she was hit by her aunt with a stick she told her aunty about this incident 35 the aunty of the complainant in her evidence stated that the complainant looked shocked and guilty when she came out of the tunnel she was crying and had scratches on her shoulder when she asked what happened the complainant did not answer initially hence she had to beat the victim with a stick then she told her about this incident 36 the doctor in his evidence specifically stated that according to his opinion a penetration had most likely occurred but not beyond reasonable doubt moreover the doctor has stated in his evidence that he cannot be certain of what happened if the examination was done a day after the incident he would be certain of his medical conclusion 37 detective sergeant mikaele koro who is the interviewing officer of the caution interview of the appellant explained in his evidence the manner and the way he recorded the interview of the appellant 38 the main contention of the appellant is that the learned judge has not directed the assessors the following evidence that were given by the first and second witnesses for the prosecution inter alia the complainant was shocked and looked guilty when she came out of the tunnel when the aunty asked her what happened she did not answer initially the complainant told her aunty about this incident only after she was beaten up by the aunty with a stick 39 archibold 2017 paragraph 4 438 pg 555 states that brevity in summing up is a virtue not a vice there is no obligation to rehearse all the evidence or all the arguments generally speaking however the longer a trial has lasted the greater will be the jurys need for assistance in relation to the evidence in a trial lasting several days or more it will generally be of assistance if the judge summarizes those factual matters that are not in dispute and where there is a significant dispute as to material facts identifies succinctly those pieces of evidence that are in conflict but the summing up should never be a mere rehearsal of the evidence and appeals based merely on the failure of the judge to refer to a particular piece of evidence or a particular argument will find little favor in the court of appeal r v farr 163 j p 193 ca nevertheless a judge cannot abandon his responsibility to marshal and arrange the facts issues by issue to counsel and their speeches or to the jury and their notes r v amado taylor 2000 2 cr app r 189 ca 40 according to page ninety eight of the record of the proceedings in the high court it appears that the learned counsel for the appellant has raised these issues before the learned judge as re directions the record of the proceedings in the high court states that the learned judge has accordingly re directed the assessors therefore it is clear that the learned judge has re directed the assessors regarding the above discussed evidence determination of appeals by the court of appeal pursuant to section 23 1 of the court of appeal act 41 section 23 1 a of the court of appeal act stipulates that on any such appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal 42 the proviso of section 23 1 of the court of appeal act states that provided that the court may notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal against conviction or against acquittal might be decided in favour of the appellant dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred 43 according to section 23 1 a it is clear that the court of appeal shall allow the appeal if the court thinks that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that there had been a wrong decision of any question of law or on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice it is clear from the proviso to section 23 1 the duty of the court of appeal is to satisfy itself that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice at the trial 44 having considered section 23 1 of the court of appeal act i now proceed to evaluate the evidence adduced in the hearing in order to determine whether the conviction entered by the learned judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the totality of the evidence adduced in the hearing or there has been a miscarriage of justice 45 in this case the main disputed issue is whether the complainant gave her consent to the appellant to have sexual intercourse which took place in private inside the gun site cave on this issue the consent depends on the evidence given by the complainant against the evidence given by the appellant under such circumstances it is necessary for the assessors and the trial judge to scrutinize the evidence given by the complainant with great care vide r v li supra goundar v state supra 46 while dissenting with the majority opinion of the assessors the learned judge in paragraph eleven of his judgment has found that the healed abrasions that were found on the left shoulder of the complainant support the claim of the complainant that she did not consent to the appellant to have sexual intercourse with her 47 the complainant in her evidence said that her left shoulder got injured when the appellant pushed her down inside the cave the appellant and the complainant had no disagreement regarding the position that they had this sexual intercourse the appellant came on top of her while she was lying on the ground of the cave there is no evidence adduced by the prosecution that the complainant was lying on a cloth or any other material accordingly it is clear that the complainant had this alleged sexual intercourse with the appellant while she was lying on the open ground inside the cave according to the evidence given by the complainant the appellant had this sexual intercourse with her for about five minutes 48 the learned judge neither in the summing up directed the assessors nor in the judgment has directed himself about this evidence regarding the circumstances in which this alleged sexual intercourse took place under such circumstances it is difficult to deny the possibility that such abrasions could have been sustained on the shoulder of the complainant if she engaged in a consensual sexual intercourse with the appellant in the same position on the ground of the tunnel hence i find that the healed abrasions found on the left shoulder of the victim could neither support the version of the prosecution nor of the defence 49 during the evidence in chief the complainant had said that the appellant pulled her inside the cave however during the cross examination she had stated that the appellant did not ask her to follow him he went into the cave and she followed him this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant could undoubtedly create a reasonable doubt whether the appellant pulled her inside the cave or she just followed him into the cave on her own volition unless the complainant provides an explanation for this contradiction in her own evidence the learned judge has neither directed the assessor in the summing up nor himself in the judgment regarding this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant 50 the complainant in her evidence has stated that she did not like what happened to her according to her evidence the appellant had not said anything to her nor she has said anything to the appellant during this alleged incident however changing her earlier position the complainant has then said that she told the appellant that she did not want the appellant to do what he was going to do again she has said that neither she nor the appellant said anything consequent to this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant there is a reasonable doubt whether she told the appellant that she did not like what he was doing or not the learned judge has neither directed the assessor in the summing up nor himself in the judgment regarding this inconsistent nature of the evidence given by the complainant 51 moreover during the cross examination the complainant has stated that she did not know that rusiate was following her from behind when she was going to the gun site she has then said that she did not try to run and escape from the cave as rusiate was at the door she has not sought assistance from him as she suspected that he also wanted to have sex with her according to the evidence given by the second witness for the prosecution she had asked rusiate about the complainant when she was looking for the complainant around the area rusiate had then told her that the complainant is down there the second witness for the prosecution has not specifically stated about the place or the location where she met rusiate meanwhile rusiate who was called to give evidence for the defence has stated that he saw the complainant and the appellant walking into the cave the appellant was walking in front of the complainant and she was following him his version of events supports the evidence given by the complainant in cross examination where she has stated that she just followed the appellant into the cave furthermore rusiate in his evidence has stated that he stayed in the office which is about five metres away from the tunnel after the appellant and the complainant walked into the cave rusiate has then heard that the second witness for the prosecution was calling the complainant he has then run towards the tunnel would it create a reasonable doubt whether rusiate was standing at the door of the cave preventing the complainant from escaping and also waiting to have sex with her if all of this evidence was properly taken into consideration the learned judge has neither directed the assessors in the summing up nor himself in the judgment about this evidence 52 i now draw my attention to the admissions made by the appellant in his caution interview which had been tendered in evidence as an exhibit by the prosecution 53 the learned judge in paragraph twenty nine of the summing up has directed the assessors as follows if you accept that pw5 was a credible witness then you will accept that the accused gives his alleged confession voluntarily and use the same against him in other words by accepting the accused s alleged confession it will have the effect of strengthening the complainant s evidence and the complainant s credibility as a witness and thereby find the accused guilty as charged if you find the accused s explanation was credible then you will reject his alleged confession you will have to work on the other evidence to make a decision in this case it is a matter entirely for you 54 according to the above passage in the summing up i find that the learned judge has directed the assessors to consider only the voluntariness in making this alleged confession by the appellant the issue of the voluntariness in making the caution interview by the appellant is a matter relevant to the admissibility of the caution interview in evidence which is an issue for the learned judge to decide upon a voir dire inquiry the truthfulness and probative value of the contents of the caution interview is a matter for the assessors and the trial judge to decide in the substantive hearing 55 the learned judge in his judgment has not discussed about the truthfulness or the probative value of the contents of the caution interview made by the appellant furthermore his lordship has not stated in the judgment that the evidence adduced in the hearing led him to change his earlier position which he took in the voir dire ruling regarding the voluntariness in making the caution interview 56 hon chief justice gates in lulu v state 2017 fjsc 19 cav0035 2016 DATE found that the direction suggested by justice keith in maya v state 2015 fjsc 30 cav009 2015 DATE has no relevancy if the trial judge remains of the conclusion that he reached in voir dire that the confession was made voluntarily where his lordship chief justice held that in his judgment after receiving

caution interview the direction as suggested in noa maya supra keith j at para 23 following mushtaq 2005 ukhc 25 is therefore not so relevant 57 in this case the learned judge has not changed his mind regarding his earlier conclusion on the issue of voluntariness in making the caution interview hence the direction on voluntaries in the summing up has no relevance 58 prematilaka ja in volau v state

the defence is entitled to canvass again the question of voluntariness and to call evidence relating to that issue at the trial second bite at the cherry but such evidence goes to the weight and value that the jury would attach to the confession chan wei keung prasad and murray inter alia on the premise that there might be cases in which the jury would conclude that a statement is involuntary according to the rule relating to inducement but nonetheless it is manifestly true wendo iii once a confession is ruled as being voluntary by the trial judge whether the accused made it it is true and sufficient for the conviction i e the weight or probative value are matters that should be left to the assessors to decide as questions of fact at the trial in that assessment the jury should be directed to take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the making of the confession including allegations of force if those allegations were thought to be true to decide whether they should place any weight or value on it or what weight or value they would place on it it is the duty of the trial judge to make this plain to them 59 the learned judge in his summing up has not directed the assessors to decide following issues whether the appellant made this confession the truthfulness and what is the probative value of the contents of the confession 60 in order to determine the truthfulness and the probative value of the contents of the caution interview it is necessary to take into consideration all the evidence adduced in the hearing 61 according to the answers given by the appellant pertaining to questions fifteen and eighteen of the caution interview the appellant has called the complainant to come with him inside the gun tunnel site while they were inside the gun tunnel he has pulled the complainant in to one corner however the complainant in her evidence in chief has stated that she was pulled inside the cave by the appellant during the cross examination contradicting her earlier version given in evidence in chief the complainant has stated that the appellant went into the cave and she followed him thereafter the appellant pushed her down to the floor accordingly it is clear that there are inconsistencies between the evidence given by the complainant with the confession made by the appellant in the caution interview creating a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness of the contents of the confession 62 having considered the reasons discussed above it is my considered opinion that if all these issues discussed above pertaining to the evidence given by the complainant were taken into proper consideration together with all other evidence adduced during the course of the hearing the verdict would have been favorable to the appellant i accordingly find that the conviction entered against the appellant cannot be supported having regarded the totality of evidence adduced in the hearing hence i am satisfied that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred i accordingly set aside the conviction and the sentence entered against the appellant for the offence of rape 63 in view of the above conclusion i find no reason to proceed and determine the grounds of appeal advanced by the respondent against the sentence i accordingly dismiss the same alternative count of defilement of young person between 13 and 16 years of age 64 section 162 1 f and 2 of the criminal procedure act allows the court to convict an accused for a lessor or alternative offence where it states that where a person is charged with an offence but the court is satisfied that the evidence adduced in the trial supports a conviction only for a lesser or alternative offence the court may record a conviction made after due process for any sexual offence where the charge has been for rape the court may record convictions for certain offences in accordance with sub section 1 notwithstanding that no charge has been laid for the lesser or alternative offence in accordance with the provisions of this decree 65 according to the evidence adduced during this hearing the appellant and the complainant did not dispute about this alleged sexual intercourse the complainant was thirteen years old at the time this sexual encounter took place according to the evidence given by the appellant he knew the complainant as she is related to him

246502,judgment the appellant was convicted by the magistrate court upon pleading guilty to one count of assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 275 of the crimes decree 2009 now crimes act the learned magistrate sentenced the appellant for a term of 12 months imprisonment the appellant assails the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate on the following grounds of appeal the learned magistrates sentencing is harsh and excessive in the circumstances of the case and the petitioner was just a first offender and had a previous clean record in his whole life of 42 years and therefore a suspended sentence or a partially suspended sentence would have been appropriate in this circumstance the summary of facts filed before the learned magistrate reads as follows on friday 18 12 15 between 6pm to 6 30pm anaiasa naqialawa b 1 43 years painter at cool tech refrigeration samabula punched his wife namely seruwaia vuki a 1 32 years domestic duties of lomolomo vuda lautoka on

accused was charged for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 275 of crimes decree no 44 of 2009 accused was bailed to appear in court on 03 02 16 in the case of kim nam bae v the state aau0015 of 1998s DATE the court of appeal said thus it is well established law that before this court can disturb the sentence the appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion if the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some relevant consideration then the appellate court may impose a different sentence this error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 therefore in order for this court to interfere with the impugned sentence the appellant should satisfy that the learned magistrate acted upon a wrong principle allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him mistook the facts or did not take into account some relevant consideration ground one the learned magistrate has selected 12 months as the starting point of the sentence added 12 months in view of the aggravating factors that were identified and deducted 6 months in view of the mitigating factors further 6 months was deducted as the discount for the early guilty plea to arrive at the final sentence of 12 months imprisonment on the first ground of appeal the appellant argues that the learned magistrate erred by selecting a high starting point and that led to a harsh and excessive sentence being imposed on the appellant given the circumstances of the case in fact the appellant submits that the starting point selected by the learned magistrate is outside the higher end of the established tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm relying on the case of jonetani sereka v state 2008 fjhc 88 haa027 2008 DATE in sereka supra referring to the case state v anjula devi criminal case no 04 of 1998 lab the court noted that the tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm is a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault the learned magistrate has identified an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment as the applicable tariff in this case relying on the judgment in state v tugalala 2008 fjhc 78 the court held in tugalala supra as follows the tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment the high court said in elizabeth joseph v the state 2004 haa 030 04s and state v tevitaalafi 2004 haa073 04s that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence the starting point of 12 months selected by the learned magistrate is in fact the higher end of the tariff the learned magistrate decided to apply according to paragraph 9 of the impugned decision i note that the learned magistrate had considered the gravity of the offending and the appellant s culpability when the starting point was selected therefore it is clear that in selecting this starting point of 12 months imprisonment the learned magistrate had overlooked the following principles discussed in the case of koroivuki v state aau 0018 of 2010 which the learned magistrate had in fact alluded to in the impugned decision in selecting a starting point the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence no reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff in order to arrive at a just and a proportionate sentence using the two tier method of sentencing the sentencer should not consider the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case at hand in selecting the starting point but consider the question what should be the minimum sentence the offence committed by the accused would attract as i have discussed in the case of gaunavinaka v state 2017 fjhc 425 haa 07 of 2017 DATE a sentencer who considers the gravity of the actual offending and or the culpability of the accused to select the starting point will in all probability arrive at an excessive final sentence for the reason that the same aggravating factors are taken into account twice in the sentencing process unless the sentencer is extremely careful in the event a sentencer opts to determine the starting point considering certain circumstances of the actual offending those circumstances that were considered to select the starting point should be clearly indicated in the ruling this will prevent appeal grounds being raised on the sentence being harsh and excessive due to double counting but more importantly such practice would also assist the sentencer to arrive at a just and an appropriate sentence using the two tier approach of sentencing by reducing the chances of taking into account the same factors to select a high starting point and then again to further increase the sentence in the case at hand the language used in the impugned decision suggests that the same aggravating factors that were taken into account to enhance the sentence by 12 months have been considered by the learned magistrate to select the higher end of the tariff as the starting point of the sentence i am inclined to agree with the appellant that this decision to select a manifestly high starting point had resulted in arriving at a sentence that is harsh and excessive given the circumstances of the case however i am unable to agree with the appellant s submission that the starting point selected by the learned magistrate is outside the established tariff this court in several previous decisions including kumar v state 2014 fjhc 592 haa18 2014 DATE state v naicker 2015 fjhc 537 hac279 2013 DATE state v jone 2016 fjhc 517 hac159 20 DATE and state v salayavi 2017 fjhc 198 hac203 2016 DATE has recognised an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment as the tariff for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm it is pertinent to note that 12 months is only a one fifth of a 5 year imprisonment which is the maximum sentence for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the crimes act all in all i am of the view that it is appropriate to have 12 months imprisonment as the higher end of the tariff for the said offence needless to say the selecting of a starting point is not that difficult where the relevant sentencing tariff indicates the lower end of the imprisonment term applicable to a particular offence as opposed to other sentencing options that may be considered if the sentencer decides that an imprisonment term is the appropriate punishment for an offender who is convicted of the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the crimes act and not to opt for an absolute or conditional discharge it is important for the sentencer to have a clear opinion on the minimum imprisonment term the offence should attract considering its objective seriousness in my view an imprisonment term of 3 months would appropriately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm under section 275 of the crimes act though the appellant has not raised any issue concerning the aggravating factors considered by the learned magistrate i wish to make the following observations regarding same the aggravating factors mentioned in the impugned decision are as follows abuse of trust and power the victim did not provoke you at all this is a domestic violence offence the first factor above is indeed an aggravating factor with regard to the second factor firstly i am not satisfied that the relevant summary of facts leads to the conclusion that there was no provocation in this case secondly and more importantly in my view though the fact that there was provocation may be considered as a mitigating factor the fact that there was no provocation cannot be considered as an aggravating factor to enhance the sentence in a case of assault on the face of it the third aggravating factor alluded to above that is the fact that the offence was a domestic violence offence seems to overlap with the first in my view the domestic relationship between the accused and the victim was the reason to conclude that there was an abuse of trust and power moreover it is pertinent to note that section 4 3 of the sentencing and penalties act provides certain factors a sentencer must have regard to when sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence therefore i am of the view that a sentence cannot be enhanced for the simple reason that the relevant offence falls under the category of domestic violence offences however certain factors listed under section 4 3 of the sentencing and penalties act among others may be considered as aggravating factors when it comes to a domestic violence offence as highlighted in the case of tugalala supra when it comes to the offence of assault casing actual bodily harm it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence if the injuries caused to the victim are serious that is undoubtedly one of the main aggravating factors the summary of facts filed in this case indicates that the victim was first assaulted with a stick then with an electricity wire and thereafter she was punched on the left ear and the head i note that the learned magistrate had taken this factor into account only when the issue of suspending the sentence was considered the manner in which the victim was attacked in this case as revealed in the summary of facts was a factor the learned magistrate should have considered as an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence i had the opportunity to peruse four judgments of this court where the offence involved assaulting the spouse in all four cases the offenders had pleaded guilty to the charge in raisoqoni v state 2011 fjhc 32 haa 004 2 DATE this court held that a sentence of 6 months was appropriate where the injuries sustained by the victim included lumps bruises laceration and swellings over her head and face in state v kumar 2011 fjhc 341 haa 020 20 DATE a suspended sentence of 6 months imprisonment was considered as the appropriate sentence where the victim had sustained injuries that included a swollen face bruises around both eyes swollen lips superficial cuts on the head and a broken tooth in chand v state 2011 fjhc 593 haa 024 2011 DATE a sentence of 4 months was held appropriate where the appellant had pushed and punched his wife causing her to fall and hit her head on the stud of the house in kumar v state 2014 fjhc 592 haa18 2014 DATE this court concluded that an imprisonment term of 7 months is the appropriate sentence where the appellant had slapped his wife and cut her on the left arm with a cane knife this offence had been committed while another case was pending against the appellant for assaulting his wife all in all i find merit in the first ground of appeal the error made by the learned magistrate as pointed out on behalf of the appellant on ground one justifies this court s intervention to disturb the sentence imposed on the appellant having considered the relevant aggravating factors and the mitigating factors including the fact that the appellant was a first offender and the early guilty plea i hold that a sentence of 6 months imprisonment is appropriate in this case ground two on the second ground of appeal the appellant submits that a suspended sentence or a partially suspended sentence would have been appropriate in the circumstances of the case since i have decided to substitute the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate with an imprisonment term of 6 months based on the findings on the first ground of appeal the determination of the above issue raised on the second ground of appeal would now become an academic exercise the appellant had served almost 5 months in prison as of today which is more than two third of a term of 6 months imprisonment conclusion in the result i would substitute the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate in mc suva crim case no 104 of 2016 with an imprisonment term of 6 months the order made by the learned magistrate granting a permanent domestic violence restraining order shall remain any application for variation suspension or discharge of this restraining order is to be filed and heard in the magistrate court at suva orders of this

81790,sentence prakash j the accused prabha wati has been found guilty of the offence of manslaughter she went on trial for the offence of murder the 3 assessors unanimous opinion was that she was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter the court has concurred with their opinion whatever analysis one undertakes of the assessors opinion whether not guilty to murder due to lack of malice aforethought or guilty of manslaughter due to provocation it is clear that the issue of domestic violence was central to the verdict in this case this is apparently the first case in fiji in which the phenomenon of battered womans syndrome was raised as the central plank of the defense case in mitigation learned defense counsel urged the court to give a chance to the accused to have some life for the rest of her days as he stated she did not have much of a life during her marriage due to the history of domestic violence it is evident that the accused began living with her deceased husband when she was about 16 years old her parents subsequently married her to him when she came of age according to the evidence her problems began when her first child was born her husband was apparently unhappy that she had given birth to a girl the situation compounded when she gave birth to 3 other daughters her husbands heavy drinking and womanising did not help matters she was subjected to sexual mental and physical abuse for much of her 35 or so years of marriage it is clear from the evidence that she suffered from battered womans syndrome whatever conceptualisation one has of this phenomenon or theory it is essentially about the consequence of domestic violence on the mental state emotional and physical well being of the battered spouse the accused arrived at the courtroom door through circumstances she appeared to have minimum control and after long years of suffering and brutalisation to face the most serious criminal charge in our penal code the genesis of this crime has to be seen in the abuse meted out to her by her most intimate partner it is a sad reflection of our male oriented society that domestic violence is not seen as the terror it is in many homes in fiji we in fiji together with the rest of the world are currently focused on another kind of terror this deals with guns bombs hijacking and high finance but the terror inflicted on the lives of the many women and children by excessive use of alcohol by fists and boots and weapons readily available around the house are as much insidious as that which gets prime time on tv domestic violence is terror in our backyards imagine the effects on our young and the most vulnerable members of society it is true the dead cannot defend themselves the living have to deal with the consequences of what their loved ones do the poignance of this case is reflected in the daughter dodo who gave evidence and is now burdened with putting her and her mothers life back to some semblance of normalcy she had to come to court to witness her mother stand trial recount the intimate details of her parents relationship and pick up the pieces from here she was the one who tried to reconcile her parents after almost a year of separation she witnessed the death which maybe she could have avoided if only she knew what her mother was suffering from it is also telling that the deceased was seen as a good man who liked his drink shared jokes dirty and otherwise with his male friends those who visited his house to drink grog or alcohol saw his family life as normal however at is now becoming evident from studies by the fiji womens crisis centre academics and other civil society organisations that spousal abuse is a major social problem in fiji it also has economic consequences due to the importance and sanctity of the family in the socio cultural milieu in fiji there is still considerable under reporting of spousal abuse people do not want to intervene in the domestic lives of others this concern for privacy and stigma attached to spousal abuse means that a considerable number of our women and children are deprived of support men themselves remain without counselling and the vicious cycle continues the range of sentencing options for manslaughter in fiji have varied depending on the infinite variety of circumstances learned defense counsel has asked for a suspended sentence learned state counsel has submitted that this case merits the upper scale of the sentencing for manslaughter he did not specify what factors merited such an exercise of discretion by the court it is rare for the courts in fiji to deal with women who commit homicide against their husbands according to a usp study between 1982 to 1992 there were 25 episodes of husbands killing wives in the same period there were only 4 cases where the wife killed her husband adinkrah m 1996 violent encounters a study of homicide patterns in society since 1992 there as no readily available data however it is evident that it remains rare in the above study only one case has similarities to the present case in the case of state v alumita lewatsevu cr case 1 of 1990l the accused wife was also the victim of domestic violence on the day of the killing the deceased husband came home drunk he had an argument with his wife he then beat his wife for roughly 3 hours stopping only after he was exhausted he then got cane knife and threatened to kill the accused when he woke up he left the cane knife beside his bed the accused who had fled the house returned after about 30 minutes and saw her husband still in drunken slumber the court accepted that she could no longer stand his ill treatment of her and she lost control she grabbed the knife and chopped her husbands neck three times she was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment suspended for 3 years in the latest case available and quoted by defense counsel the accused was also sentenced to 2 years suspended for 3 years state v koleta rote hac 005 of 2001s in this case the accused wife was armed with a knife this court had reviewed the authorities and applicable principles of sentencing manslaughter cases in its sentencing in state v ramendra chandra cr case hac 0008 of 1999l and state v samuela nemila josaia nacika cr case hac 0011 of 1998l in the case of samuela nemila josaia nacika the court had also considered the case of kim nam bae v state fca cr app aau 0015 of 1998 this was the only case referred to by learned state counsel in seeking a sentence on the upper scale for manslaughter it is quite clear that the case kim nam bae apart from being a spousal killing has almost no relevance to the present case in that case it was the accused husband who killed his wife arising out of a domestic dispute and where the degree of provocation by the deceased wife was minimal in this case there was extreme provocation no weapons were used the wife apparently snapped due to years of domestic violence and the consequent effect of battered womans syndrome there was minimal time for premeditation after the event she was in deep shock and tatters as prosecution witnesses described her she cooperated with the police and fire authorities at the time of the offence she was diagnosed as suffering from acute stress reaction according to the consultant psychiatrist she had been exposed to an exceptional mental and physical stress this situation was particularly stressful because she was physically sick and disabled with diabetes mellitus hypertension and right sided weakness as a result of stroke she was further provoked into an uncontrollable emotional reaction according to the psychiatrist the court has considered all the relevant authorities available to it on sentencing for manslaughter by the high court it has also considered the sentence appeals from the high court by the court of appeal as the court of appeal has stated the cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and the provocation is minimal kim nam bae supra p 4 the case of state v shakuntla devi cr case hac001 of 2001s is also relevant in this case the accused killed her elder sister who had provoked her the accused was given a suspended sentence the court takes note of the age of the accused her clean record until this offence and her medical condition the court also takes into consideration the fact that she was in remand from DATE to 06107 01 a period of about 2½ years this period of

distressed condition doctor finds fresh lacerations on upper vaginal wall multiple bruises around the neck extra ordinarily pulling of large amount of blood in vagina 3 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment it is now well settled and confirmed by the supreme court in anand abhay raj cav003 2014 that the tariff for rape of a juvenile is 10 15 years of imprisonment 4 the accused at the time of the rape was 18 years an adult in law and the victim was only 17 a juvenile mitigating factors 5 in a comprehensive written submission counsel for the accused submits that the accused is married and he is a father of three year old son he is presently working as a security officer and supports his siblings and his parents on his salary he was in new zealand on a rugby scholarship and has returned to fiji upon completion of the scholarship he has plans to migrate to new zealand to provide his family a better future 6 in the sentencing hearing deacon of the methodist church at tavua mr ratuovini bokini was called by the accused to substantiate facts his counsel had submitted already to this court the deacon said that the accused was closely associated with the church and looking after not only his family but the extended family and neighbours as well he further said he had noticed a change in accuseds way of life for better after his marriage and becoming a father 7 according to the accuseds marriage certificate and his childs birth certificate tendered to court accused has committed this offence after his marriage and when his child was only three months old he has engaged himself in an extra marital sexual conduct for which he is now convicted as a husband and a father against the teachings of the church i am unable to agree with the deacon 8 three year old son will now be looked after by his domestic worker wife long prison sentence of his father will undoubtedly be detrimental to childs upbringing 9 the accused is the first offender and has a clear record hitherto and is young he has co operated during police investigations aggravating factors 10 the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge and maintained that position right throughout the trial by doing so he has not saved the young girl from giving evidence and reliving the ordeal he has thereby not shown remorse and repentance 11 the accused knew of victims vulnerability as a running away girl from home and also her vulnerability as a stranger in tavua victim was a juvenile at the time of the rape he exploited her vulnerability to satisfy his lustful desires even though he was a married man with a baby at the time of the incident 12 in view of accuseds personal circumstances and his prospects of bright future as a young rugger player and also his three year old sons wellbeing i considered before proceeding to sentence the following authorities cited by the defence counsel in mitigation 13 in moses nariva v the state 2006 fjhc haa 0148j 2005 the accused was a young offender of 17 years old juvenile he was a first offender who pleaded guilty without wasting time of court and was remorseful madam justice shameem stated the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender non custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment 14 in state v nayate vatu 2015 fjhc 263 hac 231 2011 DATE justice madigan sentenced a 21 year old for seven years of imprisonment for two counts of juvenile rape with non parole period of five years in rationalizing his finding justice madigan stated it appears to be extremely important in this case that a balance be struck between expectations of the community that such activity be punished and retribution be afforded the victim with the need to recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him her when faced with a serious crime or crimes a court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to follow the same course of action 15 in his concluding remarks justice madigan said i am aware that this final sentence of seven years is below the tariff for rape of a child and it is in no way meant to distort the tariff already recognized by the supreme court it is a lenient sentence in recognition of the youth of the accused and his remorseful plea of guilty saving the child from giving evidence 16 in state v seniqai 2011 fjhc 375 hac 010 2011 DATE justice gounder sentenced a 18 year old rape accused for 5 years of imprisonment below tariff justice gounder imposing imprisonment without fixing a non parole said you are 18 years old unfortunately you are unemployed without any meaningful purpose in life you left school after completing form 4 the international convention on the rights of a child applies to you because of your age i bear in mind that a prison sentence should be the last resort for a child i sentence you to 5 years imprisonment the purpose of your sentence is to denounce your offence and to deter you and others from committing this type of offence due to your youth i do not fix a non parole period 17 there have been instances where judges of the high court have deviated from existing tariff when they find that the sentencing within tariff either disproportionately excessive or unjust in all the circumstances of the case 18 there is no victim impact assessment report before me filed by the state victim is now married sentence 19 having considered all the aspects now i proceed to sentence the accused as follows 20 to reflect the gravity of offending not the offender i take a starting point of 10 years at the bottom of the tariff for this offence to reflect the aggravating features of lack of remorse and exploitation of vulnerability of a young juvenile i add three years to that starting point in recognition of his strong mitigation of clean record time he spent in remand his personal circumstances and his duty to family i deduct those three years bringing the interim sentence back to ten years for his youth and his prospects as a rugger player trained in new zealand on a scholarship i deduct a further two years bringing his sentence down to one of eight years 21 having considered the accuseds future prospects and desire for rehabilitation i order that he serve only five years before he is eligible for parole 22 i concur with the reasoning given by justice madigan in state v nayate

with your elder brother in regards to the paying for the house labourers the argument heated up and you tried to fight with the elder brother the complainant intervened and he pushed you away then you got hold of a glass dish and hit on the nose of the complainant the complainant received injuries and the matter was reported to the police 4 according to the medical report the complainant had received a laceration on his nasal bridge and the doctor had commented that the patient may have permanently deformed nasal bridge the complainant had been treated in the hospital for two days 5 in state v mokubula 2003 fjhc 164 justice shameem stated that on the basis of these authorities the tariff for sentences under section 224 of the penal code is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment in a case of an attack by a weapon the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years depending on the nature of the weapon aggravating factors would be 1 seriousness of the injuries 2 evidence of premeditation or planning 3 length and nature of the attack 4 special vulnerability of the victim mitigating factors would be 1 previous good character 2 guilty plea 3 provocation by the victim 4 apology reparation or compensation 6 in this case you attacked 67 year old your own father who was trying to settle the dispute between you and your elder brother i consider that as an aggravating feature 7 in mitigation you said that you are 42 years single and a priest you said that you seek forgiveness you promised that you will not re offend you further informed court that you have reconciled with the complainant and now live in the same house 8 although you claimed to be a priest your conduct does not seem to fall in line with the conduct of a priest in any event the complainant was present in court and he confirmed reconciliation however it should be noted that this is not an offence which can be reconciled besides you waited for five years until the date of the trial to inform that you have reconciled with your father i do not see any remorse on your part furthermore domestic violence acts of this nature have been repeatedly denounced by courts in state v david batiratu har 01 2012 chief justice gates stated there may have been association here with reconciliation reconciliation is maintained in the criminal procedure decree section 154 it was originally provided for in the criminal procedure code at section 163 the promotion of reconciliation applies only to charges for offences of common assault assault occasioning actual bodily harm criminal trespass or damaging property section 154 of the criminal procedure decree provides a much more detailed section than its predecessor taking into account appropriate forms of apology respect for the victim mandatory counselling rehabilitation promises and undertakings to alter habits or conduct such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs most especially the court must be satisfied that reconciliation is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner this approach gives proper protection to children women or vulnerable persons it also indicates the need for awareness of improper pressures which might be exerted to force through reconciliation i respectfully suggest the old cases approving discounts in sentence for cases where the complainant wished to withdraw are no longer the correct approach see rt peni baleidraiba kevetibau v state 1992 38 flr 110 9 you have 4 previous convictions however i disregard two of them as they are more than ten years ago the incident happened in september 2008 and you pleaded guilty only when the case was taken up for trial on the DATE i cannot consider your plea as a timely plea of guilt 10 in this case i pick my starting point as 2 years for the aggravating feature i enhance the sentence by 6 months for the mitigatory factors i reduce the sentence by 12 months accordingly i impose 18 months imprisonment on you 11 in state v mokubula 2003 fjhc 164 justice shameem further stated that as a matter of principle a suspended sentence is not appropriate for a case of act with intent to cause grievous harm not only because it is contrary to the accepted tariff but also because section 29 3 a of the penal code contains a legislative fetter to the section 29 powers to impose a suspended sentence for crimes of violence 12 however as at now sentencing of persons is regulated by the sentencing and penalties decree no 42 of 2009 although the offence in this case is committed prior to the sentencing and penalties decree as per the transitional provisions set out in section 61 of the sentencing and penalties decree i decide that section 29 3 of the penal code has no relevancy anymore 13 yet i do not think that the circumstances of this case and the guidelines set out by previous court decisions warrant a non custodial sentence to be imposed on you the courts have time and again shown disinclination to impose non custodial sentences for grievous harm charges 14 in the circumstances i impose 18 months imprisonment on you 28 days to appeal

18 years and 10 years he ran a small canteen at delaitokatoka suva he reached class 3 level education the complainant was a 6 years old child living in the neighbourhood with her family on DATE after 5 pm her mother sent her to the accuseds canteen to buy some mango skin when she reached the canteen the accused was returning from his shopping they went inside the canteen the complainant told the accused she wanted to buy some mango skin the accused took the money from her and suddenly pulled her to his room 3 he then forcefully took off her clothes the accused then licked the childs vagina he then lay on top of her and rubbed his penis on her vagina in his police caution interview statement he admitted he wanted to penetrate the complainants vagina questions and answers 26 27 and 28 he later ejaculated the complainant ran out of his room and informed her mother the matter was reported to police she was medically examined the same day at cwm hospital the accused was later charged for the current offences 4 the court checked with defence counsel to see that all the elements of the offences were admitted by the accused defence counsel said the accused admitted he attempted to rape the child complainant at the material time they were aware that she was incapable of giving her consent as a matter of law defence counsel also admitted on behalf of the accused that he sexually assaulted the child complainant by licking her vagina as a result of the above admissions the court found the accused guilty as charged on count no 1 and 2 and convicted him accordingly 5 section 208

offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed 1 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment section 207 1 of the crimes decree 2009 the tariff for the rape of a child is a sentence between 10 to 15 years imprisonment see mohammed kasim v the state criminal appeal no 21 of 1993 fiji court of appeal mark

of 2010 high court lautoka in my view to reconcile the above authorities the dictates of section 44 1 of the crimes decree 2009 must be followed it is arguable that previous case authorities limiting the tariff for attempted rape to 1 to 5 years imprisonment may be overtaken by the effect of section 44 1 abovementioned 2 section 210 1 a and 2 of the crimes decree 2009 prescribes a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for sexual assault that involved the licking of the complainants vagina i accept what his lordship mr justice paul madigan said in state v abdul khaiyum criminal case no hac 160 of 2010 that the tariff should be a sentence between 2 to 8 years imprisonment with the higher sentence reserved for the more serious sexual assaults and the low sentence on the less serious assaults 3 the aggravating factors in this case were as follows i this was an abuse of a 6 years old child children are always vulnerable and the courts have repeatedly said they will act to protect children in society by passing severe sentence ii this was also a breach of trust case canteen owners in a neighborhood always stand in a position of trust to children who are sent to buy items from their shop the accuseds offending violates that trust iii the accuseds offendings amounted to violating the rights of this child to live peacefully and happily in the neighbourhood 4 the mitigating factors were as follows i you pleaded guilty to the offence although this was 12 months after the first call in court you nevertheless saved the courts time and the need for the complainant to re live her ordeal in the courtroom by giving evidence ii at the age of 41 years this is your first offence iii you have been remanded in custody since your first appearance in the nasinu magistrate court on

269275,judgment of the court gates p 1 on DATE in the nasinu magistrates court the petitioner was convicted of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the penal code the offence was committed against his biological sister aged 23 on DATE he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment the magistrate had purported partially to suspend the sentence ordering imprisonment at the corrections centre for the weekends only this was clearly an incorrect sentence for the penal code only permitted the suspension of sentences of imprisonment where the term is for not more than 2 years section 29 1 penal code the governing provision at date of sentence was section 26 2 b of the sentencing and penalties act which had similar restrictions on suspension 2 the grounds of appeal against sentence were contained in a letter to this court the petitioner complains of i the declaration of the magistrates court sentence by the court of appeal as being unlawful ii the failure to consider section 18 2 of the sentencing and penalties act before imposing the 7 year non parole period and that the sentence was harsh and excessive iii that the non parole period was a penalty not in force at the time of the offence and therefore a breach of sections 392 and 393 of the crimes act the facts 3 when the matter of sentence was taken on appeal by the director of public prosecutions to the high court the facts were related by the judge in his judgment as follows 6 the facts of the case were that the accused an ex police officer was celebrating with his friends a police win in a rugby match the celebrations had been on going for some time and it is not in dispute that the accused was heavily intoxicated he was aged 32 at the time he had heard rumours that his biological sister who was the victim in this case then aged 22 was involved in a lesbian relationship and he summonsed her to his home he questioned her about this relationship and she denied it he told her that he would do something to her to make her forget she was a lesbian she attempted to run away from him and ran onto the street outside in the sight of neighbours and his drinking friends he chased her and caught her and put her in so much fear that she lost control of her bladder and bowels he took her back into the house his wife was there and she made the sister clean herself up after which the accused kept her in a locked bedroom over a period of three hours while he subjected her to sexual indignities and penile rape his wife was at all times inside an adjacent room the accused when giving evidence of the matter says that he was too drunk to remember the details but he did remember having sex with somebody but could not remember who with ground 1 sentence was lawful 4 the magistrate s order to make the 8 years term of imprisonment a suspended term to be served partially in the community with weekends in the prison was not a lawful sentence it was not permitted by virtue of section 26 2 b of the sentencing and penalties act that section reads 26 1 on sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending for a period specified by the court the whole or part of the sentence if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances 2 a court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence a does not exceed 3 years in the case of the high court or b does not exceed 2 years in the case of the magistrate s court 5 i believe the petitioner understands that the sentence was unlawful in that where a head sentence is as high as 8 years imprisonment it is not a sentence permitted by law to be suspended ground 1 is to be rejected ground 2 failure of high court and court of appeal to consider section 18 2 harsh and excessive 6 the learned resident magistrate when considering sentence did not consider fixing a non parole period section 18 sentencing and penalties act the section provides 18 1 subject to sub section 2 when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole 2 if a court considers that the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender make the fixing of a non parole period inappropriate the court may decline to fix a non parole period under sub section 1 3 if a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for a term of less than 2 years but not less than one year the court may fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole 4 any non parole period fixed under this section must be at least 6 months less than the term of the sentence 7 he could have considered the issue and declined to impose such a period by reason of the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender section 18 2 he simply did not go into this issue 8 upon appeal the learned high court judge imposed a non parole period on the modified head sentence of 17 years of 15 years there was no past history of offending or of offending in this grave category of offences serious sexual misconduct specifically rape we can be sure therefore it was the nature of the offence and the unsavoury and horrific circumstances of this crime that caused him to see the need for fixing a lengthy non parole period 9 the court of appeal recognising that the high court upon an appeal was confined to a sentence within the limited powers of the magistrates court came back down to the original head sentence of 8 years imprisonment 10 the court of appeal in livai nawalu v the state cr app cav0012 2012 DATE at para 4 had explained as follows 24 v the appeal court must if it substitutes its own sentence on appeal or by way of revision of the magistrates court s sentence keep within the powers of the magistrates court the high court cannot substitute a magistrates court sentence with one which only the high court can impose the magistrate is limited to a maximum term of imprisonment on each offence of 5 years section 7 cpc now 10 years section 7 1 a cpd and in total to 14 years where there are two or more distinct offences section 12 cpc and section 7 2 cpd an exception would lie where legislation has specifically enhanced the power of the magistrate to sentence beyond the usual limit 11 had this been an original sentence in the high court for rape of an adult the term to be imposed would have been within the tariff of between 7 15 years imprisonment this point was clear to both the high court and the court of appeal the learned magistrate could have sent the case to the high court for sentence the circumstances of this crime were shocking and appalling the offending should have been met with condign punishment and marked society s firm rebuke 12 the suggestion therefore that the eventual sentence settled by the court of appeal at 8 years head sentence with a 7 year non parole period was harsh and excessive is to be strongly rejected ground 3 penalty of fixing non parole period not in force at time of sentence sentence in breach of sections 392 393 crimes act 13 a similar issue came up in the case of naitini v the state 2016 fjsc 6 cav0034 2015 DATE in referring to the sentencing and penalties act keith j at para 11 said it had been enacted by DATE which was the date on which naitini was sentenced and the judge was on the face of it entitled to fix a non parole period because of one of the transitional provisions in the sentencing and penalties decree that is section 61 1 which provides a court hearing any proceeding for an offence which was commenced prior to the commencement of this decree shall apply the provisions of this decree if no sentence has been imposed on the offender prior to the commencement of this decree 14 section 392 2 of the crimes act provides when imposing sentences for any offence under the penal code which was committed prior to the commencement of this decree the court shall apply the penalties prescribed for that offence by the penal code 15 however the nature of an order fixing a non parole period has been categorised by this court as not amounting to additional punishment maya v the state 2015 fjsc 30 at para 27 it was said the fixing of a non parole period did not amount to additional punishment of the kind which section 3 2 of the crimes decree outlawed it was the court s attempt to ensure that maya would not be released from prison earlier than the court thought appropriate whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission 16 by way of elaboration of that reasoning keith j said at para 17 i do not think that the fixing of a non parole period amounts to punishment the punishment which naitini got were the two head sentences the fixing of the non parole period did not increase those sentences it only affected when he might be eligible for release by the operation of the current practice relating to remission prior to the expiry of the head sentences but that did not make the fixing of the none parole period punishment 17 the section 392 argument was also laid to rest in maya keith j added at para 19 i turn to naitini s reliance on section 392 2 of the crimes decree this was a case in which section 392 2 of the crimes decree required the court to apply the penalties prescribed for naitini s offences by the penal code those penalties were the head sentences he received assuming that section 392 2 required the court to apply only the penalties prescribed by the penal code the question is whether the fixing of a non parole period amounted to a penalty i do not think that it did for the same reason that it did not amount to punishment the non parole period did not increase the head sentences it only affected the date when naitini might otherwise have been released by the operation of the current practice relating to remission 18 fixing a non parole period is not a novelty after the passing of section 18 of the sentencing and penalties act formerly there was section 33 to consider under the repealed penal code 19 keith j saw no real distinction his lordship concluded the discussion this way at para 22 secondly naitini s arguments do not take into account the court s power in section 33 of the penal code to fix the minimum period an offender had to serve it is true that the court only had the power under section 33 to fix the minimum period for offenders who commit certain offences whereas it was obliged under section 18 of the sentencing and penalties decree to fix a non parole period for offenders sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a term of two years or more but that is a distinction without a difference for present purposes the fact is that even if it could be said that the fixing of a non parole period amounted to a punishment or a penalty additional to the head sentence the power to fix a minimum period which the offender had to serve was available to the court both before the repeal of the penal code and afterwards emphasis added 20 that conclusion disposes of ground 3 and this court must reject that ground 21 none of the grounds raise matters in which the criteria for leave to appeal are met the petition must therefore be declined marsoof j 22 i have read the judgment of gates p in draft and agree that for the reasons set out in the said judgment leave to appeal has to be refused

incident 11 from the above mr reddy submits that the court considers a non custodial sentence as there are special circumstances namely the accused is nursing a 3 month old baby who is breastfed husband is reconciled with the accused nature of the offending is such that there no outside persons who had been victimised 12 ms tabete for the state was gracious in conceding that from a holistic approach and given the family and domestic nature of the offending in this case coupled with you guilty plea evidencing your willingness to accept responsibility a non custodial sentence may not be inappropriate she further submitted that the state is concerned about the rights of the 3 month old baby to be with the mother at this very vulnerable stage especially when she needs to be breast fed 13 she also opined to the court that if the court was considering a non custodial sentence that the court take appropriate steps to protects the interest of the victim child having to live in a home with parents who may be violent towards him the sentence 14 i now turn to consider the sentence for each count of the offence charged against the accused for count 1 with regard to act with intent to cause grievous harm contrary to section 224 a of the penal code cap 17 the liable penalty is life imprisonment 15 in the state v mokubula 2003 fjhc 164 justice shameem reviewed several court of appeal and high court cases on sentencing with regard to offences under section 224 of the penal code cap 17 on that basis the learned judge concluded on the basis of these authorities the tariff for sentences under section 224 of the penal code 17 is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment in a case of an attack by a weapon the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years depending on the nature of the weapon 16 in this case the need to ensure that young children who at vulnerable age need to be protected by the court especially against violent parents and the seriousness with which parliament considers offences of this kind in imposing life imprisonment as the maximum penalty i would chose 2 years imprisonment as the starting point of the sentence in this case 17 i have carefully considered the mitigating factors submitted by mr reddy on behalf of the accused i accept those factors which i are referred to above i would reduce the sentence by 6 months imprisonment leaving a sentence of 18 months imprisonment 18 i have taken the following aggravating factors into consideration the fact that the victim is a vulnerable 14 month old boy use of a burning mosquito coil to inflict serious injury on the young boy the fact that the young boy was an innocent victim of the accused problems frustration with her husband for the above aggravating factors i would increase the sentence by 12 months imprisonment to 30 months 19 for the guilty plea and its consequence in saving the court s time and resources i would further discount the term of imprisonment by 10 months the term of imprisonment in this case is 1 year 8 months 20 with regard to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 245 of the penal code cap 17 i would take the starting point of the sentence as 9 months imprisonment i would reduce it by 4 months for the mitigation and increase it by 6 months for the aggravating factors for the guilty plea i would further discount the sentence by 3 months to 8 months imprisonment 21 both sentences are to be served concurrently this would mean a total sentence of 1 year 8 months imprisonment for both counts

there are special circumstances that warrant such a decision in considering the issue of suspending or not of the term of imprisonment in this case i noted the fact that the husband of the accused is reconciled with her and the best interest not only of the victim but of all three children especially the 3 month old baby that their mother is not separate from them i find support in this from the observation of justice pathik in prem chand v the state 1979 fca 30 1997 43 flr 217 i am satisfied that the following factors constitutes special circumstances sufficient for the court to suspend the term of imprisonment in this case the accused has already served 2 months in prison custody while awaiting trial the accused now has a 3 month old baby son who is breast fed and needs her mother the accused have demonstrated through her own initiative to address her own deficiency as a parent by seeking counseling for anger management and to be followed by marriage guidance counselling through

82532,sentence 1 peniame roligalevu you stand convicted of rape and defilement of a 14 year old victim at narocake village in rewa 2 on the night of DATE the victim was grabbed and pulled behind a house when she was returning to her bedroom after visiting the washroom outside her home you threw her on the ground and undressed her you gagged her mouth with your hand to prevent her from screaming you jabbed her down with your hand and thighs and raped her 3 two months later on the night of DATE you entered the victims bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her this time she did not resist you knew she was under the age of 16 years when you had sex with her 4 you were an authority figure over the victim by relationship and age she was your younger brothers stepdaughter who had come to live with her mother when she married your brother apart from her mother she did not have any other relatives in narocake village the victim and her mother are originally from macuata vanua levu when the incidents happened the victim did not complain to anyone but village gossips and rumors led her mother to confront her in december 2010 by that time the victim had moved out of the village the victim admitted the sexual assaults to her mother her mother immediately reported the matter to the police 5 the events that transpired afterwards are unfortunate there was an existing conflict between you and the complainants stepfather over your family home the complainants stepfather and her mother occupied the family home when the offences were committed the allegations of sexual assaults against you by the stepdaughter of your brother further divided the family members your father held the traditional title of matanivanua in the village he was the village spokesperson by tradition the title of matanivanua is considered important in the village context and is passed on to the brothers or sons the allegations of sexual assaults against you must have been embarrassing for your family 6 i have no doubt in my mind that the traditional status of your father gave you the authority and influence in the village by age you were older than the complainants stepfather the court was told that eventually the complainants mother and stepfather moved out of the family home and built their own home on a neighbouring land for the victims mother her loyalty was divided between her husbands family and her daughter she ended up presenting a bulubulu presentation of yaqona as a form of traditional apology to all members of your household including your father for reporting the sexual assaults to the police the victim attended the bulubulu ceremony but her participation was not voluntary as would have been expected of any 14 year old daughter she felt obliged to participate and she did attend the ceremony to please her mother 7 after the traditional apology the victims mother made her sign a statutory declaration withdrawing her complaint of sexual assaults against you at trial the victims mother gave evidence for you your father and your sister in law also supported you the court accepted the victims version of facts that she signed the declaration without knowing its contents 8 the young victim stood alone to give evidence she was extensively cross examined and accused of fabricating the sexual assaults against you but she stood her ground and said she was raped and defiled by you it must have taken a lot of courage for her to stand her ground knowing the consequences of telling the truth might come at a cost for her and her mother 9 in our country we take pride in our customs and traditions customs and traditions should never be used to restrict access to justice if anything customs and traditions should be a medium to correct the harm done to the victim by making the offender accountable without accountability relationships cannot be restored no matter how much traditional apology is offered this is an exceptional case where customs and traditions were exploited to suppress the truth 10 under the domestic and international law the state has positive obligation to bring the perpetrators of sexual assaults against children to justice children are vulnerable members of our society they must be protected from sexual abuse for this reason the court cannot condone any form of sexual abuse against children 11 the offences you committed are serious rape attracts maximum sentence of life imprisonment defilement is punishable by 10 years imprisonment 12 the victim was a child the courts in fiji have repeatedly said that sexual assaults against children will be met by severe punishment to denounce and deter such offences 13 in drotini v state 2006 fjca 26 aau0001 2005s DATE the court of appeal provided sentencing guidelines for rape of a child by a family member the court said at p3 there are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust the seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family if the child then remains in the family home the rapist often has the oportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family cases of rape by fathers or stepfathers appear before the courts in fiji far too frequently and in such cases the starting point should be increased to ten years where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature threats of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police there should be substantial increases above that starting point 14 sentencing for defilement is approached by determining whether there was a virtuous relationship between the offender and the victim the age gap between the offender and the victim and any breach of trust rokowaqa ca 37 2004 kabaura hac 117 2010 donumainasuva ca 32 2001 and raibevu hac 27 2011 15 your relationship with the victim was of trust that trust was violated when you sexually abused her on two occasions the subsequent attempt to deflect your prosecution by using customs and traditions further aggravated your offending rather than you being remorse for your conduct you further victimized her by making her offer a traditional apology to you she was the victim not you if there should have been any apology it should have come from you 16 your pastor gave evidence of your character you are a christian by faith you have previous convictions but they are irrelevant for the purpose of sentencing in this case i take into account your personal circumstances and your good character as mitigating factors you are married with 7 children you are 36 years old you support your family by farming and fishing any prison sentence will cause financial hardship to your wife and children but i am not satisfied that the hardship will be exceptional as to operate as a mitigating factor 17 for the offence of rape i use 10 years as my starting point i increase the sentence to 15 years to reflect the aggravating factors and reduce it to 12 years to reflect the mitigating factors i sentence you to 12 years imprisonment for rape and i fix a non parole period for 10 years 18 for the offence of defilement i use 5 years as my starting point after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors i sentence you to 4 years imprisonment for defilement to be served concurrently with the sentence for rape 19 your total

division with intent to annoy the said prashant levaci kumar exhibited pornographic material using his mobile phone intending that such exhibition be seen by the said prashant levaci kumar which offended his modesty the appellant was sentenced on each count to 20 months 6 months to be served in prison and remaining 14 months suspended for 5 years the sentences of imprisonment were to be served concurrently the appellant appeals on following grounds that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact when he selected the starting point at the higher end of the tariff which led the sentence being harsh and excessive that the learned magistrate erred in law and in a fact when he did not give cogent reasons as to the selection of the starting point that the learned magistrate failed to consider that the maximum penalty for the offence of indecently annoying a person is 12 months imprisonment and the final sentence being more than the maximum penalty prescribed in the crimes act no 44 that the learned magistrate failed to consider a suspended sentence as the petitioner was a first offender that the learned magistrate failed to consider section 4 1 and 2 of the sentencing and penalties act 2009 thus the sentence to be harsh and excessive facts the victim was 10 year old student at the time of the offence the appellant who is a neighbour of the victim had invited the victim to accompany him to the shop the victim had hesitantly agreed to go to the shop with the appellant on half way to the shop the appellant had asked the victim to suck his dick for money the victim then went back home and when he was about to have a bath the appellant had come home and showed pornographic material stored in his phone the victim reported the matter to a friend who eventually reported the matter to victim s mother the victim said it was annoying and disgusting law it is well established law that before this court can disturb the sentence the appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion if the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him if he mistakes the facts if he does not take into account some relevant consideration then the appellate court may impose a different sentence this error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself bae v state 1999 fjca 21 aau0015u 98s DATE house v the king 1936 hca 40 1936 55 clr 499 analysis all grounds can be considered together as they challenge the sentence on the basis that it was harsh and excessive the maximum penalty for indecently annoying another is imprisonment for one year there is no set tariff for this offence in state v yabakiono 2016 fjhc 383 hac77 20 DATE madigan j observed the maximum penalty for indecently annoying another is imprisonment for one year without a tariff having been set nor need there be one there are a myriad ways in which a person can be sexually harassed and the sentence will be at the discretion of the court hearing the matter the appellant contends that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact when he selected the starting point at the higher end of the tariff which led the sentence being harsh and excessive the learned magistrate took 16 months as the starting point as madigan j observed in yabakiono supra there is no set tariff for this offence the learned magistrate had selected a starting point above the maximum penalty for the offence generally when a tariff is set it is set below the maximum penalty for the offence and according to recommendation by the court of appeal in koroivuki v state 2013 fjca 15 aau0018 20 DATE the starting point should be picked from the middle or lower range of the tariff however the maximum penalty for this offence being imprisonment period of one year and no tariff being set i do not see a need to apply the koroivuki principle to this case as madigan j observed in yabakiono supra there are a myriad ways in which a person can be sexually harassed and the sentence will be at the discretion of the court hearing the matter however selecting a starting point of 16 months above the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislation is illegal and wrong in principle having selected a starting point as high as 16 months the learned magistrate increased 4 months on account of aggravating factors at paragraph 6 of the sentencing ruling the learned magistrate stated as aggravation factor i found that this is an insult on a young offender and therefore increase your sentence by 4 months in reflecting the same the counsel for appellant argues that the charge itself has the word insult in it or already incorporated in the offence and therefore the learned magistrate had double counted the same aggravating factor to punish the appellant twice for this aggravating feature it is also contended that by selecting a higher starting point the court had already considered this aggravating feature at tier one of the sentencing process the learned magistrate had increased the sentence by 4 months because of the said aggravating fact it has to be accepted that the word insult and annoy carry slightly different meanings insult is a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action annoy is to irritate someone or to make someone a little angry however both actions are intended to make someone angry therefor i concede that insult is incorporated in the offence itself i also accept that the said aggravating feature is deemed to have subsumed in the higher starting point selected however the appellant has insulted a child who was only 10 years old at the time of the offence therefore taking into consideration the age of the victim as an aggravating factor is not wrong in principle although an increase of 4 months may not be justified given the higher starting point selected by the learned magistrate it should however be noted that there are other aggravating feature in this offending which the learned magistrate failed to appreciate the learned magistrate has failed to consider the age gap between the offender and the victim and also the relationship between them the appellant is a neighbour of the child victim and the victim had placed much trust on the appellant when he agreed to go to shop with him the appellant is also guilty in repeating this offence the child victim was also vulnerable however i take the view that the final sentence of 20 months imprisonment above the maximum penalty prescribed by the crimes act is illegal the learned magistrate has not given any discount in mitigation only because the appellant had failed to file his mitigation despite an opportunity to do so was given however the appellant was a first offender and therefore he deserved a discount on that account the learned state counsel agrees that the sentence is excessive bearing in mind the maximum sentence prescribed by the legislation and the sentencing practice in the past he feels that the sentence ought to be reduced with learned state counsel not opposing the appeal in all the circumstances of this case i also consider that the sentence should be on the high side for this type of offending therefore having considered all aspects of the offence appellant and the victim i would quash the sentence and impose a fresh sentence that is lawful and proportionate to the offences the appellant had committed although the maximum penalty prescribed by the statute is one year when i read the record of proceedings in this case i found the circumstances to be serious when the appellant committed the first offence he had attempted to have his penis sucked by a child for money when he failed to satisfy his lustful demand he had shown pornographic material to corrupt the innocent mind of a child so that he could meet his demand having considered the seriousness of the offence and the harm caused to a child victim i select a starting point of 8 months for aggravating circumstances discussed above i add 3 months bringing the interim sentence to 11 months imprisonment appellant is a first offender i deduct one month in mitigation now the final sentence is 10 months imprisonment i therefore set aside the sentence of 20 months imprisonment and substitute it with a sentence of 10 months imprisonment on each count the learned magistrate at paragraph 8 of his ruling considered whether the sentence should be suspended as required by section 26 of the sentencing and penalties act spa because the final imprisonment period fell below 2 years the appellant argues that the whole sentence should have been suspended because the appellant was a first offender and therefore the principle of rehabilitation should have been the primary purpose of the sentencing process i do not agree with this proposition the learned magistrate had suspended 14 months of the sentence and ordered an immediate custodial sentence of 6 months i think the learned magistrate was right when he imposed an immediate custodial sentence of six months given the circumstances of this case the principle of rehabilitation should be rightly balanced with other purposes articulated in section 4 1 of the spa the victim is a vulnerable child and a clear message has to be sent to the society and to the offender that this kind of offences will be dealt with severely by courts special and general deterrence should be the primary purpose of the sentence the protection of community specially the need to protect children who are highly vulnerable in our society has to be given special consideration by courts when it comes to sentencing an offender in a sex related cases the breach of trust on the part of the appellant as an adult neigbour is also a matter to be reckoned with and also the appellant has never been remorseful the learned magistrate has cited state v nadolo 2012 fjhc 1444 hac143 10 DATE where nawana j observed section 4 of the decree on sentencing guidelines has been founded on the jurisprudential principle of balancing competing interests of the offender the victim and the society at large state v tilalevu 2010 fjhc 258 hac 81 of 2010 20 07 2010 it is therefore of paramount importance for any sentence to reflect courts bounden duty of protecting the community and its unhesitant approach of denouncing the commission of the offence within the prescribed parameters under the law this can be manifested only by deterring the offenders and others who tempt to commit crime for all of the reasons stated above i take the view that the immediate custodial sentence of six months is not disproportionate to the offence the appellant has committed the appellant was sentenced by the learned magistrate on the DATE having considered the position took up by the state and the illegality of the sentence the appellant was released on bail by this court on DATE therefore he had served nearly one month in prison prior to the bail determination therefore i deduct one month from the imprisonment period following orders are

accordingly he was convicted on all the charges 03 in this case the victim was 07 years old child and the accused is her step grandfather she was in class 01 when accused poked his finger in to her vagina the accused committed the offence for some time after threatening the victim 04 the medical evidence revealed that the hymen of the victim is not intact the doctor expressed an opinion that this is unusual considering the age of the victim 05 accused took up the position that he never poked his finger into victims vagina and therefore denied the charges 06 as per section 207 1 2 b of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 the maximum sentence for an offence of rape is imprisonment for life tariff for rape 07 in the case of chand v state 2007 aau005 2006s DATE the court referred to the case of mohammed kasim v the state appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed we consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage 08 in sireli v state 2008 fjca 86 aau0098 of 2008s DATE the court also referred to the case of state v lasaro turagabeci others hac 0008 of 1996 the court observed the courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences it violates and degrades a fellow human being the physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe the courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma the increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence 09 in the case of drotini v the state 2006 fjca 26 aau0001 2005 DATE the court noted following there are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust the seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family if the child then remains in the family home the rapist often had the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family cases of rape by fathers or step fathers appear before the court in fiji far too frequently and in such cases the starting point should be increased to ten years where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature threat of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police there should be substantial increases above that starting point 10 in state v av 2009 fjhc24 hac 192 20 DATE the court stated rape is the most serious form of sexual assault in this case a child was raped society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children children are our future the courts have a positive obligation under the constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences 11 the accused is 63 years of age lived with his step daughters and sons family he is a retired public works department worker he has been in remand since his arrest 12 in okeefe v state 2007 fjhc 34 the fiji court of appeal held that the following principle of sentencing when sentencing in individual cases the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person 13 i have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree no 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence 14 section 15 3 of the sentencing decree provides that as a general principle of sentencing a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4 and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the general sentencing provisions of the decree 15 the objectives of sentencing as found in section 4 1 of the decree are as follows 1 to punish offenders to an extent and a manner which is just in all the circumstances 2 to protect the community from offenders 3 to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature 4 to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated 5 to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences or 6 any combination of these purposes 16 section 4 2 of the decree further provides that in sentencing offenders a court must have regarded to a the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence b current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline judgments c the nature and gravity of the particular offence d the defenders culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence e the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury loss or damage resulting from the offence f whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence and if so the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so 17 now i consider the aggravating factors 1 the accused is the step grandfather of the victim 2 the accused seriously disregarded and breached the trust between him and the victim 1 accused was 62 years old and victim was 7 years old at the time of first incident 1 the accused took advantage of the trust that the victim had placed on him 1 the lack of remorse demonstrated by the accused person for what the victim has suffered emotionally physically as reflected in the medical findings 2 the accused made the victim to re live the ordeal again in court in its raw form 3 the accused made the victim sexually active at very

75927,judgment of the court 1 this is an appeal against conviction and sentence 2 the appellant was charged with one count of rape at suva on DATE he pleaded not guilty at his trial in the high court he appeared on his own behalf he crossed examined the state witnesses unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of his caution and charge statements and gave evidence in his own defence the three assessors unanimously found him guilty the judge accepted that opinion later on DATE the appellant was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment he now appeals the prosecution case 3 the case for the state relied on the complainant s evidence the evidence of her husband of a recent complaint made to him in the early hours of the morning following the rape and the appellant s confessional statements 4 the complainant is a married women living with her husband and children on DATE the appellant whom she said that she had not seen before came to her home at about 1 pm he said that he was looking for a house girl named laota who worked for a european couple he told the complainant that the house girl had not turned up for work and that if he could not find her he needed a replacement the appellant was to speak to his boss 5 the complainant said that she was interested in obtaining work she told the appellant that she wanted to speak to her husband about the proposed wages which she would receive if she took the job the complainant s husband came home at about 5 30pm that day she spoke to him about the matter the appellant returned later to speak to the husband about the terms of the complainant s proposed employment 6 on the following day DATE the complainant said that she went with the appellant by bus to suva they then took a taxi and stopped outside a white house which was closed they then went to a public telephone where the appellant so he told the complainant called his boss who told him to wait until 8 pm 7 afterwards they went to a taxi stand near the hospital and from there to what the appellant described as his boss office they stopped at a house the appellant told her to go under the house to avoid harm as male voices had been heard later they moved out from under the house and it was at that time according to the complainant that the appellant picked up a glass louvre blade and threatened her in her evidence in chief she described what happened in this way he told me not to speak he pulled me and said go to another house he said come closer to me he said he would kill me he showed louvre blade to me i said i didn t realize he would do this i said i have got a family i love my two children don t do that shut up not to speak he pulled me and tried to kiss me he put his hand inside my blouse and started to fondle my breasts i could not do anything as i was afraid he might kill me with louvre blade he told me to remove my underwear i said i cannot i am having my period he then removed my panty he took me to a smooth surface he moved my thighs apart he came on top of me he put his penis into my vagina and he had sex with me he pulled up his long trousers he told me to put on my panty told me to sit there a while then look

out the appellant closed her mouth pulled her hair and put the louvre blade to her neck 9 the complainant ultimately arrived home at about 3 am having travelled part of the way in a taxi with the appellant when she arrived home she woke her husband and told him what had happened to her the appellant was to call on the following morning the complainant and her husband then planned to trap him when he called 10 in the morning the appellant called the complainant said that she told the appellant that her husband was at work the appellant then went away but later came back this time the complainant s husband was waiting for him there was a confrontation the complainant s husband punched the appellant and then they took him to the police station 11 under cross examination by the appellant the complainant denied knowing him for 3 months prior to these events she denied saying to the appellant that her husband was cruel to her and that he was not working further she denied that she told the appellant to look for a house to rent so that they could live together several times she denied that she was lying to the court 12 when the complainant was asked by the appellant did she scream she replied i could not shout out for help because you said that you will kill me with piece of glass she was asked why she had not complained to the security guards when a taxi was being obtained she replied that she had not done so because the appellant would run away she gave the same reason for not complaining to the taxi driver and at a police check point during the taxi trip she wanted to tell her husband first 13 the complainant was medically examined at the request of the police the doctor who examined the complainant had left fiji by the time of the trial the doctor s report was introduced into evidence by another doctor at the request of the appellant and with his consent the report stated that the examination did not disclose any sign of injury although the doctor producing the report observed that the absence of injury did not exclude rape and that rape could occur without injury 14 the complainant s husband deposed that he had not met the appellant before the day that he called to discuss a new job for his wife he confirmed that there had been an evening conversation with the appellant on 21 july and that on the following day the appellant was to take the complainant to meet his that is the appellant s boss 15 the complainant s husband described the complainant s condition when she came home in the early hours of the morning he said that she was crying unsteady and scared she then complained to him that she had been raped by the appellant 16 the complainant s husband confirmed that when the appellant visited the house in the morning there had been an altercation between the two of them 17 at the police station the appellant made caution and charge statements as we have stated earlier the appellant challenged the admissibility of both statements on the grounds that they had been unfairly and oppressively obtained the judge held a voir dire in evidence on the voir dire the appellant claimed that he was assaulted by two police officers that he was stripped naked that he was forced to the floor and that he had a leg put to his stomach these allegations of violence were denied by the police officers the judge preferred the evidence of the police officers and rejected the appellant s allegations he ruled that the statements were voluntarily obtained that there was no element of unfairness and that there was no breach of the constitution 18 the caution statement contained a full confession by the appellant he admitted going to see the complainant to ascertain if she was interested in being a house girl he said that he met her on the next day and that he was with her on that day he admitted having sex with the complainant without her consent instead of arranging a job he admitted threatening her with a broken glass louvre blade and blocking her mouth with his hands he identified a piece of broken louvre glass recovered from the rape scene his statement contained a description of going to the complainant s house on the following day and being punched by the complainant s husband towards the end of the caution statement he said what i did with the complainant i feel sorry for that and next time i am not going to do with anybody 19 after the appellant was charged he made a charge statement in which he said i want the court to forgive me for what i did i admit having sex with the complainant i am sorry for what i had done to her the defence case 20 the appellants case at the trial was in complete conflict with the case for the state 21 the appellant as we have said gave evidence in his own defence he claimed that the complaint was a false one rather so the appellant asserted there had been an on going secret relationship between the appellant and the complainant for sometime before DATE in contrast to the complainant who had said that she had only met the appellant for the first time on the day when he came to the house he claimed in evidence that he was very close to the complainant in his friendship with her and that indeed he had started going to her house and sleeping there during the day when her husband was not there he described going to the town with the complainant waiting for a woman called loata to turn up loata failing to turn up having a meal with the complainant taking her in a taxi and dropping her at her place when she asked him to call at 9 am on the following day 22 the appellant denied having sex with the complainant as alleged but he said that they had had sex on previous occasions he denied being involved in a fight with the complainant s husband although he admitted being in the complainant s home on the morning after the visit to the town before the assessors he repeated his allegations of violence by the police finding of guilty 23 plainly both the assessors and later the judge believed the complainant and disbelieved the appellant hence the finding of guilty appeal against conviction 24 we deal first with the appeal against conviction the appellant s grounds of appeal as distilled from his letter to the court complain of the following errors in law and in fact a in accepting the complainants evidence when there were inconsistencies between her police statement and her evidence in court b in accepting the complainants evidence when there was no sign of injury and lack of medical corroboration to indicate that sexual activity had occurred c in not allowing the appellant time to seek representation and in proceeding with the trial without the appellant having legal representation when he had no knowledge of the law d in not giving the appellant the opportunity and facilities needed to prepare a defence e in remanding the appellant for almost five months occasioning an unfair trial 25 we here note that there was no complaint about the admission of the confessional statements 26 we shall now deal with each of these complaints in turn a inconsistencies in the complainants evidence 27 the appellant does not identify the inconsistencies he refers to in any event he did not during his cross examination of the complainant seek to impeach her credit by reference to her police statement indeed there was no cross examination as to her police statement prior to the trial there had been the usual pre trial disclosure we consider that the appellant cannot now on appeal refer to the complainant s police statement in an endeavour to undermine her credibility even if he could demonstrate inconsistencies she was not cross examined on them 28 in our view the assessors were properly directed by the judge as to how they should deal with the facts the complainant gave evidence which appeared to be credible there was evidence of a recent complaint from the husband which was consistent with her account of the events of the night the assessors and later the judge were entitled to prefer her evidence to that of the appellant as well there were the confessional statements of the appellant now unchallenged which were confirmatory of the complaint s evidence this ground therefore fails b lack of injury 29 the appellant relied on the medical report of the doctor who examined the complainant it will be recalled that report was admitted with the consent of the appellant as the examining doctor was no longer in fiji the examining doctor had recorded that there was no sign of injury on the complainant the appellant contended that there was a lack of medical corroboration of any sexual activity that that fatally undermined credibility of the complainant and that the complainant s evidence ought not to have been accepted on that account 30 in this context it is to be remembered that the doctor who was called by the state to produce the report deposed that the absence of injury does not exclude rape as a woman could be frightened and in any event injury need not occur 31 summing up the judge directed the assessors in the past fiji has relied heavily on the need to corroborate the statement of a female victim that she was raped it was said in the past that it was dangerous to convict on the female victim s evidence alone that s because the law traditionally and for very old and unworthy reasons said that complaints of sexual assault by women may not always be reliable thankfully that position has now changed as a result of a recent court of appeal decision in fiji so just in case you think in this case you need to have lavenia s statement that she was raped corroborated in any way i am telling you as a matter of law you don t as a matter of law it will only be on the rarest of occasions that a female victim s complaint of sexual violation will now require some form of corroboration so in short it is open for you to find this accused guilty on lavenia s evidence alone however in this case her evidence is supported by her husband s testimony of recent complaint and mr chand s own confession of guilt that may be significant for you 32 the reference to a recent court of appeal decision of course was a reference to the judgment of this court in seremaia balelala v the state criminal appeal no aau0003 of 2004s in that case this court held the rule requiring corroboration of the complainant s evidence in sexual cases was counter productive and discriminatory thereafter it became discretionary for the trial judge to give a warning or caution wherever there was some particular aspect of the evidence that gave rise to a question as to its reliability 33 thus it was in the judge s discretion as to whether he gave a warning or caution here the judge did not do so in our view it has not been demonstrated that he was wrong there was evidence from the complainant that the appellant held a glass louvre blade against her neck and forced her to have sexual intercourse the appellant was shown a louvre glass recovered from the scene by the police and he agreed that it was the glass he had used to threaten the complainant this is strong evidence from which if accepted that it could be reasonably be inferred that the complainant was in a state of submission the medical evidence disclosed that a complainant of rape might not show any sign of injury where she was frightened 34 we do not see any substance in this complaint and it therefore fails c d legal representation and preparation of defence 35 it is convenient to deal with these two grounds together they deal with the series of inter related complaints i not allowing time to seek representation ii proceeding with the trial without representation when the appellant had no knowledge of the law iii being in custody and unable to seek counsel iv being unrepresented due to financial constraints and v not giving the appellant the opportunity and facilities necessary to prepare a defence 36 for us to consider these complaints it is necessary to look at the history of the case from when the appellant was first charged until trial 37 the appellant first appeared in the magistrate s court on DATE when he indicated that he wished to seek legal advice he was in custody from then until DATE the appellant was committed to the high court for trial on DATE he sought legal aid on DATE he unsuccessfully sought bail so that he could prepare his case and obtain a lawyer on DATE he again applied for bail by then he had applied for legal aid he had been told that he could get aid if he pleaded guilty this advice was not accepted and he indicated that he intended to deny the charge although he still sought the assistance of a legal aid lawyer bail was again refused 38 by DATE disclosure had been completed and the appellant s request for legal aid had been unsuccessful a trial date was set for DATE the appellant then indicated that he would be able to get financial assistance from a brother in the united states to pay for counsel there were number of remands on account of this indication ultimately the court was told on DATE that the money had not materialized by then the trial date of DATE had been vacated 39 on DATE the appellant was granted bail on DATE with the trial now scheduled for DATE the appellant informed the court that he would be instructing a lawyer this was again confirmed on DATE then on DATE the new trial date the appellant failed to answer to his bail a bench warrant was issued and this remained outstanding until DATE when he appeared after he had been arrested on the bench warrant just over a month later on DATE the appellant informed the court that he elected to appear on his own behalf a new trial date was given for DATE the case to follow another specified case in fact the trial commenced on DATE 40 it is clear from this chronology that he was given every opportunity by the court to seek legal aid to seek funds for counsel and to seek counsel it does not escape our attention that the appellant had nearly eleven months during the time he absconded from his bail during which he could have engaged counsel 41 and as to his lack knowledge of the law to conduct his defence and the absence of representation at the trial we are unable to accept these complaints ahead of trial he made a number of bail applications and at the trial he cross examined state witnesses he challenged the admissibility of his caution and charge statements and he addressed the court in closing we therefore infer from the record that he did have a good understanding of the trial process in any event at the trial he elected to represent himself he did not seek an adjournment in order to brief counsel for these reasons we conclude that there is no substance in these various complaints and these grounds are accordingly rejected e the five months remand complaint 42 the appellant separately complains that he was remanded in custody for five months after he was recaptured and that in itself occasioned an unfair trial we see no substance in this complaint we have already dealt with the issue of representation and the opportunity to obtain counsel this grounds therefore fails conclusions on appeal against conviction 43 all the grounds of appeal against conviction have failed we consider that on the evidence the appellant was properly convicted there was ample evidence including the appellant s now unchallenged confessions to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of rape as charged the appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed appeal against sentence 44 the appellant complaints that the sentence of 10 years imprisonment was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances 45 at the time of sentencing the appellant was aged 41 years he had had a limited education to class 5 at primary school he was a joiner by trade and self employed doing some private jobs he was said to have a good work history he had previous convictions going back to 1985 including assaults occasioning actual bodily harm larceny and in 2003 a conviction and imprisonment for wrongful confinement for which he was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and a concurrent sentence of 3 months imprisonment for attempted rape that was his only previous conviction from an offence of a sexual nature the present offending was by the far the most serious to date 46 the judge reminded himself of the appropriate tariff for this kind of offending he referred to the decision of this court in mohammed kasim v the state appeal 14 of 1993 where this court observed we consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage 47 the judge took a starting point of 8 years he then identified the following aggravating factors a the abuse of trust by the appellant by tricking the complainant into believing that he the appellant could obtain employment for her when no such employment was available and this had been the means of luring her into his company b threats of violence by physically closing her mouth pulling her hair and putting the glass louvre blade to her neck 48 as well the judge took into account the appellants previous convictions including the conviction for attempted rape to which we have referred ultimately he concluded that a sentence of 10 years was the proper sentence in all the circumstances of the case 49 in our opinion such a sentence was appropriate for the circumstances of this crime a particularly serious feature of the case was the way that the appellant gained the confidence of the complainant by the deliberate deceit of the offer of a non existent job he then reduced her to a state of submission with acts of violence and the use of the glass louvre blade as a weapon as well there was the previous conviction for a attempted rape 50 the judge however fell into one error the appellant had been in custody on remand for a total period of just over 11 months the judge did not take this time into account the appellant was entitled to a credit we therefore propose to correct this error by reducing the sentence by one year 51 the appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 9 years is substituted result 52 1 the appeal against conviction is dismissed 2 the appeal against sentence is allowed 3 the sentence of 10 years is set aside and in lieu thereof a sentence of 9 years is substituted ellis ja penlington ja mcpherson ja solicitors

applicable as i still maintain my innocence viliame ravituba appeals against conviction and sentence on the following grounds 1 the five year sentence is not applicable as i maintain my innocence 2 the complainant did not appear at trial to testify and i did not cross examine her 3 the injuries as per the complainant s medical report were inflicted by her parents which is why neither she nor her parents appeared at trial to give evidence 4 the evidence relied on for conviction was unsafe 5 the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in imposing a sentence that was harsh and unconscionable the grounds of appeal as formulated by the court have been redrafted to avoid duplication and to make some sense of what the appellants were intending if the court has not properly interpreted their wishes it seeks their indulgence the first appellant s first ground of appeal and the second appellant s second ground of appeal are identical and will be considered together the complainant s evidence is set out at pages 23 and 24 of the court record she was cross examined by both the appellants at pages 25 and 27 of the court record miriama qelokai the complainant s mother gave evidence at page 27 of the court record the first appellant cross examined her at the same page while the second appellant chose not to do so there is therefore no merit in this ground of appeal because the court record speaks for itself the second ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the second appellant s third ground of appeal it is to the effect that the injuries the complainant suffered as per the medical report were inflicted by her parents the medical report is at pages 73 to 75 of the court record she had a wound on the left side of lower lip consistent with being hit by one of the appellants prior to the rape as she stated in evidence there was a moderate amount of milky fluid oozing out of her vagina consistent with sperm and there were pinpoint lacerations on the left upper part of the complainant s labia minorca and her hymen was not intact all these findings were consistent with her claim of non consensual sexual intercourse there is no merit in this ground of appeal the third ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the second appellants fourth ground of appeal they claim the evidence relied on was unsafe in their sworn evidence both admitted they had sexual intercourse with the complainant however they claim it was consensual apart from the act of penetration by the penis of the vagina there is also a mental element the appellant must have actual knowledge of the fact the woman was not consenting or was determined to have intercourse with her whether she was consenting or not ilaitia korociri v r criminal appeal no 43 of 1979 the complainant s testimony that the appellants had forced themselves on her despite her lack of consent is borne out by the injuries she sustained as recorded in her medical report her hymen had been ruptured she had injuries to her private parts and there was milky fluid seeping from her vagina the learned magistrate believed the complainant despite the lack of corroboration against which he warned himself there was also evidence of recent complaint as disclosed by the complainant to her mother and aunt and they in turn testified to her distressed state this ground must therefore fail the fourth ground of appeal of the first appellant is identical to the fifth ground of appeal of the second appellant they submit their five year prison sentence is harsh and unconscionable there is no merit in this ground of appeal the five year prison term meted out by the learned magistrate is the maximum sentence he can impose rape is a serious offence and carries a life imprisonment as a maximum sentence in the high court the offence of rape is viewed with the utmost seriousness because it reflects a proprietorial and demeaning attitude of women their lordships of the learned court of appeal have suggested a seven year term as a starting point for the offence of rape given those considerations this ground is denied the first appellant s fifth ground of appeal is identical to the second appellant s first ground of appeal they submit they are still innocent the appellants are entitled to due process they are innocent till proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt they have had hey day in court and the court is of opinion that the learned magistrate very properly convicted the appellants of the offence of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the penal code on the evidence before him this ground fails the appeal is accordingly dismissed and there is no basis for the appellants request for a retrial which is denied joni madraiwiwi puisne judge at labasa DATE

70164,judgment of the court introduction 1 the appellant was charged with defilement contrary to s 156 of the penal code in that he had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl then aged fourteen years and two months following a trial in the magistrates court he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment 2 he appealed to the high court against conviction and sentence in a judgment delivered by prakash j on DATE his appeal against conviction was dismissed his appeal against sentence was allowed the sentence of two and a half years being reduced to a sentence of eighteen months 3 the appellant has appealed against that judgment on the grounds that the judge erred by upholding the conviction in the magistrates court and by not reducing the sentence to a sentence less than eighteen months 4 this appeal is governed by s 22 of the court of appeal act cap 12 22 1 any party to an appeal from a magistrates court to the supreme court may appeal under this part against the decision of the supreme court in such appellate jurisdiction to the court of appeal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law only not including severity of sentence 5 mr shah accepted that under that section there was no right to appeal against sentence the appeal against sentence was abandoned facts 6 the facts can be shortly stated on DATE six persons including the appellant and the complainant drove to saweni beach when they arrived the others left the car the complainant remained in the backseat it was her evidence that the appellant came to her in the backseat and after some preliminary advances he had sexual intercourse with her 7 the evidence of the accused did not differ significantly from the evidence called by the prosecution except he says that he did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was in the car or otherwise that evening 8 the complainant said that after these events she washed herself in water and they drove back to marine drive she said she was ashamed to go home so she stayed with the church pastor and his wife shortly after the complaint was made to the police the decision in the magistrates court 9 in his decision the magistrate summarised the evidence of the complainant and the other witnesses for the prosecution in referring to the evidence of the appellant he said the accused admits the complainants story except he says that he did not have sexual intercourse in car he further stated that he thought the complainant was over 16 years old due to her size and built sic as his statutory defence i have also considered defence evidence but reject it as not true they confirm everything said by the prosecution witnesses except what implicates them in the crime the accused denied sexual intercourse at the beach however he turns around and says the size and built sic of the complainant showed she was over sixteen years old if he had no sex why would he talk of this statutory defence i also found this accused to blush and evade questions of prosecution on the relevant issues of sex he did not seem to be a truthful witness 10 he concluded that the complainants story was well corroborated by the witnesses in the case he found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt section 156 of the penal code cap 17 11 the issue in the high court and in this court centred on the proviso to subs 1 of s 156 of the penal code paragraph a of that subsection provides that a person is guilty of a misdemeanour who unlawfully and carnally knows any girl being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of sixteen years the proviso to the subsection provides provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under paragraph a if it shall be made to appear to the court before whom the charge shall be brought that the person so charged had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was of or above the age sixteen years the judgment in the high court 12 in his judgment on the appeal to the high court prakash j referred to the proviso to s 156 1 and to the relevant passages in the magistrates decision he held that it was clear that the magistrate did not shut out the statutory defence he found that the magistrate did not believe the appellant regarding evidence the appellant had given that he did not know about the complainant 13 the judge went on to say that it would have been ideal if the magistrate had specifically rejected the appellants belief in clear words in his judgment but that did not suggest that he did not address it and reject it prakash j concluded that there was no basis for disturbing the conviction the onus of proof 14 the first question of law that arose out of counsels submissions to this court was where there are circumstances that could give rise to the proviso applying on whom does the onus of proof rest 15 it was the case for the prosecution that in those circumstances it was for the person charged to make it appear to the court on the balance of probabilities that he had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age 16 it was the case for the appellant that in those circumstances the onus rested on the prosecution to prove on the balance of probabilities that the person charged did not have cause to believe and did not in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age 17 in support of his submission counsel for the appellant referred to the judgment of pathik j in nalasewa v the state crim app no 080 of 1999 where he had adopted the following passage from the judgment of grant cj in sat deo shiri wasto s o chandar deo and reginam crim app no 1 77 it is quite clear from this wording that an accused does not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the girl is of or above the age of sixteen it is only necessary for him to believe it on reasonable grounds moreover it is not incumbent upon an accused to satisfy the court beyond reasonable doubt that he had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was of or above the age of sixteen nor does he have to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities the use of the word defence in the proviso does not connote any shifting of the burden of proof the proviso refers to no more than an evidential burden so that for an accused to fall within the exception created by the proviso there need only be some evidence adduced either by the prosecution or by the defence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt 18 although he does not say so expressly we take the former chief justice to be holding in this passage that where there are circumstances that could make the proviso applicable the onus of proof rests on the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defence does not apply 19 the issue was considered by the court of criminal appeal in england in r v simmons 1931 23 cr app r 25 at that time the comparable proviso was of substantially the same effect as the proviso in s 156 1 it was in s 2 of the criminal law amendment act 1922 provided that in the case of a man of 23 years or under the presence of reasonable cause to believe that the girl was over the age of sixteen years shall be a valid defence on the first occasion on which he is charged with an offence under this section 20 the court of criminal appeal held at 27 with regard to carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen in order to make to good the defence set up of reason to believe the burden of proof rests upon the appellant 21 this same issue was considered by the court of appeal in new zealand in r v perry and pledger 1920 nzlr 21 at that time the comparable proviso was contained in s 208 2 of the crimes act 1908 it was again to the same effect as the proviso in s 156 1 it provided provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under this section if it is made to appear to the jury before whom the charge is brought that the accused was under the age of twenty one years at the date of the commission of the offence and had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or over the age of sixteen years 22 hosking j delivering the judgment of the court said at 23 there can be no doubt that the proviso to s 208 2 of the crimes act 1908 throws on the accused the burden of establishing the defence which the proviso allows that is the burden of making it appear to the jury that the accused had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or over the age of sixteen years this implies that the accused must also make it appear to the jury that he did in fact believe upon reasonable cause that the girl was of or over the age of 16 years such has always been the construction placed by our courts on this proviso 23 we see no reason why the proviso in s 156 1 of the penal code should not be applied in the same way as the comparable provisions have been applied in the united kingdom and in new zealand accordingly we answer the first question of law by holding that where there are circumstances that could give rise to the proviso applying the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was over sixteen years of age rests on the person charged the decision in the magistrates court 24 the second question of law advanced on behalf of the appellant was whether the magistrate in his decision had reached a decision on whether the appellant had established the defence in the proviso we doubt that this can correctly be considered a question of law only as required by the section but are prepared to answer it 25 is clear from the passages in his decision we have set out above that the magistrate had the defence in mind he found that the appellant was not truthful he was also aware of the apparent contradictions in the appellants evidence when he said that he did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant while at the same time attempting to invoke the defence in the proviso further he had the opportunity of observing the complainant in the witness box and forming his own view on whether there was reasonable cause for the appellant to believe that she was over the age of sixteen years she was fourteen years and two months well under sixteen in perry and pledger above the court of appeal held that the appearance of the complainant in the witness box was evidence to which the court in that case the jury can have regard in deciding whether there was reasonable cause for the belief 26 we agree with prakash j that it would have been preferable for the magistrate in his decision to have made an express finding on whether the appellant had discharged the onus of proof resting on him under the proviso but we have no doubt that the magistrate had reached the conclusion that the defence had not been established we answer the second question accordingly the result 27 the answers to the questions of law are in 23 and 26 as a consequence of those answers the appeal against the decision of the high court dismissing the appeal against

253957,judgment 1 on the DATE in the magistrates court at suva the respondent a serving police officer entered a plea of guilty to one count of assault causing actual bodily harm he admitted a summary of facts 2 on the DATE he was sentenced as follows no conviction recorded adjourned for 2 years bound over in the sum of 2000 for 2 years to be on good behavior commit no other offence in 2 years and if no offending and good behavior in 2 years you will be discharged pursuant to s 44 of sentencing and penalties decree 3 the state appeals that sentence on two grounds that the magistrate erred in law in not imposing a conviction on the grounds that the accused was a police officer when there was no evidence that a conviction would affect his occupation that the learned magistrate imposed a sentence that was below tariff for this type of offending and was manifestly lenient facts 4 the facts of the case were that on the DATE in the late afternoon the wife of the respondent confronted him asking why he had left their child unattended earlier that day a heated argument arose and the respondent assaulted his wife by throwing punches on to her face and the back of her head a medical examination revealed bruising and abrasion on the left side of the forehead the respondent admitted the assault when interviewed under caution he entered his plea of guilty at the first opportunity the sentence 5 the magistrate in her discretion rather than imposing an immediate penalty made use of section 44 of sentencing and penalties decree she has followed the provisions of the section almost completely analysis 6 in her attempt to treat this accused leniently the magistrate unfortunately fell into errors the provisions of s 44 of the sentencing penalties decree spd only come into play after conviction s 44 2 had she wanted to record no conviction then she could have used s 16 or s 43 d but then the question arises would this be an appropriate case to do so 7 a normal punishment for a domestic violence assault is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 9 and 12 months with an enhancement up to 18 months if the assault be considered serious a judicial officer can of course sentence outside that tariff if and only if he or she gives reasons for departing from the tariff 8 in a domestic violence context a sentencing tribunal must take into account the factors set out in section 4 3 of the spd unfortunately despite the word mustcontained in the section so many judicial officers dont in this case although she does not specifically say so the magistrate has considered the factors she should section 4 3 d is particularly relevant which states s 4 3 a court must have regard to d the effect of the offence in terms of hardship dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim in attempting to order no conviction and adjourn the matter with conditions the magistrate said after considering s 16 of spd this court takes into account that the offence is a minor one and that you have no previous convictions and that a conviction against you will affect your employment therefore no conviction is entered against you 9 whether punching your wifes head leaving bruises and abrasions is a minor offence or not is debateable the respondents counsel refers me to the case of kumar 2001 fjlr 225 where gates j as he then was was determining the fate of a police officer who had assaulted his wife gates j ruled that the accused be discharged without conviction saying upon the basis that a punishment if it were to result in the loss of the respondents livelihood with the police would be disproportionate to the crime committed this case runs counter however to the same judges decision in batiratu har 001 2012 where the chief justice distinguished the kumar case and said absolute discharges are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances such as where no moral blame detaches where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty 10 there can be no doubt that this case is not a technical breach nor one where no moral blame attaches in these days where domestic violence is very much in the forefront of the public consciousness police officers who are tasked to uphold the law must be also seen to stay within the law 11 an appellate court would upset the exercise of judicial discretion in a court below very rarely however in balancing here the competing interests of the state and the accused it has to be determined that the strict provisions of the domestic violence decree must flow on to a policeman charged with assaulting his police woman wife there is no evidence before the court either below or here that would say that his future in the force would be affected but in any event that is a factor that he should have considered before launching a physical attack on his wife who had extended to him very little if any provocation 12 since batiratu supra it is now a well entrenched truth in our criminal law that nobody is above the law the chief justice there and this court here give a loud voice of application of human dignity equality and freedom as enshrined in section 3 1 of the constitution 2013 13 there is no reason why there should be no conviction recorded in the present case the magistrates order to the contrary is quashed and it is ordered that a conviction be recorded 14 punches around the head are potentially dangerous and in this case an enormous overreaction to a dispute over babysitting the accused having been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm must be punished for that crime 15 given that the hypothetical plumber from raiwaqa would receive a sentence of at least 9 months depending on his mitigation i would attach a high degree of leniency to this accuseds sentence taking him out of the tariff for the offence 16 on any review where a lenient sentence is to be replaced by a harsher penalty that harsher sentence should be alleviated to compensate for the accuseds reasonable expectation that his case had been dealt with and determined presumably to his satisfaction 17 in addition the accused had strong mitigation features available to him in that he had entered a plea of guilty to the offence he was a first offender he had reconciled with his wife and he was relatively young 18 pursuant to section 256 2 of the criminal procedure decree 2009 i quash the adjournment orders made in the court below and would substitute a sentence of 4 months imprisonment 19 i confirm the magistrates domestic violence restraining order imposed on the accused as perpetrator and the wife and child as protected persons which will remain in force until further orders 20 this is a sentence passed in

harm to karalaini likubua unlawfully wounded the said karalaini likubua with a kitchen knife 1 following his plea a set of relevant facts were put to him facts which he admitted he was convicted of the charge 2 the facts admitted are that the accused is aged 31 and employed as a transport assistant on the day in question at lami he stabbed his sister in law over a dispute about repayment of a 20 loan 3 on the DATE the victim had been in the kitchen after her husband had left for work the accused was still in the house lying on the sofa in the sitting room the victims daughter was also in the sitting room the victim came into the sitting room to ask her daughter to go with her to lami town the accused asked the victim about the sum of 20 that she owed him the victim did not reply to which the accused said qaraunaiko which means watch out 4 the victim went to her room to bath and the accused followed her and stabbed her on the back of the head with a kitchen knife the victim fell to the floor and blood poured out of her head she was unable to move her hands or legs 5 a medical examination revealed that she had a 3cm deep laceration at the right lateral posterior neck she was hospitalised for 5 days 6 the accused co operated with the police and admitted the offence in his interview under caution mitigation 1 counsel for the accused tells me that the accused is 32 married with a 5 year old daughter and had worked for a large transport company asa drivers assistant for 120 per week 2 at the time of the offence the accused had asked for his money back that he had lent the victim but she appeared not to take his request seriously he was frustrated took the knife and acted without thought of the consequences 3 he has no previous convictions with a young family 4 he co operated with the police and admitted the offence in his caution interview 5 he is said to be remorseful and has apologized to the victim his sister in law this has been confirmed by a letter she has written to the court saying that she did not want to pursue the matter any further 6 it is submitted that it was an opportunistic crime and not pre meditated he had a sudden surge of anger and acted without thought 7 he has pleaded guilty to the crime which has saved the costs of trial and saved the time of the court the law 1 the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment various cases but in particular mabamokubula haa0052of 2003 have held that the tariff for the offence must be from 2 years to 5 years imprisonment and more in a domestic violence context 16 in the mokubula case shameem j analysed several cases from the high court and the court of appeal and concluded that in an attack by a weapon the starting point should range between 2 years and 5 years depending on the weapon used she added that a suspended sentence in not appropriate 17 although shameem j was considering an appeal of sentence for the identical offence under the penal code the new offence under the crimes decree has the same maximum penalty and this court does now confirm that the tariff is a term of immediate imprisonment from 2 to 5 years and the nature and danger of the weapon used along with the injuries inflicted will be the determinants of where in that range the starting point is taken 18 it is to be remembered that reconciliation in a domestic violence offence is hardly ever genuine and it should be only in extremely special circumstances that this offence when it is domestic violence would attract a suspended sentence in fact sentences for serious cases of acts with intent in domestic violence can attract sentences well in excess of this tariff laid down here see for example emositakutuigulagula 2011 hac 81 of 2010 ltk discussion 19 first and foremost this offence is an offence of domestic violence although the victim has written to the court asking that proceedings be stayed this cannot be done in a domestic violence case all too often family members are manipulated for one reason or another not to pursue a case against a relative perpetrators however must take responsibility for attacks within a family home and all persons women especially must be able to live in their own homes without fear of assault or attack 20 section 4 3 of the sentencing and penalties decree spd provides special sentencing considerations for an offence of domestic violence which i must consider it is an aggravating feature in terms of section 4 3 b that there was a child presentwhen the attack occurred and there is the mitigating factor that the accused has taken proven positive steps to accept responsibility for his behavior 21 the offence is serious in that it was an attack by means of a knife an inherently dangerous weapon on a person in the region of the head and neck any attack to the head or spinal area must be viewed with the utmost severity because that is an area that is one of the most vulnerable in the body 22 it is of course to the accuseds credit that he has co operated pleaded guilty and reconciled with his sister in law he is young and has a clear record 23 although the accused pleads provocation the provocation alleged is very minimal for the victim to ignore a request to repay his 20 dollars certainly didnt deserve an attack to the head with a kitchen knife 24 i take a starting point for this offence a term of 4 years imprisonment this high starting point subsumes the serious domestic violence attack for his clear record and relative youth i deduct one year and for his plea of guilty a further year 25 the accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years he will serve a term of 18 months before he is eligible to be released on parole 26 there is a domestic violence restraining order in

269925,judgment calanchini p 1 i have read the judgment of chandra ja and agree that the appeal should be allowed and the sentence varied as proposed in his judgment chandra ja 2 the appellant was charged with one count of rape contrary to sections 207 1 and section 207 2 of the crimes decree 2009 3 the facts admitted by the appellant were that he was staying with the victims family he being related to the victims father the mother had left the house to visit the father in hospital and left the victim who was 9 years old and her elder brother in the care of the appellant after dinner the two children had gone to sleep on a mattress the boy had asked the appellant to sleep on the mattress with them as their mother had not returned the appellant had blown out the candle and joined them on the mattress the boy had told the victim to lie in the middle between him and the appellant while lying down the appellant had pulled down the victims panties and used his fingers to indecently invade her the victim had felt pain and tried to push his hand away but the appellant had persisted the next morning the victim had told her mother about the incident and the appellant had been chased away and the police had been informed 4 at the trial the appellant had pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 9 years 5 the appellant appealed against his sentence and was granted leave the grounds of appeal relied on according to the written submissions filed were the following the learned high court judge erred in fact and law when he failed to deduct the time the appellant spent in remand the learned trial judge erred in fact and law when he failed to justify the imposition of a non parole period considering the circumstances of the appellant 6 counsel for the appellant at the hearing of the appeal sought leave to pursue a further ground of appeal that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive as the starting point taken in sentencing the appellant was high which resulted in the sentence that was finally imposed 7 counsel for the appellant submitted that he was not pursuing the 2nd ground of appeal but pursued with the first ground of appeal and the ground of appeal set out orally at the argument stage for which he sought leave 8 the court allowed the appellant to pursue the added ground of appeal and both parties made oral submissions regarding same consideration of the grounds of appeal 9 the first ground of appeal was as regards the failure of the learned high court judge to take into account the period that the appellant was in remand when imposing the sentence 10 the facts set out in the record of the high court were not very clear as to the exact period of remand but however both counsel agreed that the period of remand was about 3 months and counsel for the respondent conceded that the said period had not been taken into account when the sentence was imposed 11 the law relating to this position of taking into account the period in remand when imposing a sentence has been clearly laid down in several decisions of the court of appeal 12 section 24 of the sentences and penalties decree 2009 provides if an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall unless a court considers otherwise orders be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender 13 in kean v the state 2013 fjca 14 aau0018 of 20 DATE it was decided by the court of appeal that as a matter of sentencing principle the sentencing court should make a downward adjustment to the sentence for a period that the accused spent in custody on remand before sentence accordingly a period of 5 months was deducted being the period spent in remand before trial 14 in naivalurua koroitavalena v state 2014 fjca 185 aau0051 of 20 DATE it was stated referring to section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 20 this section mandates the trial judge to deduct the period that an accused is held in custody prior to the trial when imposing a sentence however if the trial judge is of the view that such period should be so deducted he should give reasons for not doing so 15 in the present case the learned high court judge had not deducted the period that the appellant had been in remand which as stated above was three months nor had he given reasons for not doing so 16 therefore the appellant is entitled to a deduction of three months from the period of imprisonment imposed on him 17 the appellant was not pursuing the second ground of appeal however it would be relevant to state the position set out regarding the imposition of the non parole period relating to section18 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 in the case of savu v state 2014 fjca 208 aau0090 of 20 DATE to the following effect section 18 subsection 1 has to be read subject to sub section 2 the effect of thee two provisions is that an offender who is imprisoned for 2 years or more must be subject to a non parole period unless due to the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender fixing a non parole period is inappropriate in other words fixing a non parole period for a term of 2 years or more is mandatory unless for the limited reasons provided by subsection 2 the court declines to fix one it therefore follows that when the court fixed a non parole period under sub section 1 the court is not required to give reasons for its decision because the provision is mandatory however if the court declines to fix a non parole period then the court must give reasons for exercising the discretion under subsection 2 18 the new ground of appeal which the court allowed to pursue when counsel sought leave when arguing the case for the appellant was as regards the harshness of the sentence on the basis of the higher starting point adopted by the learned high court judge in sentencing the appellant 19 the following observations were made by the court of appeal in drotini v the state 2006 fjca 26 aau0001 of 2005s DATE regarding sentencing in cases of rape specially involving child victims by relatives 16 there are few more serious aggravating circumstances than where the rape is committed on a juvenile girl by a family member or someone who is in a position of special trust the seriousness of the offence is exaggerated by the fact that family loyalties and emotions all too often enable the offender or other family members to prevent a complaint going outside the family if the child then remains in the family home the rapist often has the opportunity to repeat the offence and to hope for the same protection from the rest of the family 17 cases of rape by fathers or step fathers appear before the courts in fiji far too frequently and in such cases the starting point should be increased to ten years where there are further aggravating circumstances beyond those basic circumstances such as repeated sexual molestation of any nature threats of violence or actual violence or evidence that the offender has attempted to persuade other family members to help cover up the offences or discourage complaint to the police there should be substantial increases above that starting point 20 the victim in drotinis case was 9 or 10 years old and was the step daughter of the accused and was convicted of one count of indecent assault and two counts of rape the starting point for sentencing was ten years and the final sentence was 11 years imprisonment 21 in anand abhay raj v the state 2014 fjsc 12 cav0003 of 2014 DATE the supreme court affirmed the sentence of 16 years imprisonment where the accused who was the step father was convicted of raping a child who was 10 years old there being four counts of rape and one count of indecent assault the starting point of the sentencing by the high court judge was 12 years which ultimately was made up to 16 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 years 22 drotinis case and rajs case were cases where there was penile rape of the young victims on more than one occasion whereas in the present case the rape was not a penile rape but one when the appellant had used his fingers to abuse the victim this was the only occasion regarding which the appellant was charged with that however does not take away the trust reposed on him when the victim was placed in his care by her mother 23 in the present case the learned high court judge commenced sentencing at a starting point of 14 years whereas in drotinis case the starting point was 10 years and in rajs case the starting point was 12 years which were cases where there were penile rapes on more than one occasion in those circumstances the starting point of 14 years adopted by the learned high court judge in this case is too high it would have been appropriate if the starting point was 12 years and adopting the methodology adopted by the learned high court judge the aggravating circumstances would increase the term to 14 years the deductions allowed were 2 years for demonstrable remorse and religious mitigation and a further 3 years for the guilty plea which would result in the final term being 9 years the three months that he spent in remand would be deducted resulting in the term being 8 years and 9 months 24 this would be a fit case to interfere with the sentence that was imposed on the appellant the sentence of 11 years imposed on the appellant is quashed and substituted with a sentence of 8 years and 9 months from DATE with a non parole period of 7 years and six months jayasuriya ja 25 i had the opportunity to read the draft judgment of chandra ja i agree with chandra jas decision to allow the appeal and vary the sentence for the reasons stated therein orders of court the appeal of the appellant is allowed to the extent that the sentence of 11 years

250848,sentence 1 on the 14th april the accused entered an unequivocal plea to a count of rape of a 7 year old girl in naweni in this northern division on the DATE 2 he agreed an appropriate set of facts upon which he was convicted facts 3 the facts reveal that in the evening of the date in question the accused had been drinking with others and he returned to a tent where he usually slept the victim aged 7 at the time was sleeping alone in the tent when he returned the child s mother usually slept in the tent but on this occasion she was at a house nearby drinking kava there was just the accused and the young girl alone in the tent 4 the accused moved close to the girl and removed her panty he used his finger to invade her whilst at the same time he was pleasuring himself he continued to use his finger on the girl until feeling sudden pain in her vagina she awoke crying just at that moment the mother came back and saw the activity the child told the mother what the accused had done to her 5 the accused confessed to a church elder that evening and when interviewed by the police he freely admitted his transgression the accused 6 the accused was born on the DATE meaning that at the time of the offence he was only two months from being a juvenile 7 at the time he was living with his mother in a village where he did some subsistence farming he also worked as a labourer on a school construction site where he earned a small amount of money 8 he had at the end of 2016 dropped out of school because of the financial pressures on his family 9 he has a clear record making him a first offender the law 10 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the tariff for rapes of children is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 10 and 16 years anand abhay raj cav003 of 2014 11 meaningful discounts must be afforded to the accused for his youth his clear record and his co operation with the authorities his plea of guilty before this court will also be recognized a plea that has saved the court s time and more importantly has saved the very young child having to relive this trauma and give evidence of a sexual nature this sentence 12 the court is very conscious of the extreme youth of this accused only two months earlier he passed from being a juvenile to becoming an adult in law however at 18 he is still a child and children do impetuous things without realizing the consequences of their actions 13 as this court said very recently in fabiano hac14 0f 2016 the courts have always been at pains to treat young offenders with mercy and to keep them from the baneful and corrupting influences of an adult prison community such good intentions however must be balanced with the seriousness of the offence he or she is convicted of 14 the rape of a child is a serious crime indeed especially a child of 7 years old at that age she knows what is happening and the literature tells us that the trauma of such an event can have very serious repercussions indeed on her mental and sexual development 15 it is my judicial duty to take a starting point in the range set down by the supreme court that is within the range of 10 to 16 years i take a starting point of 10 years imprisonment 16 there is aggravation of the offence in that there has been a breach of trust the mother allowing the accused to sleep in the tent with her and her daughter trusts that the accused will molest neither her nor the child and the accused has breached that trust i add 2 years to the sentence to reflect that breach 17 despite the heinous abuse the accused has a good deal of mitigation to his credit he is very remorseful and he has co operated with the authorities from the outset he has a hitherto clear record and he has spent over 2 months in remand awaiting these proceedings for this considerable mitigation i deduct 2 years from his sentence bringing it back to ten years 18 his very early guilty plea has saved the child and her mother from reliving this ordeal and has saved court time for that plea i deduct a further two years from the sentence making a total sentence of 8 years that is the sentence that this court passes on the accused 19 it is inevitable and regrettable that because of the seriousness of his abuse that he will have to spend years of his progress to full maturity in the company of hardened convicts but he must be given the opportunity of redemption and a chance to be once again a useful member of his rural community 20 it is for that reason that this sentence in one that outside the tariff and it must in no way be used to distort the tariff already laid down by the supreme court in anand abhay raj supra 21 it is also for that reason that i decline to set a minimum term that he serve before being eligible for parole conclusion

two days in this court during which the victim you and your wife gave evidence 3 at the conclusion of the trial this court having considered the unanimous verdict of guilty returned by the assessors on both these counts and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial decided to accept the opinion of the assessors in respect of the charges and found you guilty and convicted of the said charges 4 the following facts were proven in evidence during the trial i the victim in this case was 18 years old at the time of the incident you are her step father and married to her mother for 10 years you have inserted your fingers into the vagina of lanieta adimaibure when she was sleeping on her bed in the morning hours of DATE ii in addition on a subsequent date you have kissed her mouth and put your tongue into her mouth on another day you have watched lanieta adimaibure using washroom 5 according to section the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 the maximum punishment for rape is imprisonment for life it is a serious offence 6 the tariff for rape of an adult is well settled since the judgment of hon mr justice a h c t gates as he was then in state v marawa 2004 fjhc 338 hac 0016t 2003s DATE the starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years the tariff is 7 years to 15 years i have also considered the judgment of the supreme court in anand abhay raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 where it had dealt with similar factual situation 7 in mohamed kasim v the state unreported fiji court of appeal cr case no 14 of 1993 DATE the court of appeal observed thus we consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 8 the offence of indecent assault attracts a punishment of five years as per section 212 1 of the crimes decree 9 i have followed the guidelines laid down by justice shameem in rokota v state 2002 fjhc168 in determining the tariff for indecent assault count against you 10 as already noted by this court in the preceding paragraphs you have in committing indecent assault on your step daughter put your tongue into her mouth in addition you watched her using washroom 11 however the court noted that even though there is bodily contact between you and your step daughter there was no use of genitalia in the commission of offence as per the judgment of state v laca 2012 fjhc 1414 where hon justice p madigan referring to the united kingdoms legal guidelines for sentencing categorized sexual assault into following 3 categories category 1 the most serious contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim category 2 i contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victims body ii contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia or an object iii contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim category 3 contact between parts of the offenders body other than the genitalia with part of the victims body other than the genitalia 12 therefore your act of indecent assault on you step daughter is identified as an instance satisfying category 3 13 considering the above circumstances i commence your sentence at 9 years imprisonment for the charge of rape 14 the aggravating factors are i serious breach of trust by the victim towards you being her step father ii victim is relatively of young age iii your lack of remorse by letting the victim relive her experience in court v you took advantage of the victims vulnerability vi you displayed total disregard of the victims safety and wellbeing vii you have instilled insecurity in the minds of other children with your illegal actions 15 i add 4 years for above aggravating factors now your sentence is 13 years 16 the mitigating factors are i you are a first offender as conceded by the state the three previous convictions are over 10 years and are disputed by the accused ii you are a 44 year old subsistence farmer and sole breadwinner ii you are married with four step children iii your wife is having a physical illness iv you have provided for your step children for over the past 8 years v you have provided for the education of the victim vi you have committed rape by insertion of your fingers and not by your penis vii one incident and no repetition 17 i deduct 3 years for the above mitigating factors now the sentence is 10 years 18 in respect of the count of indecent assault i impose a 3 year sentence of imprisonment 19 you were in remand for this case for a period of one week and were on bail thereafter and throughout the continuation of trial the judgment of bavoro v state 2013 fjhc 1 recognised that an appropriate reduction in the sentence to reflect the appellants remand period could be made under section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree no 42 of 2009 considering the duration of the period you spent in remand i do not make order of any

70803,sentence 1 albertino shankar and francis narayan you have been found guilty by the court of the offence of murder the sentence fixed by law for such an offence is that the convicted person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life there is no discretion allowed to the court in a murder case to sentence to a lesser term 2 it is well known that convicted persons sentenced to life imprisonment usually do not serve the full term that is serve imprisonment for the rest of their lives most have their sentences reduced after serving a considerable term such as 10 or 12 years 3 in this case i had called for submissions from counsel on whether i should recommend a minimum period to be served under the provisions of section 33 of the penal code 4 ms narayan submitting for both prisoners informs me that the actual period of imprisonment is usually 14 years but that the latter part is allowed to be served in the community outside of the prison walls 5 it is significant here that the prisoners were very young when they committed this offence albertino was aged 17 years 9 months he is now 20 francis was aged 21 at the time and he is now 23 i keep in mind their youth 6 they are not from well off homes they did not get far with their education albertino appears to have drifted between a home with his single mother and a home with his elderly grandfather francis home appears more stable yet he got involved in an offence of bulk store breaking in 1999 and served a term of imprisonment of 9 months albertino has not previously been before the courts 7 both have had casual work but nothing of permanence or promise 8 neither has shown any remorse for what they have done both maintain their innocence but both were emotionally moved when asked if they had anything to say prior to sentence and in addressing the court 9 mr rabuku has made no submissions on behalf of the state on the question of whether there should be a recommendation of minimum service ms narayan says the recommendation should be of 5 years only since they have been on remand now for 2 years 3 months equivalent to a full term of 3 years 9 months 10 i take that period of remand into account when arriving at the appropriate order 11 this was as i said in summing up the case a truly dreadful crime a 34 year old chinese lady a ms tang living alone in a flat awakens to find two men entering through her bedroom window after midnight 12 according to the accused their plan was to steal from ms tang they did eventually do just that and this might have remained a case of house breaking but the two accused commencing with albertino then raped ms tang francis followed after and raped her also each accused raped her for a second time whilst they remained in the flat they are not charged with rape but i take what they said they did into account as an aggravating feature of this murder case 13 but to avoid any struggling and any chance of ms tang shouting out for help before each raped her a second time they taped her ankles with scotch tape or masking tape and bound up most of her face with tape and tied her hands behind her back with wire 14 all of this account comes from the prisoners own admissions made to the police the accused then discussed in front of ms tang what they were going to do with her though there was some initial reluctance on the part of francis both agreed eventually that she would have to be killed because she would recognise them again it is likely she knew albertino as a person who lived downstairs at the same block of flats 15 albertino brought a piece of rope from another room wound it several times around the victim s neck and strangled her francis held her legs she struggled until she ceased breathing and died 16 just prior to the strangling no doubt realising what the 2 accused were deciding to do with her ms tang kept pleading with them i don t want to die i don t want to die it is not difficult to imagine the horrific ordeal that faced the victim in her final moments 17 her life was taken with hardly a thought ruthlessly callously 18 the defence at one point appeared to hint at responsibility for the crime lying with one of ms tang s friends 19 the inhabitants of fiji must be made to feel secure in their homes they should be able to sleep easily to feel secure housebreakers are to be deterred or at least punished housebreakers who go on to commit rape on the occupants need even more severe punishment to those who having committed those two serious crimes go on to destroy the evidence and to murder the occupants can expect no mercy from the courts the courts have a duty to inflict condign punishment 20 but i have arrived at a recommendation for a minimum term to be served that will not destroy your lives it will allow some hope for a fresh start when you are released it is to be hoped that when that time comes you will indeed be able to start afresh and to make something of your lives 21

260103,sentence ___________________________________________________________________________ 1 serupepeli bolalailai after being convicted on count of sexual assault rape and attempted rape and contrary to sections 210 1 a 3 a 207 1 2 b 3 and 208 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 you are now brought before this court for imposition of your sentence 2 you pleaded guilty to the charge of sexual assault and was duly convicted for that charge you then pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges of rape and attempted rape in the information the ensuing trial proper lasted for four days in this court during which the complainant noela rakawati dr ilisapeci vereti and the two police officers who were involved with the recording your caution interview statement have given evidence for the prosecution while you also offered evidence 3 at the conclusion of trial having reviewed the evidence and its summing up to assessors this court decided to accept their unanimous opinion and found you guilty and convicted you to the count of rape and attempted rape 4 the following facts were proved during the trial i the 7 year old complainant was a student at st vincent primary and on DATE you after calling her into your room by giving her a 2 dollar coin tried to insert your penis into her vagina and then inserted two fingers into it ii when noela came to see you she saw you were with the complainant and she was naked from her waist noela then alerted her mother and upon questioning the complainant revealed what you did the matter was then reported to police iii on the same day the complainant was medically examined at the time of examination dried blood clots were noted in her groin and her left labia minor had a small abrasion 5 according to section 207 1 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 the maximum punishment for rape is imprisonment for life it is a serious offence 6 the complainant was 7 of age at the time of the rape and therefore is a child the tariff for rape of a child is confirmed in the judgment of chief justice gates in raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 the starting point of imprisonment for rape of a child is 10 years the tariff is between 10 years to 16 years 7 in mohammed kasim v the state unreported cr case no 14 of 1993 of DATE the court of appeal observed thus it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage 8 in determining the starting point within the said tariff goundar j in koroivuki v state 2013 fjca 15 has formulated the following guiding principles in selecting a starting point the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence no reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time as a matter of good practice the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors the final term should fall within the tariff if the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range 9 the sentence for attempted rape is 10 years of imprisonment and the tariff is set at 1 to 5 years in aunima v state 2001 fjhc 105 10 the sentence for sexual assault is 10 years and its tariff is set at 2 8 years imprisonment as per state v abdul kaiyum hac 160 of 2010 and state v laca 2012 fjca 1414 11 considering the nature of offending and in the light of the above guiding principles i commence your sentence at 12 years of imprisonment for the count of rape 12 the aggravating factors are i breach of trust the victim had towards you ii opportunistic planning iii taking advantage of the victims vulnerability iv display of total disregard to the victims wellbeing v the 46 years of age gap between you and the complainant 13 i add 2 years and 8 months on your sentence for above aggravating factors now your sentence is 14 years and 8 months 14 the mitigating factors are i you are a first offender ii you co operated with the police during investigations 15 i deduct 1 year from your sentence for rape on the above mitigating factors now the sentence is 13 years and 8 months 16 you were in remand for this case for a period of 6 months and 20 days and after conviction another 17 days pending sentencing i consider it as a total period of 8 months 17 in view of the provisions contained in section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 i deduct your 8 month long remand period from your sentence and now the sentence to serve is 13 years 18 you pleaded guilty to the count of sexual assault on the first available opportunity on that charge sentence of 6 years is initially imposed but is reduced to 4 years of imprisonment in view of early guilty plea in considering the aggravating and mitigatory grounds a further 6 months is reduced from your sentence on this charge your final term of imprisonment on sexual assault is therefore 3 years and 6 months 19 in relation to attempted rape you are sentenced to a 3 year term of imprisonment after aggravating and mitigating grounds are considered 20 considering section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree i impose 10 years and 4 months of non parole period as per the judgment of supreme court in tora v the state 2015 fjsc 23 summary 21 your final sentence is therefore as follows i for the count of rape 13 years of imprisonment with a non parole period fixed at 10 years and 4 months ii for the count of sexual assault 3 years and 6 months of imprisonment iii for the count of attempted rape 3 years of imprisonment 22 the terms of imprisonments imposed in relation to charges of sexual assault

78873,ruling 1 this is an application for leave to appeal against sentence pursuant to section 21 1 c of the court of appeal act 2 the appellant was convicted and sentenced to total term of 10 years imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault and one count of rape in the high court at suva the victims were three young boys aged 7 8 and 11 years they lived in the same neighbourhood as the appellant the facts were that the appellant invited the victims to his house and after committing the alleged sexual assaults gave them a small token of money to keep them quiet the sexual acts included kissing the victims and lying on top of them the rape victim was the youngest after penetrating the victims mouth with his penis the appellant performed oral sex on the victim 3 on each count of sexual assault the learned judge imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment after citing the tariff to be between 2 to 4 years imprisonment as established by rokota v state criminal appeal no haa0068 of 2002 the learned judge did not refer to any specific range of sentences for rape of a child but used 12 years imprisonment as a starting point after citing three high court cases that were considered under the repealed penal code the learned judge added two years after identifying the following aggravating factors at paragraph 27 of his sentencing remarks i age of the victims ranging from 7 years to 11 years ii you have repeated your sexual activities on 5 children i take the reference to 5 children is a typographical error as the facts adopted by the learned trial judge correctly identified 3 victims 4 the sentence was then reduced by four years for the following mitigating factors at paragraph 28 of the sentencing remarks i you were 29 years unmarried ii you are remorseful iii you have pleaded guilty iv your period in remand v you were subjected to abuse when you were a small child 5 the learned judge then imposed a sentence of 10 years for rape and 4 years for each count of sexual assault to be served concurrently the total sentence was 10 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 8 years 6 the grounds of appeal against sentence are 1 the learned judge erred in fact and in law when he failed to take into account the period that the appellant was in remand before sentence and failed to award an appropriate discount or deduction for such time already spent in remand 2 the learned judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a separate discount to the appellant for his guilty plea 3 the learned judge erred in law and fact when he took the starting point of 12 years for sentence as he should have started at the lower end of the scale given the circumstances of the case 4 the learned judge erred in fact and law when he failed to properly take into account the mitigating factors provided by the appellant 7 the test for leave to appeal against sentence is that the appellant must demonstrate the sentencing judge has arguably acted upon a wrong principle mistook the facts failed to take into account some relevant considerations or took into account irrelevant matters in sentencing ground 1 remand period 8 remand period was subsumed in the deduction made for the mitigating factors the remand period was one month since the length of the remand period was not substantial no arguable error can arise from the manner in which the learned judge deducted the remand period by subsuming it under the mitigating factors this ground is not arguable ground 2 guilty plea 9 there is no hard and fast rule regarding the weight to be given to a guilty plea generally a generous discount is given for guilty pleas in rape cases because the victims are relieved from giving evidence in court that is of sexual nature timing of the guilty plea is also relevant in assessing the weight to be given to the guilty plea counsel for the appellant cites the case of naikelekelevesi v state criminal appeal no aau0001 of 2007 for the proposition that a guilty plea should be discounted separately from the mitigating factors naikelekelevesis case was considered before the sentencing and penalties decree came into effect in 2010 the sentencing and penalties decree has not endorsed the naikelekelevesi principle instead the sentencing and penalties decree has left it to the discretion of the sentencing court to give an appropriate weight to a guilty plea when sentencing an offender in the present case the appellant was given a generous discount of 4 years for all the mitigating factors including his guilty pleas 10 a separate discount for the guilty pleas may not have resulted in the same reduction that was given for the mitigating factors initially the appellant pleaded guilty but then withdrew his guilty pleas he changed his pleas to guilty only after he was found to be mentally stable at the time of the offending by a psychiatrist in my judgment the guilty pleas by the appellant were not evidence of contrition but an acknowledgement of the strength of evidence against him on charges that could have attracted harsher sentences than what was imposed on him after he pleaded guilty this ground is not arguable ground 3 starting point 11 as a matter of practice the starting point is selected from an objective seriousness of the offence or offences without consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors there is no fixed rule regarding the selection of a starting point the main principle is that the final sentence should reflect the criminality involved in the present case the learned judge used a head starting point of 12 years for both rape and sexual assaults and then made all the sentences concurrent the effect of this approach is that the appellant received one punishment for four separate sexual offences against three victims ten years imprisonment clearly reflects the criminality involved this ground is not arguable ground 4 co operation with police and previous good character 12 under this ground the appellant submits that the learned high court judge failed to take into account the appellants co operation with police and previous good character as a matter of principle co operation and assistance rendered by an accused to police in the course of a criminal investigation that leads to an arrest and prosecution of other suspects attract some discount in sentence for the accused who offered the relevant information in this case there was no evidence that the appellant assisted police investigation under caution the appellant denied the allegations denial of allegations is not tantamount to co operation 13 however the appellant was a first time offender counsel appearing for the appellant in the high court informed the learned judge that the appellant was a first time offender in sentencing the appellant the learned judge failed to take into account that the appellant was a first time offender previous good character no doubt is a mitigating factor and the appellant was entitled to some reduction in sentence for that fact this ground is arguable result 14 leave granted on the failure of the trial judge to take into account the appellants previous good character in sentence under ground 4 leave refused on the remaining grounds hon justice d goundar justice of appeal paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,0,1267

278015,judgment sentences for domestic violence wounding on the DATE in the magistrates court at nasinu the appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of unlawful wounding contrary to section 261 of the crimes decree 2009 she was sentenced by the resident magistrate on the DATE to a term of imprisonment of 18 months and a domestic violence restraining order was issued against her in favour of her husband as the protected person the facts upon which she was convicted were that the appellant lived with the complainant who is a police officer and they had two young children on the DATE while both were watching tv an argument arose as to where the husband had spent the previous friday night away from home the argument became heated until this appellant threw a kitchen knife at her husbands stomach in an attempt to ward off the knife his middle right finger was wounded resulting in profuse bleeding on agreement to these facts the appellant as accused at trial was convicted in his sentence the learned magistrate found that the aggravating features of the crime were 1 minimal provocation 2 degree of violence high 3 use of knife to inflict injury 4 abuse of trust 5 intention to commit more serious injury 6 attack to stomach very vulnerable and the mitigating features he found to be plea of guilty remorse apologized to court co operation with the police first offender reconciliation no premeditation personal circumstances mother of two young children the maximum sentence for this offence is 5 years imprisonment there are as yet no guidelines set but in suresh nand maharaj haa 48 of 2010 goundar j upheld an 18 month sentence for a similar offence the learned magistrate took 24 months imprisonment as a starting point he added 10 months for the aggravating factors and reduced it by 6 months for the mitigating factors and by a further 10 months for a plea of guilty and the reconciliation resulting in a final sentence of 18 months imprisonment the magistrate spent much research and time in reviewing authorities to decide whether to suspend the sentence or not he decided after much deliberation not to suspend the sentence because it was gratuitous and unnecessary violence in a domestic violence context pursuant to section 24 of the domestic violence decree the magistrate made the compulsory domestic violence restraining order to protect the safety of her husband this appeal the appellant by his counsel submits that she was penalized twice by the magistrate who had found that the degree of violence was high and that a wound resulted but then went on to find the high violence to be an aggravating factor as a second ground she submits that her crime was of a lesser nature than that penalized in the case of suresh nand maharaj v state haa 48 1010 where a sentence of 18 months was approved she says her lesser crime should have attracted a lesser sentence as a third ground the appellant relies on cases of act with intent to cause serious bodily harm which is a more serious crime and where lesser sentences have been imposed in particular she relies on john trail hac 181 11 where the accused was sentenced to one year suspended for two years for act to cause grievous bodily harm it was a case of punching and hitting the victim with a piece of timber bringing blood to the head and causing fracture to the base of the skull the appellants last ground is that the sentence is severe given that no disability nor permanent injury resulted the appellants counsel is correct in saying that there has not been a tariff set for this offence but it was said by this court in kolinio sikitora hac 67 2010ltk that a tariff of 9 12 months imprisonment would be appropriate for the offence given that that was the penal code tariff and the maximum penalty has not charged however as was said in that case and it is repeated now that sentences for wounding in domestic violence cases must attract higher sentences because of the breach of trust sentences for this offence when the wounding is serious could extend up to 3 years in domestic violence cases the starting point taken will depend on the injury inflicted making reference to other cases decided with lesser sentences entered is not very helpful each case must turn on its own particular facts and the view of the judge of those facts at the time it is even worse to compare sentences for different crimes as mr waqainabete would have me do i now state that the tariff for wounding s 261 are sentences of imprisonment between 9 and 12 months but wounding in domestic violence cases creates a tariff of 12 months to 3 years depending on the following factors the seriousness of the wound degree of provocation remorse dangerousness weapon used as in all domestic violence cases reconciliation is to be viewed with scepticism the aggrieved partner will invariably say that he or she has forgiven the perpetrator and they have reconciled because he she wants the previous status quo to be restored where they each received benefit from each other a plea of reconciliation can be mitigatory if there is evidence before the court of genuine reconciliation in domestic violence cases the presumption in favour of bail disappears and so should the possibility of suspension of sentences a domestic violence offence destroys the fabric of family life and it is a gross breach of trust for those reasons it can only be in the most exceptional cases that a sentence of imprisonment for domestic violence wounding would be suspended i agree with the appellant that the magistrate has seemingly punished her twice by taking a high starting point by starting at 24 months and saying as he did this high starting point subsumes the serious domestic violence attack he should not then go on to add time for degree of violence being high and aiming for a vulnerable area of the body he was correct in finding that the breach of trust and minimal provocation were valid aggravating factors pursuant to section 256 of the criminal procedure decree 2009 i set aside the sentence passed below and proceed to sentence the appellant afresh i adopt the same starting point of 24 months which is appropriate for the unprovoked violence perpetrated by the appellant on her husband i add to that 6 months for the aggravating features of breach of trust minimal provocation and the use of a knife a dangerous weapon from the interim total of 30 months imprisonment i deduct 9 months for the appellants strong mitigating features of being a first offender of being relatively young with two small children to be concerned for for the lack of pre meditation and her obvious remorse the interim term being now 21 months i deduct a full third for her early plea of guilty and co operation with the authorities the sentence that the accused will serve will be one of 14 months imprisonment for the reasons given earlier it will not be suspended i decline to order a minimum term that she should serve this sentence is to start on the date of sentence in the magistrates court which is the DATE the domestic violence restraining order issued by the magistrate is to remain in force until further

this case a minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment should be imposed in mohamed kasim v the state unreported cr case no 14 of 1993 DATE fiji court of appeal observed we consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point the victim faced a gang rape attack justice madigan in state v nairogorogo 2015 fjhc 687 hac14 2013 DATE has set out the tariff for gang rape between 9 15 years imprisonment and said the assault on this woman was a nasty violent group attack

for rape is 7 to 15 years kasim the range for a gang rape where all perpetrators are acting in agreement should be increased by making the lower starting point of the range to be a term of nine years

the rest of her life it has been repeatedly said by psychologists that the effect of sexual assault on victims is profound and prolonged having considered the gravity of the offending the gang rape situation and the impact of the victim i select a starting point of ten years imprisonment for all the accused it is a highly aggravating feature that the accused took advantage of a vulnerable girl and exploited her when she was helpless a girl is entitled to drink with boys and is entitled to the same respect that any drinking young man would extend to any male companion further victim joined the grog session on the insistence of the 3rd accused who is her cousin 3rd accused breached that trust she was forced to submit to the first offender by means of physical violence all five accused

76838,ruling 1 the 1st appellant was charged with one count of rape contrary to section 207 1 3 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 and the 2nd appellant was charged with two counts of rape contrary to section 207 1 3 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 2 the appellants pleaded guilty before the magistrates court of labasa and the magistrate transferred the case to the high court for sentencing 3 before the high court a fresh plea was taken and the appellants pleaded guilty to the charges and the 1st appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and the 2nd appellant was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment 4 the appellants have sought leave to appeal against their conviction and sentence on the following grounds a that the guilty plea was unequivocal because of the legal aid commission lawyers advice that they need to plead guilty and receive 2 3years sentence from the court or face the maximum sentence b that the girl victim they are alleged to have raped had been previously involved in random sexual intercourse from an early age and before she approached them she was casually involved in sexual activities and therefore the trial magistrate judge was wrong in law when they were convicted on their own plea of guilty and ordering severe sentences c that from the victims physical feature they had wrongly assumed that she was of the age of consent and the magistrate judge was wrong in law when he failed to judicially investigate the assumption they had made as it was only human error d that the summary of facts presented in court did not contain evidence in support of the offence charged e that there has been a great miscarriage of justice that has been occasioned f that the sentence ordered by the high court is too harsh 5 the appellants were not represented when they appeared before the magistrates court and have stated that they were advised by a legal aid commissions lawyer to plead guilty they were however not sentenced by the magistrate and were referred to the high court in the high court they were represented and a fresh plea had been taken and they had pleaded guilty and admitted the facts as presented by the prosecution 6 in the above circumstances their ground of appeal that their plea of guilt was unequivocal is not of much substance as they were represented by counsel in the high court who would have advised them the first ground of appeal has no merit 7 the second ground of appeal is on the basis that the victim had sexual experience previously the victim was 12 years and 8 months old and hence under 13 years of age according to section 207 3 of the crimes decree a child under the age of 13 is incapable of giving consent therefore the fact that the victim had consented and had previous sexual experience as asserted by the appellants does not enure to their benefit therefore the second ground lacks merit 8 ground c is to the effect that the girls physique made them assume that she was of a consenting age the girl was under 13 years and according to section 224 of the crimes decree no 44 of 2009 it is immaterial in the case of any of the offences committed with respect to a person under a specified age that the accused person did not know that the person was under that age or believed she was not under that age therefore their belief that the girl was over 13 years was immaterial this ground too lacks merit 9 the next ground urged as ground d is that the summary of facts presented in court did not contain evidence in support of the offence charge the charge that was made out against the appellants set out the facts of the offence clearly and further it appears from the record that the appellants had admitted the facts which has been recorded by the learned trial judge before convicting the appellants it is the record of the court that can be relied upon regarding the proceedings that took place in court and not any other assertions made by the appellants this ground too therefore lacks merit 10 the next ground of appeal e is that the sentences imposed on the appellant were too harsh when imposing the sentences on the two appellants each appellants position was considered separately by the learned trial judge as regards the 1st appellant the learned trial judge commenced the sentencing after considering the tariff for such offences which was considered as being 11 to 16 years the commencing point of 12 years was at the lower end of the scale and considering the victims age as an aggravating factor increased the sentence by 2 years and taking into account the mitigating factors reduced 4 years and arrived at the sentence of 10 years 11 as regards the 2nd appellant the starting point was taken as 12 years and considering the victims age the fact that the victim was a niece of the appellant and that he had raped the victim on more than one occasion increased the sentence by 2 years reduced 3 years for the mitigating factors and arrived at the sentence of 11 years imprisonment 12 the manner in which the learned trial judge had sentenced the appellants cannot be faulted in the above circumstances and therefore the ground of appeal against sentence has no merit 13 therefore the applications of the appellants for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence are refused order of court applications for leave to appeal against conviction

aid refused the appellant s application the charge was valid in law and the facts admitted by the appellant disclosed the charged offence 9 i find the learned magistrate conducted the proceedings with utmost fairness to the appellant and there is nothing in the record to support the appellant s contentions that his plea was equivocal and that he was prejudiced by lack of legal representation 10 i reject the contention by the appellant that he pleaded guilty because he was advised by some police officers there is nothing in the record to support the claim of the appellant nor is there any evidence before me of such pressure on the appellant to plead guilty by the police officers 11 i am satisfied that the plea of the appellant was freely and voluntarily made and that he was properly convicted 12 the learned magistrate gave careful and detail reasons for the sentence imposed on the appellant 13 the learned magistrate correctly identified the starting point of 10 years imprisonment for rape of a child asesela drotini v state cr app no aau001 of 2005 the learned magistrate said the complainant in this matter was 7 years old at the time you raped her she was at an age where all young girls need love care understanding nurturing and protection what she could not get from her biological father as a result of a broken home she expected from you for after all you were the provider in the family not only for her for her other siblings and also for her mother who was by now your wife you however used your authority and trust not to protect her but to violate her you made her the target of your personal desires and gratification having no regard for the physical and mental trauma you no doubt caused her i therefore pick as my starting point the term of 10 years imprisonment after violating her you then kept her under siege with your threats for almost 2 years you had no regard for whatever emotional and psychological effect that she may have from your mere presence in the home this is reflected clearly by the fact that only when you left home after an argument with her mother was she able to complain about your offending to her for that i increase the term by 2 years to 12 years imprisonment in considering your previous good character your family circumstances your genuine remorse your cooperation with the police and your guilty plea i reduce the sentence by 2 years to that of 10 years imprisonment there is nothing more available apart from what i have considered to mitigate this offending you will therefore serve a term of 10 years imprisonment 14 i endorse the sentencing remarks of the learned magistrate this was indeed a dreadful offence committed on a vulnerable child of a very tender age the appellant grossly breached the trust placed on him by the victim and her mother the offence was further aggravated by the threats to the victim by the appellant to prevent her from complaining the learned magistrate was justified to take a serious view of the offence after discounting for the aggravating and mitigating factors the learned magistrate imposed a sentence of 10 years imprisonment 15 the sentence of 10 years imprisonment on the objective assessment of the facts in this case is neither excessive nor wrong in principle 16 the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed daniel goundar judge at

DATE the learned counsel for the appellant filed a renewed application 3 in the renewed application the appellant relied on the following grounds against the conviction namely that the learned judge had erred in law and denied the appellant a fair hearing because of non disclosure before or during trial of a letter dated DATE purporting the allegation against the appellant to be false and fabricated that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors how to approach the expert opinion evidence that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up against the sentence 4 the following grounds were urged as against the sentence namely that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to separately discount the 9 months the appellant had spent in remand that the learned trial judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature c that the sentence was in breach of section 14 2 n of the constitution of the republic of fiji islands to lead fresh evidence 5 in order to justify the reception of fresh evidence it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial lord denning in ladd v marshall 1954 3 all er 754 this is one of the well established principles of law to qualify the allowance of fresh evidence at the outset of the submissions counsel for the appellant withdrew the application to lead fresh evidence for the reason that the appellant was aware of the document well before the commencement of the trial that he intended to lead in fresh evidence ground a on the convictions too was withdrawn for the reason that this question is based on the document intended to be led in fresh evidence the learned counsel for the appellant confined his appeal to grounds b c on the conviction and grounds a b c on the sentence evidence 6 the prosecution case consists of evidence of the victim pgs 129 40 dr hanif 141 2 ms malimali grandmother of the victim and mother in law of the appellant 143 146 and the investigating officer d c kumar 146 147 the appellant did not give evidence and did not call any witnesses but rather exercised his right to remain silent evidence of the victim 7 at the time of giving evidence in 2012 the victim was 14 years of age the charges span from the year 2006 to 2010 the appellant is the father of the victim the victim was living with her mother father appellant two brothers and a younger sister she described the incidents from 2006 the victim had been used to sleeping in her room in 2006 the appellant had called her to his room to sleep beside him that night she said that she felt her father touching her body the shoulders breasts and the stomach were caressed in 2007 when she was attending class 3 in school the appellant had got down the victim to sleep beside him this time the appellant had removed her top and kissed her cheek she was told not to tell anyone again in 2008 she recollected that her mother was doing the night shift the appellant had got her to sleep with him her younger brother ben too had slept next to the appellant in the night the appellant had inserted his penis into her vagina and had sex with her for a few minutes she was told to keep it a secret which she says she did 8 again in 2009 she remembered spending time at her uncle s with her sister and two brothers the appellant brought them back to the house that night the appellant had got her and her younger brother to sleep with him whilst she was sleeping the appellant had started touching her shoulders and breasts when her mother returned home the appellant had not opened the door for her when she knocked again the appellant had got ben to open the door after that her parents had had a fight and the appellant had slept with ben in the sitting room the appellant having called her several times to come to the sitting room to sleep she had gone and slept in the sitting room in the night the appellant had again taken her clothes off and put his penis into her vagina while he was doing this the mother had come and put the lights on and said in fijian the translation of which is that akuila appellant see what you have done to this child filthy the mother had wanted to go to the police the appellant did not allow her in the morning the mother had asked the appellant to buy some biscuits from the shop while the appellant was away the mother had inquired about the happenings and she had revealed everything to her 9 again in 2010 while her mother was away the appellant had started to touch her body the appellant had told the victim that his wife is refusing to have sex with him and that that is the reason for behaving in this manner she also said that the appellant had given her 5 to keep her mouth shut she said that in april 2011 referred to as last year while giving evidence in 2012 she had told about this to her grandmother referring to the time she said that that was the day her grandmother came to take away the brush cutter that time she had taken the two granddaughters with her it was on the following day that this was revealed to the grandmother in her house on the same day they had gone to the police after going to the police station the grandmother had lodged a complaint later the victim was examined by a lady doctor 10 in the evening the victim s mother and the appellant had come to the grandmother s house and started a fight answering the question in cross examination what you have told the court that your father had sex with you is a false story she said no it is a true story pg 135 when it was suggested to her that nothing had happened in the sitting room between her and her father in 2009 she accepted it she denied it when she was told that in 2008 nothing had happened between her and her father she categorically said that in 2008 she had sexual intercourse with her father 136 again when she was asked as to what she had told the police regarding 2008 she said i told them that father and i had sexual intercourse 11 at page 138 she said that it was in 2009 that her mother saw father having sex with her she also denied when it was suggested to her that she lied to court about touching her i put it to you you lied to court about touching you no i did not lie again she answered as follows to a question suggesting that she was lying i am putting it to you that you lied to court about your father touching you she said i am not lying i am telling the truth she also denied when it was suggested to her that her grandmother coached her to make a false allegation against the appellant pg 139 q is it true you have been coached by your grandmother to make a false allegation against your father a no that is not true however the last question by the learned counsel for the defence is as follows q do you agree the complaint of rape is false a yes pg 140 it is to be noted that the questions prior to that are questions to which the answer had to be yes as to this answer the learned counsel for the prosecution and the learned trial judge got no clarification considering the manner of answering questions in relation to rape it appears that this answer alone would not negate her previous position that she was raped medical evidence 12 dr hanif has obtained her mbbs from the fiji school of medicine in 2009 she had been working at the namaka health centre while she was working at the nadi hospital in their general outpatient department she had dealt with 5 to 10 cases of sexual abuse the victim was examined by her on DATE at 11 a m she was told by the victim that she was sexually assaulted by her father on several occasions she has recorded this as the history of the victim on examination she had found that her hymen was not intact the reason may be vaginal penetration under cross examination she admitted that the reason for the absence of the hymen could be due to vigorous sports activity and also congenital absence of it in this case however there is no evidence of the victim having engaged in any kind of sports activities the grandmother s evidence 13 she has 9 children and 18 grand children she remembered the date DATE on that day she had gone to her daughter livia to collect her brush cutter that day she had taken her two granddaughters to her house it was on the following day that the victim had told her that she was raped by the appellant she had related all happenings from 2006 onward in 2008 she had told that she was raped three times it had occurred on two occasions while her mother was away from home at work doing night shifts in 2009 the appellant had raped her in a hotel in suva the same year the appellant had got caught to his wife while having sex with the victim 14 after this revelation she had gone to the police and lodged a complaint the victim too had made a statement after that they had gone to the hospital the hospital was found closed that day the appellant had come to her house with his wife livia livia is her daughter livia had cried and said that the appellant would have to spend about 15 to 18 years in prison she had also told the witness not to treat her as her daughter and told the daughters not to treat her as their mother as everything had been told to the grandmother the witness said that her relationship with the appellant had previously been very good that was one reason for giving them her grass cutter to be used her relationship with her daughter livia too was very good whenever livia s two daughters fell ill the witness took them with her to look after prior to 2011 livia had worked in a hotel even after this incident her relationship with the appellant was good the appellant had asked this witness to pray for him and inquired whether this case could be closed in cross examination she said that she used to go to the victim s house on many occasions and had also taken the victim and her sister to her place many a time she used to talk to them she said she used to give them money and buy food and do shopping with them the grounds of appeal under conviction ground a was withdrawn ground b expert opinion 15 the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge whilst explaining evidence of dr mrs hanif had failed to direct the assessors on how to deal with expert evidence the impugned decision is in paragraph 22 of the summing up pg 57 which is as follows the witness called was dr mrs salma hanif she gave evidence and produced the medical report which she prepared after examining the virtual complainant she said she had examined the virtual complainant on the 26 4 2011 at the general outpatients department of nadi hospital she didn t find any external injuries on the virtual complainant at vaginal examination she had found that the hymen was not intact she is of the view that there was vaginal penetration she also told court that the hymen can be damaged due to vigorous exercise and sports activities it is also possible with congenital absence 16 the learned counsel submitted that the trial judge should have directed the assessors that the doctor was giving opinion evidence which the assessors are not bound to follow and the weight to be attached to it is a matter for them to decide in r v stockwell 1993 97 cr app r at 266 the court said it is for you to evaluate that evidence along with all other evidence in the case you decide whether or not to accept and to agree with his evidence as a whole or in fact or to reject it altogether 17 the learned counsel further submitted that the examination was done by the doctor 5 years after the first incident and 4 months after the last incident the learned counsel further submitted that the opinion of the doctor that the hymen was not intact and that there was vaginal penetration failed to expressly implicate the appellant as the perpetrator as such the failure to adequately direct the assessors that they are not bound by the expert opinion and the weight to be attached to it has caused substantial prejudice to the appellant argument of the learned counsel for the respondent on ground b 18 the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the learned judge did not err and also that there has been no occurrence of a miscarriage of justice the learned counsel submitted that the learned trial judge has made it amply clear in paragraphs 2 30 and 33 pgs 54 59 and 60 of his summing up that it was a matter for the fact finders what to make of the evidence the learned counsel submitted strenuously that expert evidence does not fall into a special category which a trial judge is required as a matter of law to give specific directions in relation to such evidence 19 the medical evidence is unchallenged that evidence is that the hymen of the victim is not intact at the time of giving evidence the victim was 14 years of age there is no evidence of the victim associating with any males the only man with whom she had had sex with was her own father the medical opinion for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration that is due to having had sex with someone the doctor cannot say who that someone is the victim s evidence is that it is the father although it was suggested to the doctor that a girl of the age of the victim can lose the hymen due to vigorous sports activity there is no such evidence it is true that the learned judge had failed to analyse the evidence and explain that the assessors are not bound by the opinion of the doctor that the losing of the hymen was due to vaginal penetration the learned judge said to the assessors that they are judges of facts he also said that if an opinion had been expressed by him with regard to facts that the assessors are not obliged to accept it the assessors were told that they have to consider all the evidence and decide it appears that there is no strict rule to say that the trial judge is bound to tell the assessors that they are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor it was held in fitz patrick 1999 crim l r 832 that a failure slavishly to follow this formula does not automatically render a conviction unsafe in this case i am of the view that it would have been better if the judge said to the assessors that they are not bound by the opinion expressed by the doctor that the reason for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration in addition to the opinion expressed by the doctor the vaginal penetration has been established through the evidence of the victim and the grandmother therefore not giving a warning that the assessors are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor cannot be considered as fatal however by considering the fact that the evidence led was short and it not being a complex case no prejudice was caused and no miscarriage of justice has occurred ground c 20 this ground is that the learned judge has erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in cross examination when the defence counsel suggested the proposition to the victim that the complaint of rape was false her answer was yes pg 140 the prosecution however failed to clarify on this issue and therefore this piece of evidence was unchallenged and could have caused a reasonable doubt in the evidence of the victim and her credibility the learned counsel submitted that the unchallenged evidence that the allegation of rape was false was enough for the assessors to draw an inference that the victim of the crime was not a credible witness and that there was a serious doubt whether the alleged offence actually happened or not it was necessary for the trial judge to put before the assessors clearly and fairly this argument in the summing up the court of appeal held in tamaibeka v state 1999 fjca 1 aau 0015u 97s DATE that the duty of a judge in any criminal trial is adequately and properly performed if he puts before the jury clearly and fairly the contentions of either side omitting nothing from this charge so far as the defence is concerned of the real matters upon which the defence but that does not mean to say he is to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence 21 the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the error is substantial and has caused the trial to miscarry the unchallenged admission by the victim of crime that the allegation of rape was false clearly indicates that the appellant is innocent and hence the learned counsel for the appellant moved that the conviction be quashed submission by the learned counsel for the respondent 22 the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the victim had already repeatedly denied the allegation that she was lying the trial judge refers to this in paragraph 21 of the summing up as follows you heard the defence counsel suggest to the virtual complainant that these incidents never happened and she is lying in court the complainant had rejected these suggestions i request you to consider the suggestions made by the counsel for the accused in the light of all the evidence before the court the defence counsel also submits that the virtual complainant had contradicted herself with her own evidence and the evidence of other witnesses it is up to you to decide whether the virtual complainant is making mistakes or deliberately lying in court 23 the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that notwithstanding this answer it was clearly open to the assessors and the judge to find the appellant guilty on the totality of the evidence 24 i have reproduced the related questions and answers in paragraphs 10 and 11 of this judgment it is unfortunate for both the prosecuting counsel as well as the learned judge to overlook the answer given by the victim to a question that was put to her having considered all the questions and answers given i am of the view that the answer given as yes would have been nothing but a slip the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the failure of the learned counsel for the accused to address this issue in his address to the assessors shows that this answer yes did not mean a denial of the incident omitting to refer to this solitary answer by the learned judge itself did not cause a miscarriage of justice grounds on sentence ground a 25 the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the period of remand should have been discounted separately after computing the sentence section 24 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 provides that if an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall unless a court otherwise orders be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender 26 the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge prior to the passing of 18 years imprisonment had considered the 9 months period the appellant had spent in remand this was considered as a mitigating factor the complaint of the learned counsel is the timing of the consideration of the period spent in remand the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that a departure from the best practice does not render the sentence wrong in principle the learned counsel further submitted that the trial judge has been too lenient in allowing a total deduction of 5 years 27 section 24 requires any period the offender had spent in custody to be considered as part of the term of imprisonment served in this case the period spent in custody is 9 months the sentence is 18 years the following factors have been considered in mitigation namely a having five more children b being a first offender c nine months period spent in remand d a letter from the wife requesting that the appellant be given a second chance in life e wife claiming that she needs the support of the husband for the above mitigating factors the learned judge has deducted 5 years 28 it appears that the above items d and e do not qualify to be as mitigatory factors obviously the huge reduction is after considering the 9 month period of incarceration although this 9 month period should have been reduced after passing the sentence considering the huge reduction already given i find that no prejudice has been caused to the appellant therefore this ground is without merit ground b 29 the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature the learned counsel complains that the learned judge had erred in law when he considered the fact of having sexual intercourse on many occasions as an aggravating factor the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the impugned comment relates to the fact that this is not a single offence that is an aggravating factor distinct from the element of the offence 30 it is an accepted principle that no person should be sentenced for offences not charged when a person is charged on the basis of a representative count the number of incidents of the offences covered in that count should not be taken as an aggravating factor on each representative count the victim testified on one incident of rape indecent assault therefore within each count repetitive offending cannot be taken as an aggravating factor however i find that the learned trial judge has considered the totality principle in sentencing when he considered the repetitive sexual acts in all five counts the learned judge has not considered repetitive acts within each count but in all five counts therefore a judge is entitled to apply the principle of totality and use them as aggravating factors this principle was recently enunciated in raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 cav 0003 2014 DATE gates cj held that the high level of the sentence had its origin in the seriously aggravating factors which were identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks they were i the petitioner was the complainant s stepfather who should have protected her instead he breached the trust expected of him and the breach was gross ii the rape offence took place continuously over a long period of time such an experience will surely scar her for the rest of her life iii she was a child 10 years the age of the child if very young could yet be an aggravating factor 31 therefore i am of the view that the learned judge has correctly considered the continuous sexual acts as aggravating factors ground c 32 the learned counsel for appellant submits that the sentence is in breach of section 14 2 n of the constitution of the republic of fiji islands the section is as follows every person charged with an offence has the right to the benefit of the least severe of the prescribed punishment if the prescribed punishment for the offence has changed between the time the offence was committed and the time of sentencing and the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that fixing the starting point at 15 years offends section 14 2 n of the constitution to conform to the provisions of the constitution the starting point should have been 10 years 33 the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that section 14 2 n has no application as the punishment for the offence of rape life imprisonment has not changed between the time the offence was committed and the time of imposing the sentence i too agree that section 14 2 n has no application and this ground too is without merit 34 in the circumstances i am of the view that ground b on conviction and ground a on the sentence are arguable and hence leave is granted only on those two grounds and refused on the rest of the grounds however for the reasons adumbrated the appeal is dismissed gamalath ja 35 i agree with the reasoning and the conclusions of basnayake ja

284123,s e n t e n c e mr pajiliai bale you have been charged with one count of sexual assault contrary to section 210 1 a of the crimes act which carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and one count of rape contrary to section 207 1 and 2 b and 3 of the crimes act which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment you pleaded guilty for these two counts on the DATE and DATE respectively having satisfied that you have pleaded guilty on your own free will and understood the consequence of your plea of guilty i now convict you for each of these two counts as charged according to the summary of facts which was submitted by the prosecution and admitted by you in open court you have committed these crimes on the victim while she came for a family gathering at her grandfather s place you are related to her as her cousin you were staying with your grandfather at his house you were watching tv with other kids including the victim in a room while the elders were having their gathering at that point of time you went closer to the victim and licked her vagina you then penetrate her vagina with your finger you told her not to tell anyone this is a case of sexual exploitation of a child by a known relative within her own family environment she is your cousin the victim was 8 years old at the time this crime took place the family environment is the most protective and appropriate environment for a child to grow up with confidence and safety close family members and relatives are the most trusted and dependable people surrounded during the developmental stages of a child therefore sexually assaulting a child within her own family environment by a known family member is one of the outrageous forms of sexual crime in view of the seriousness of this offence it is my opinion that such offenders must be dealt with severe and harsh punishment hence the purpose of this sentence is founded on the principle of deterrence and protection of community moreover the court must demonstrate in sentencing that the offenders of this nature are socially abhorrent hon chief justice gates in anand abhay raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 cav0003 2014 DATE held that the tariff for rape of a child is between 10 16 years imprisonment period justice madigan in state v epeli ratabacaca laca sentence 2012 fjhc 1414 hac252 2011 DATE has expounded the tariff for the offence of sexual assault as between 2 years to 8 years imprisonment where his lordship held that the maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment it is a reasonably new offence created in february 2010 and no tariffs have been set but this court did say in abdul kaiyum hac 160 of 2010 that the range of sentences should be between two to eight years the top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus the bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks a very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the united kingdoms legal guidelines for sentencing those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories category 1 the most serious contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia face or mouth of the victim category 2 contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victims body contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia or an object contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim category 3 contact between part of the offenders body other than the genitalia with part of the victims body other than the genitalia the victim was eight years old at that time it is clear that a crime of this nature adversely affects a child of this age hence i find the level of harm is substantially high in this crime you have committed this disgraceful sexual crime on the victim in very opportunistic manner you have exploited her young age and immaturity in order to satisfy your sexual greediness i accordingly find the decree of culpability in this offending is substantially high in view of the seriousness of this crime and the level of harm and culpability i select twelve 12 years as the starting point for the offence of rape and three 3 years for the offence of sexual assault you have blatantly breached the trust reposed in you by the victim as her cousin the age difference between you and the victim was about seventeen 17 years at the time of this crime took place i consider these factors as aggravating circumstances of this crime the learned counsel for the defence submitted in mitigation about your family circumstances however the family background of the offenders of this nature has very minimal mitigatory value you are a first offender you are 19 years old therefore it is appropriate to give you some substantial discount for your previous good character you pleaded guilty for these two counts at the early stages of this proceeding by doing that you have save the time of the court and also prevent the victim to recalling all these traumatic ordeal that she had gone through in view of the above discussed aggravating circumstances i increased two 2 years to reach interim imprisonment of fourteen 14 years for the offence of rape and five 5 years for sexual assault i reduce one 1 year for your previous unblemished character and three 3 years for your early plea of guilt your final sentence has now reached to ten 10 years of imprisonment for rape and one 1 year for sexual assault having considered the seriousness of this crime the purpose of this sentence your age and opportunities for rehabilitation i find eight 8 years of non parole period would serve the purpose of this sentence hence you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight 8 years pursuant to section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties act head sentence accordingly i sentence you for a period of ten 10 years imprisonment for the offence of rape contrary to section 207 1 2 b and 3 of the crimes act and one 1 year imprisonment for the offence of sexual assault contrary to section 210 1 a of the crimes act i further order that you are not eligible for any parole for a period of eight 8 years both sentences to be served concurrently actual period of sentence you have been in remand custody for this case for a period of nearly nine 9 months as you were not granted bail by the court in pursuant of section 24 of the sentencing and penalties act i consider the period of nine 9 months as a period of imprisonment that have already been served by you accordingly your actual sentencing period is nine 9 years and three 3 months of imprisonment with seven 7 years and three 03 months of non parole period since this incident involves with domestic violence i am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to consider making an order under the domestic violence act i accordingly make a permanent domestic violence restraining order against the accused with standard non molestation conditions and no contact conditions pursuant to section 24 and 28 of the domestic violence act the above domestic violence restraining order will be in force until this court or any other competence court is varied or suspended it furthermore if you breached this restraining order you will be charged and prosecuted for an offence pursuant of

269331,ruling 1 following a trial in the high court at labasa the appellant was convicted on two counts of rape and sentenced to a total term of 13 years imprisonment this is his application for an extension of time for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence 2 the factors to be considered for an enlargement of time are i the reason for the failure to comply ii the length of the delay iii is there a question which justifies serious consideration iv the degree of prejudice to the respondent in enlarging time livai nawalu v the state unreported criminal appeal no cav0012 2002 DATE 3 the appellant was sentenced on DATE he filed his appeal in person on DATE subsequently he engaged mr vakaloloma who also appeared for him at the trial 4 the length of the delay is about 1 year and 3 months the appellant has not given any compelling reasons for this long delay the victim gave evidence at the trial finality in criminal litigations involving vulnerable victims is an important consideration long delays can cause stress or anxiety for the victims in this case the length of the delay weighs against the granting of an extension of time 5 the question is whether there is merit in the grounds of appeal the grounds of appeal are i that the learned trial judge failed to give a balanced summing up that resulted in the conviction to be unsafe and unsatisfactory ii that the learned trial judge failed to properly direct himself and direct assessors according to law when the assessors gave verdict of guilty in this case largely built on the states of mind and identification evidence of the complainant that under all the circumstances of the case the finding of guilt was unsafe and unsatisfactorily and iii that the learned trial judge failed to properly direct himself and assessors according to law and facts of identification evidence as in this case the complainant identified the person who rape her to be having a gold filling in the upper interior teeth the assessors and the court were shown in court during the hearing that the appellant had no gold teeth in the upper interior teeth and were shown by opening his mouth that the appellant has missing teeth in the front interior of his mouth assessors continue and found him guilty although the identification evidence is important to be considered under all the circumstances of the case the finding of guilt is unsafe and is unsatisfactory and iv that the learned trial judge failed to direct assessors on the absence of interviewing officer who were supposed to give evidence and was not able to be cross examined by the defence and was not there to confirm and tender his interview records after the defence objected and insisted that the interviewing officer to be called to confirm the complainant statement that she identified the rapist at the time of the committal of the offence of rape that the person has gold teeth in the front teeth v that the learned trial judge failed to direct prosecution to ensure all its witnesses are present and be called to give evidence and be cross examined by the defence for the purpose of fair trial and that such non direction placed the appellant to disadvantage and that the verdict was therefore unsafe and vi that the learned judge placed undue emphasis and weight in summing up to the evidence paragraph h the analysis of the evidence sub paragraph ix and x of the identification but never place any emphasis on the issue of the complainants identification and recollection of the rapist who has gold teeth and evidence of a ip viliame tokalauvere the officer who was told of the identification and assisted in the identification parade and gave evidence of what he saw during the parade against the appellant but failed to confirm when appellant was asked by the court to open his mouth and see that the he has no gold teeth in front and has no teeth for that matter to draw any evidential reference which would have impacted the prosecutions case and vii that the learned judge failed to properly direct himself and the assessors in law and in fact on the issue of gold teeth that it was a matter of identification to confirm the offenders identification then a person without a gold tooth cannot be evidently correct to be the offender without gold teeth 6 the grounds of appeal are indeed poorly drafted all grounds can be condensed into two issues the first issue relates to one particular aspect of the identification of the appellant by the complainant the second issue relates to the prosecution not calling certain witnesses 7 the complainant was a 50 year old woman she was a widow she lived with her youngest son in a farming community at the outskirt of labasa town the first incident happened in september 2010 in relaying about the first incident she said she was in her farm at around 10 am when the appellant approached her he spoke to her for about 30 minutes she noticed that he had a gold plated tooth he convinced her that someone was stealing her goat the complainant left to see if that was true he followed her and forced her to the ground by pressing her mouth he then had sexual intercourse without her consent when he left the victim said she was too embarrassed to report to anyone 8 on DATE the appellant returned to the victims home at around 10 am she was outside collecting coconuts when the appellant approached her he forced her to the ground covered her mouth and raped her she again noticed that he had a gold plated tooth 9 on DATE that is three days after the second incident the victim identified the appellant in a police identification parade in his caution interview the appellant denied the allegations 10 at trial the appellant elected to give evidence he denied the allegation he said he did not have a gold plated tooth he opened his mouth and showed it to the court that he did not have a gold plated tooth however it was noted that the appellant had some of his teeth missing when he gave evidence at the trial 11 the appellant contends that the trial judge did not give a fair and balanced summing up on the defence case that is the appellant did not have a gold plated tooth as alleged by the complainant at paragraph 13 of the summing up the trial judge gave directions that the appellants case was that since he did not have a gold plated tooth he was not the man who raped the complainant as alleged by her the trial judge left this issue to the assessors to determine by giving clear directions on the identification evidence in accordance with the guidelines in turnbull 1976 2 all er 549 the directions are contained at paragraphs 26 27 28 29 and 30 of the summing up the directions are correct in law and fact if there were indeed any misdirection counsel for the appellant could have raised it with the trial judge anand abhay raj v the state unreported criminal appeal no cav003 of 2014 DATE no re direction was sought by counsel at trial this issue of identification is not arguable 12 as far as the issue of calling of the witnesses is concerned the prosecution did not rely on those witnesses nor did the prosecution rely on the appellants caution interview there was no need for the interviewing officer to give evidence in any event if the defence required the interviewing officer or any other witness who was not called by the prosecution they could have made an application before the trial judge to have the witness available for cross examination by not seeking to have the witness available for cross examination the

80046,sentence slavery trafficking in children 1 the two accused inoke raikadroka and mohammed sagaitu were convicted after trial of the offences as set out in the schedule hereto 2 the facts of the case were that in the middle of the year in 2012 the first accused inoke had met four girls in a suva city park one night three of the girls were sisters aged 18 17 and 15 at the time and the fourth was their friend all had been working as sex workers under the control of one darren the two younger sisters are girl x aged 17 and girl y aged 15 referred to it in the charges at the time the girls appeared to be destitute with no place to go so he knowing that they were darrens girls made them a proposition he took them for dinner followed by a drink party in his room at the elixir motel at that party they discussed the sex business fees the splitting of fees for commission and he asked them if they were prepared to work for him they agreed but then immediately arose the darren problem darren had heard that his girls had gone with inoke and he was therefore texting inoke making vile threats and demanding to know where they were inoke kept the two younger sisters there for 2 3 months at the elixir motel having them provide sexual services for clients that he arranged at first he received a commission from the fee paid but later he asked from them for all of the money which they gave to him in return for their keep that keep consisted of the room charge being paid food entertainment by way of drugs and alcohol beautification and nice clothes and shoes all to make more attractive his products as he referred them as in his cautioned interview the girls had come from a dysfunctional family where the parents were separated the father was an alcoholic there was a domineering and erratic grandmother many times there was no food in the house and they were sent to school without lunch or lunch money 3 when the clients became scarce and the expenses too high inoke moved operations from the motel room to a flat he rented at raiwai he moved the girls with him and from there they continued the business of providing sexual services inoke arranging clients and arranging for them to go to hotels or motels to service the clients the second accused from thereon figures prominently in that he too arranged clients and took the girls by taxi usually to their assignments there was no doubt that he knew what the girls were going to do on those occasions 4 after a few months in raiwai they all went their own ways after an altercation with the neighbours the girls moved to a motel and the first accused went to nadi to try something new because as he said in evidence sex work has a shelf life it would seem that nothing new eventuated because at different times the two sisters x and y went to nadi on arrangement by inoke to provide sexual services to clients that he had secured there the offences 5 slavery is committed when a person either inside or outside fiji intentionally owns a slave or exercises over a slave any of the powers attaching to the right of ownership 1 there are other limbs of the offence which do not pertain to this case the maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment 6 reduced to simple terms then the offence denotes having a person with you and doing things in respect of that person which would be indicative of ownership 7 in this case the evidence of ownership came from three sources 1 a description by the accused of the girls as his products 2 his fear of and hiding the girls from their previous owner darren and 3 the manner in which he kept the girls both at the motel and in the flat at raiwai selling them for sexual services to clients that he arranged and keeping the money that they earned this money he spent extravagantly on the girls indulging them in new clothes shoes food and alcohol but then slaves can live in palaces as well as sordid hovels the life of slavery these girls were subjected to was a life of having to provide sexual services on demand and in not retaining the money earned by those services for themselves but all of it going to the controller or pimp 8 slavery is the utter abuse of the human right to freedom as recognized in clauses 10 and 11 of fijis constitution 2013 no person may be held in slavery or servitude and every person has the right to freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment 9 the treatment of these teenage girls at the hands of the first accused was egregious they were sold like objects and forced to work with no pay they were used by him to make profit 10 it is perhaps tempting to say that the girls were willing and agreed to this arrangement and therefore they cannot be said to be slaves such a proposition however ignores two very important factors first is that a 15 year or a 17 year old girl is hardly mature enough to know what is good for her and to realize she is being exploited because she is slim and very attractive secondly they were inveigled into this servitude by coercive manipulation it is a condition and slavery is a condition that sociologists refer to as situational coercion the girls coming from a broken alcoholic home with no food are suddenly confronted with food every day new clothes beauty treatments entertainment and with no real alternative place to go they were coerced or manipulated by the situation to remain in servitude a dependency was created which is just as powerful a force as physical threat or force by violence or locks on the door the situation sadly removed their power of choice 11 apart from this condition of slavery which is obnoxious in itself the situation was aggravated by the fact that the slaves were children being 17 years and 15 years further aggravation can be seen that the condition was extended over a long period of at least seven months and even thereafter the girls were on call to go to nadi to service more clients for inoke 12 there has never been a case of slavery in fiji before nor has either defence counsel been able to provide authorities from other commonwealth jurisdictions 13 because it is such an outrageous and shameful crime denying the victim s their constitutional and community rights a long term of imprisonment must be imposed 14 fiji has ratified the international treaty called convention to suppress the slave trade and slavery 1926 ratified by fiji in 1972 whereby article 5 the parties undertake to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading slave holding and enslavement fiji being a signatory to the treaty has now enacted laws against slavery with severe penalties and it is incumbent on the judiciary to honour that sentiment and pass heavy sentences accordingly 15 in recognition of the maximum penalty this court takes a starting point for the crime of ten years imprisonment for the aggravation of the slaves being children which the court regards as being very serious indeed i add a further term of 5 years to the sentence for the aggravation of long term enslavement i add a further period of two years to the sentence bringing the interim total to a term of 17 years imprisonment 16 in mitigation counsel for the first accused tells me that inoke is 24 years old and currently unemployed he comes from a broken family and was reared by an aunt he dropped out of school early making a living by doing odd jobs before becoming a sex worker he met the two girl victims in the course of his work and he says they spent 8 months together because they shared the experience of coming from broken homes and of having to survive through sex work he still maintains that he had no interest in being a slave master but wanted merely to provide for them and treat them as family 17 inoke has one previous charge for theft and he is still serving a suspended sentence for that offence he can therefore have no credit for being of good character nor do his family circumstances afford any great degree of credit 18 however in recognition of his time spent in custody his pathetic upbringing which forced him onto the streets and his generosity towards his girls i deduct two years from the sentence i deduct a further year for his relative youth meaning he will serve a total sentence of 14 years for this crime 19 this is the sentence i pass for each of count one and count two 20 each term for count one and count two will be served concurrently domestic trafficking in children trafficking is a breach of human rights because it objectifies human beings 2 21 as with slavery this offence has never come before the courts in fiji before and therefore there are no authorities that establish an appropriate sentence for the offence 22 domestic trafficking in children created by s 117 of the crimes decree 2009 is proved by i moving a person from a to b in fiji ii the person is under the age of 18 iii the mover intends that after he moves the person to point b the person will be used for sexual services or otherwise exploited 23 moving the child is a very widely defined term it can be arranging or facilitating in this present case the first accused at times organized transport to collect one of the girls at other times accompanied a girl to the place of assignation the second accused more often that not would accompany the girl in a taxi to the motel apartment and wait in the hope that he would get a tip 24 there have been two previous trafficking cases in fiji but not of children and both were international trafficking in the case of murti 2010 fjhc 514 per goundar j november 2010 it concerned an indian national who organized the transportation of seven fellow countrymen to travel to new zealand claiming that he had work for them there each paid about 150 000 rupees for the transport he had them transit through fiji where he planned to abandon them at the border an official became suspicious and detained all 8 men the facilitator was charged with trafficking under s 112 3 of the crimes decree an offence which has extra territorial jurisdiction after trial the learned judge found that the act of abandoning them without funds was an act of recklessness as to exploitation in his sentence goundar j said the crimes decree 2009 which came into effect in DATE create a number of offences designed to fulfill fijis obligations under the united nations convention against transitional organised crime and two of its three protocols the protocol to prevent suppress punish trafficking in persons especially women and children the trafficking protocol and the protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land sea and air although fiji has not signed these international conventions by criminalizing human trafficking and smuggling under the domestic law fiji has shown commitment to effectively address this global problem trafficking is a human rights issue traffickers are motivated by greed to take advantage of vulnerable victims traffickers are motivated by greed to take advantage of vulnerable victims traffickers use coercive tactics including deception fraud imitation isolation treat and use of physical force to control their victims the victims are generally subjected to degrading forms of exploitation such as forced prostitution domestic servitude and other kinds of work 25 in the murti case the judge sentenced the trafficker to 6 years imprisonment while saying that there was no evidence of physical exploitation in the case of laojindemanee and others hac 323 12 a case decided in this court the traffickers had brought three thai girls into the country the girls having been told that they were going to work as masseuses in an idyllic setting by the sea it was only on arrival that they learned that they were to become sex workers although there was international trafficking from thailand there was one element of domestic trafficking in the case where there was a driver employed to bring the girls from nadi airport to suva city where they were to be based he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment factors being in his favour that he was a rather small cog in this wheel of crime syndicate trafficking the girls were all adults and there was no evidence that he knew he was driving them to exploitation the maximum penalty for the crime was 12 years neither murti nor laojindemanee are applicable to this case where the trafficking is of children the children were being exploited for gain and the maximum penalty is 25 years 26 the accepted tariff for rapes of children is from 10 to 16 years anand abhay raj aau 0038 2014 and there is no reason why domestic trafficking in children should not attract a sentence which is similar if not greater than that range while not detracting from the crime of rape of a child which is an abominable crime trafficking a child for sexual services is more serious in that it is not one single act of violence but is the making available a child for innumerable sexual acts for money this money is not recompensed directly to the child as a reward but is used by either the first accused or the second accused as profit that they would spend on themselves and the girls the sexual services to be demanded of the child after transportation were of course unknown and the potential for sexual abuse is immeasurable the knowledge and intent of either of the accused that a payment had or would be paid to perform the sexual acts demanded removes any power the child might have had to consent or not to whatever act that was demanded of her this exploitation for financial gain is unspeakably loathsome 27 there is no reason why this crime should not attract sentences in the range of 12 to 18 years 28 i take a starting point for each of the trafficking convictions of 15 years in looking at the first accused separately i add to that a term of 3 years for the fact that girl x told the court that when the first accused took her in she had no idea of what to in being a sexual worker and at the initial orientation party in the elixir motel the first accused was a party to a training demonstration set up by another girl to show her how to please a man to pervert a 17 year old girl in such manner is seriously aggravating from the interim total of 18 years i deduct 2 years from that total for the first accuseds relative youth and pathetic childhood which forced him into the trade he does not have a clear record which would allow any further discount the final sentence for the first accused for each of the trafficking charges will be a term of 16 years these terms are to be served concurrently with each other and concurrent to the term imposed for slavery making a total term of imprisonment for the first accused to be one of sixteen years he will serve a minimum of 14 years imprisonment before being eligible for parole 29 for the second accused i take the same starting point of 15 years imprisonment for each of the two trafficking offences he has been convicted of 30 the second accused is also 24 years old and from a broken home he has supported himself by odd jobs and sex work since he was 12 years old he has a clear record his counsel says that he is remorseful which i have indeed seen throughout the trial unlike the first accused who has shown no remorse whatsoever and has even an occasions shouted out his views from the dock 31 to his credit the second accused has devoted time and effort to a sex workers union known as san little is known of what the union does for the sex workers but if nothing else education on the severe penalties contained in our crimes decree for offences of slavery and trafficking should be high on their agenda the second accuseds membership of the union does in some respects work against him because a union should be in a position to protect children from the more wretched and ignominious facts of sex work 32 there is no aggravating features of the second accuseds crimes to add to the sentence the crime itself subsumes the unsavoury and despicable features of the offence he does have a good deal of mitigation in his favor i clear record ii relative youth iii time in remand iv a wretched childhood forcing him to live by his own wits since 12 years old v obvious remorse 33 his work in the sex workers union cancels itself out by credit for such help as opposed to the unions essential role to educate sex workers 34 for the mitigating features above i deduct a period of three years meaning that the second accused will serve a total term of 12 years for each of the two trafficking offences he has been convicted of these terms will be served concurrently and he will serve a minimum term of 10 years before being eligible for parole summary

prematilaka j and fernando j on DATE dismissed the petitioner s appeal against the conviction and sentence and affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned high court the petitioner now seeks special leave to appeal from the supreme court against the judgment of the court of appeal dated DATE dismissing the petitioner s appeal and affirming his conviction and sentence before dealing with the petitioner s application for special leave i would like to outline the summary of facts in this case as follows facts in brief the victim in this case had been 7 years old at the time of the incident the petitioner is her father s brother who was living with the victim s family on the day of incident as usual she had gone to school and after the school was over the petitioner is alleged to have picked her up at a certain point and taken to the kitchen of another nearby house where no one was present in the kitchen he is said to have committed all four acts set out in separate counts a neighbouring boy called john davis had seen through the window the petitioner getting the victim to suck his penis inside the kitchen and he had alerted his mother it is relevant to state at this stage that the petitioner in his caution interview at page 103 of the supreme court case record has admitted commission of all three acts of rape and one sexual assault on the victim after a voir dire trial the caution interview was held to be admissible in evidence agreed facts it is useful to consider the agreed facts in this case as parties at the trial court have reached a consensus with regard to the relationship of the petitioner and the victim child who was 7 years old at the time of the incident at page 81 of the high court record the state counsel and the defence counsel on behalf of the parties have reached the following agreed facts it is agreed that the accused is mohammed alfaaz the accused is a hairdresser by profession 2 it is agreed that the complainant is an it is agreed that the complainant and the accused are related the accused is the uncle of the complainant it is agreed that the accused resides with the family of the complainant at sabeto nadi the agreed facts establishes the identity of the accused petitioner and the identification was not an issue at the trial in this case as the complainant when testifying identified the petitioner as the person who raped her and the petitioner was residing in the same house with the same family the petitioner was well known to the victim as her uncle jurisdiction of the supreme court the supreme court derives exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all judgments of the court of appeal under section 98 3 b of the constitution of the republic of fiji section 98 4 of the republican constitution of fiji also provides that an appeal may be brought to the supreme court from a final judgment of the court of appeal unless the supreme court grants leave to appeal section 7 2 of the supreme court act no 14 of 1998 sets out the stringent criteria for grant of special leave which is as follows in relation to a criminal matter the supreme court must not grant special leave to appeal unless a question of general legal importance is involved a substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved or substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur it is manifest from the above provisions contained in section 7 2 of the supreme court act of 1998 special leave should not be granted as a matter of course in aminiasi katonivualiku v state 2003 fjsc crim app no cav 0001 1999s DATE clarified the jurisdiction of the supreme court at page 3 as follows it is plain from this provision that the supreme court is not a court of criminal appeal or general review nor is there an appeal to the court as a matter of right and whilst we accept in an application for special leave some elaboration on the grounds of appeal may have to be entertained the court is necessarily confined within the legal parameters set out above to an appeal against the judgment of the court of appeal which in this instance was an order for new trial in dip chand v state cav0014 2012 the supreme court observed as follows given that the criteria set out in section 7 2 of the supreme court act no 14 of 1998 are extremely stringent and special leave is not granted as a matter of course the fact that the majority of the grounds relied on by the petitioner for special leave to appeal have not been raised in the court of appeal makes the task of the petitioner of crossing the threshold requirements for special leave even more difficult time and again the supreme court in fiji has pronounced in a series of judgments that it is an extremely difficult task for a petitioner to pass the stringent threshold criteria contained in section 7 2 of the supreme court act no 14 of 2014 the petitioner has a greater burden to establish his ground of appeal as a question of general legal significance and that there is substantial and grave injustice that warrants leave from the supreme court in the recent judgment in sharma v state 2017 fjsc 5 cav0031 2016 the supreme court on threshold requirements in section 7 2 of the supreme court act of 1998 observed as follows it is observed that the injustice that is said to have occurred must not only be one that is substantial but also one that is grave as such even if the party succeeds in establishing that some injustice had been caused that by itself may not be sufficient to obtain relief unless the party is capable of establishing that the injustice referred to is one that meets the threshold laid down in section 7 2 paragraph c of the supreme court act the supreme court went on further and observed the supreme court in fiji is not a court in which decisions of the court of appeal will be routinely reviewed the requirement for special leave is to be taken seriously it will not be granted lightly too low a standard for its grant undermines the authority of the court of appeal and distract this court from its role as the final appellate body by burdening it with appeals that do not give rise to matters of general importance or principles or in the criminal jurisdiction substantial and grave injustice i agree with the learned state counsel who referred to this judgment in the written submissions of the respondent as the petitioner has a difficult task to establish that substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur if special leave is not granted now i would deal with the grounds of appeal urged by the petitioner in the supreme court in the amended petition of appeal dated DATE filed by the petitioner the grounds of appeal in the supreme court has been restricted to only two grounds against the conviction and one ground of appeal against the sentence which are as follows grounds of appeal against conviction i the learned judge had erred in not directing the assessors on the medical report ii the learned judge in not adequately directing the assessors on the circumstantial evidence ground of appeal against the sentence the appellant was punished twice by the trial judge for the same evidence when the petitioner s application was taken up for hearing on DATE the petitioner was represented by a counsel from the legal aid commission the learned counsel submitted that the medical report tendered in evidence at the trial does not show any evidence in regard to the 3rd count on anal penetration the findings of the doctor who medically examined is only in relation to the vaginal area and his submission that the learned judge failed to adequately direct the assessors on the absence of any findings of anal penetration constituted a substantial and grave error it is relevant at this stage to state that at the hearing of this appeal on DATE when the court questioned the learned counsel for the petitioner as to whether at the end of summing up by the learned trial judge the opportunity was afforded to the petitioner for redirection if there was a non direction on the question of insufficient evidence of the medical report about the 3rd count the reply by the counsel was no the court pointed out and drew the attention of the counsel to the last paragraph 74 of the summing up of the judge at page 49 of the summing up dated DATE wherein it is stated that any redirections learned counsel finally agreed with the court s observation it is obviously clear from the case record that the invitation was afforded to the petitioner to ask for redirection but the petitioner did not seek to utilize it it appears from the failure of the petitioner not to seek redirection when the opportunity was afforded by court that the petitioner has done this deliberately to find an appeal point in varasiko tuwai v state 2016 fjsc 35 DATE the supreme court made the following observation before i go any further i must say that the trial judge had asked the parties if they needed any re directions in the matter the parties did not seek any re directions on the grounds they alleged that the directions were inadequate was this done for a deliberate reason to find a ground of appeal if that is so the appellate courts approach must be stringent litigants must not wait for trial judges to make mistakes to find a point of appeal the transparent nature of litigation requires that the trial judge be given an opportunity to correct any errors made if the trial judge has asked the parties to seek re directions an they do not and subsequently raise the issue in the appellate court then in the absence of any cogent reason it should be held against that party as having employed a deliberate tactic to find an appeal point the court of appeal in dealing with this ground of appeal observed in paragraph 42 of the judgment as follows the supreme court and this court on more than one occasion had commented on constant complaints on alleged non directions and misdirection knowing that i am being repetitive it is nevertheless apt once again to quote from raj v state petition for special leave to appeal no cav 0003 of 2014 DATE 2014 fjsc 12 where the supreme court said at trial the defence counsel could have raised with the judge the proper direction to the assessors the raising of direction matters in this way is a useful function and in following it counsel assist in achieving a fair trial in doing so they act in their client s interest the appellate courts will not look favourably on cases where counsel have held their seats hoping for an appeal point when issues in directions should have been raised with the judge we do not believe this was intended in this case it is important to address our minds carefully when there is a ground of appeal on misdirection or non direction alleging that the learned trial judge has erred by failing to direct the assessors adequately on non direction and the appellate courts must not approach the issue leniently if the opportunity had been afforded to the petitioner for re direction at the end of summing up and if they did not seek re direction in the present case the petitioner was asked by the trial judge whether he sought any redirection para 74 of the summing up high court record supra at the end of the summing up it appears from the record that there was no reply given by the petitioner this omission is in itself sufficient to disregard this ground of appeal in this court segran murti v the state crim app no cav0016 2008s DATE the doctor who testified in this case for the prosecution was one with 20 years experience she was not the doctor who examined the victim she said in her evidence that according to the medical report p 3 that the hymen extended and wide open and was not intact the professional opinion confirmed sexual assault on the victim either through penile penetration or fingering the doctor further said under cross examination by the defence counsel that there would have been a swelling in the vaginal area if there was penile penetration but that it will depend on the time of examination after the incident as it could have been healed she also testified and said that medical findings are consistent with the history the evidence of the medical report at page 106 p3 of the high court record shows that the victim had been examined by the doctor on 19 9 2012 two days after the incident on 17 9 2012 second ground of appeal against conviction on circumstantial evidence the petitioner alleged that the learned trial judge erred in not adequately directing the assessors on the circumstantial evidence at the trial before i deal with this ground of appeal it is relevant to consider the petitioner s caution interview statement dated DATE at page 103 of the high court record the caution interview statement has been admitted in evidence at the trial the prosecution case in the trial court was that the petitioner had sexually assaulted and raped the victim of 7 years old who was the niece of the petitioner in the caution interview the petitioner admitted the commission of all unlawful acts referred to in all four counts against him the petitioner s admission of the commission of sexual assault and rape of the victim contained in the caution interview is as follows q 13 where were you on

inserted my erected penis into her vagina and started pushing in and out q 17 then what happened a after some time i told her to turn around and then i inserted my penis inside her anus and started pushing in and out when i inserted my penis into her anus she cried but i still kept on doing it and after some time i told her to get up q 18 then what happened a then i let her suck my penis i was letting her suck my penis when one fijian boy saw us and i quickly pulled the clothes of p and told her not tell anyone and left from there q 19 can you saw me the place you had sexual intercourse with arasida a yes it is important to state that the caution interview evidence after it has been admitted in evidence at a voir dire trial regarding its voluntariness conducted by high court is not circumstantial evidence the petitioner s complaint is that the second ground of appeal against conviction relates to count 4 in the information and the court of appeal considered that there was no evidence brought out from the complainant when she testified in court on the 4th count on rape however court nonetheless found that the evidence of john davis who was an independent witness was sufficient to convict the petitioner i would like to reproduce the observations of the court of appeal when it considered that evidence in paragraph 29 of the judgment para 29 of the judgment therefore there is clear evidence by the victim that the appellant had committed the offences set out in the first three counts i agree that the victim s evidence has not touched on the allegation set out in count 4 i e penetration of her mouth but the evidence on that count is amply provided by john davis whose evidence remained intact even after cross examination it is to be noted that petitioner s caution interview evidence provided sufficient evidence to corroborate the victim s evidence and john davis s evidence on all four counts against the petitioner furthermore it can be seen from the child victim s evidence that that evidence supports the evidence of john davis john davis in his testimony at page 141 of the high court record said that they were in the kitchen it was munar s kitchen this is after school s over at first time i was standing about 25 feet he was not wearing any t shirt the girl was wearing her school uniform the question that the petitioner has raised on this ground appeal is that from the victim s evidence she does not speak of the allegation in respect of the anal penetration as charged in the fourth count it is to be noted that both the single judge and the full court of appeal were in agreement that john davis s evidence was not circumstantial but direct evidence john davis was an eye witness to the incident in relation to count four this piece of evidence of john was very powerful and convincing for the prosecution the petitioner however in his written submissions at paragraph 7 3 has conceded that john davis s evidence is direct evidence and not circumstantial evidence i would reproduce what the single judge of the court of appeal and full court observed in regard to john davis s evidence in the trial court in paragraph 10 of the ruling of the single judge dated DATE it is stated that in a trial where the prosecution relied on direct evidence as was in this case and where that direct evidence is sufficient for the learned judge to convict then the failure to direct on the circumstantial evidence that may have been adduced does not constitute a miscarriage of justice emphasis is mine the paragraph 44 of the court of appeal judgment refers to the complaint on circumstantial evidence by the petitioner and observed that however john s evidence is eye witness evidence and not a piece of circumstantial evidence he had given direct evidence on seeing the appellant getting the victim to suck his penis it is true that the victim had not spoken to that act in her evidence however the trial judge had placed the evidence of both the victim and john before the assessors who seemed to have believed and acted upon john s evidence in relation to the 4th count at page 144 of the high court record the victim had testified as follows q 31 this bad thing painful yes q 36 who removed sutana alfaaz q 38 this bad thing was done was it done by any part of alfaaz s body tongue q39 where did his use his tongue down q40 did he use another part of his body down q41 what you mean by down panu penis q 42 where did alfaaz use his panu down q 43 what is down pussy vagina q44 did alfaaz use panu anywhere else bump backside q45 did alfaaz use his panu anywhere else no q46 after alfaaz did this thing did he tell you anything yes not to tell anyone under cross examination q 47 i put it to you alfaaz never put his penis into your vagina he did q 49 i put it to you alfaaz never put his tongue into your vagina he did lick my vagina q50 i put it to you alfaaz never put his penis at your backside he did that q 52 i put it to you it was not mr alfaaz who raped you he did that the above evidence of the victim is supported by the caution interview evidence of the petitioner there is no apparent reason for the child victim to have falsely implicated the petitioner for having committed sexual assault and rape on her in rajinder raju v state of h p crim app no 670 of 2003 decided on 07 07 2009 r m lodha j while speaking on behalf of the supreme court of india said as follows a woman victim of sexual aggression would rather suffer silently than to falsely implicate somebody any statement of rape is an extremely humiliating experience for a woman she would not blame anyone but the real culprit while appreciating the evidence of the prosecutrix the courts must always keep in mind that no self respecting woman would put her honour at stake by falsely alleging commission of rape on her it appears from the caution interview evidence the petitioner refers to a fijian boy who saw petitioner and identified him as alfaaz in the kitchen and that fijian boy was john davis who testified in court for the prosecution and therefore the evidence of the caution interview of the petitioner the evidence of child victim and john davis s evidence were sufficient and strong evidence to convict the petitioner of all four counts as charged in kean v state crim app no aau 95 of 2008 DATE 2013 fjca 117 the court observed that in fiji under section 129 of the criminal procedure act 2009 a trial judge is no longer required to give a standard warning to the assessors where the evidence of a complainant in a trial for an offence of a sexual nature is not corroborated the supreme court of india in bharwada bhoginbhai hirjibhai v state of gujarat 1983 air 753 1983 scr 3 280 observed that corroboration is not a sine qua non for a conviction in a rape case in hassan v reginam criminal app no 57 of 1997 DATE 1978 fjca 18 made the following observation it is well established law that man may be convicted even of murder solely upon his confession r v sykes 1913 8 crim app p 233 mckay v the king 1935 54 clr 1 it has been stated in this court that it is customary to look for some evidence of surrounding circumstances which are consistent with the confession such evidence need not be corroboration in the strict sense of the term but merely evidence of facts which are not inconsistent with those set out in the confessional statements emphasis added i would now refer to a subsequently decided case in khan v state crim app no aau 0069 of 2007 wherein a similar view was expressed and observed that it is well established law that the accused may be convicted of any crime upon his own confession alone in the backdrop of the legal position stated above and having considered the evidence of the victim john davis and caution interview of the petitioner and the medical evidence i find that the unanimous opinion of the assessors and the trial judge s judgment in convicting the petitioner of all four counts is reasonable and correct in law in view of the above there is no reason for disturbing the decision of the court of appeal i agree with the decision of the court of appeal in dismissing the appeal of the petitioner against conviction this ground of appeal has no merit and should fail this ground of appeal should be dismissed ground of appeal against the sentence the petitioner s next complaint is that the petitioner was punished twice by the trial judge when sentencing him the petitioner alleges that the court appeal in its judgment at paragraph 51 found that the trial judge had fallen into error in double counting the aggravating factors but nonetheless court found that the sentence imposed on the petitioner to be justifiable he also complains that the court of appeal could have looked into the rehabilitation aspect when sentencing it is pertinent to state at the outset of dealing with this ground of appeal against the sentence that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him by the trial judge was manifestly excessive or wrong the petitioner was sentenced to 13 years 7 months and 15 days imprisonment by the high court with a non parole period of 12 years the learned trial judge has considered the mitigating factors on petitioner s age and that he was a first offender and the petitioner earned one year discount from the total sentence of 16 years the period the petitioner spent in remand was also deducted it is necessary to state briefly that this is a case where the victim was 7 years old at the time of the incident the victim was the petitioner s elder brother s daughter on DATE the petitioner lured the victim who was returning home from the school into a kitchen in a nearby house at that place the petitioner sexually abused and raped her the petitioner was found guilty of all four counts as charged by a unanimous decision of the assessors and was convicted accordingly according to the crimes decree act 2009 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment in fiji the maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years the petitioner was sentenced to 13 years 7 months and 15 days each in respect of counts 2 3 and 4 and he was sentenced to 8 years for count one the tariff for rape of an adult is 7 years to 10 years imprisonment in mohamed kasim v state 1994 fjca 25 aau 00221j 93 DATE in this case the court of appeal observed that we consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime more clearly reflect understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that here are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point in raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 crim app cav0003 of 2014 DATE the supreme court observed that rape is the most serious form of sexual assault society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences in paragraph 58 of the judgment the judge has correctly identified the tariff for rape of a child as between 10 16 years imprisonment the petitioner in this case complains that when adding aggravating factors the high court judge fell into error of double counting the court of appeal in paragraph 51 has agreed with the submission of the petitioner that the trial judge appears to have fallen into error the court of appeal observed that though there was an error on the part of the trial judge for double counting nonetheless the court found the totality of sentences imposed on the petitioner to be justifiable on the basis of the gravity and brutality of the offences and was well within the tariff the court of appeal considered carefully whether the errors committed by the trial judge in arriving at the sentence should disturb the ultimate sentences by referring to the relevant observations made by the supreme court in koroicakavu v the state crim app cav0006u 2005s DATE 2006 fjsc 5 wherein the court said that this argument misunderstands the sentencing process it is not a mathematical exercise it is an exercise of judgment involving the difficult and inexact task of weighing both aggravating and mitigating circumstances concerning the offending and recognizing that the so called starting point is itself no more than an inexact guide inevitably different judges and magistrates will assess the circumstances somewhat differently in arriving at a sentence it is the ultimate sentence that is of importance rather than each step in the reasoning process leading to it when a sentence is reviewed on appeal again it is ultimate sentence rather than each step in the reasoning process that must be considered different judges may start from slightly different starting points and give somewhat different weight to particular facts of aggravation and mitigation yet still arrive at or close to the same sentence that is what has occurred here and no error is disclosed in either the original sentencing or appeal process emphasis added the answer to the issue on errors by the trial judge if any is given in the above case it is finally the ultimate sentence that is material and not the step in the reasoning process it is useful to refer to the observations expressed by the fiji court of appeal in matasavui v state crim app no aau 0036 of 2013 30 september 2016 fjca 118 wherein court said that no society can afford to tolerate an innermost feeling among the people that offenders of sexual offenders of sexual crimes committed against mothers daughters and sisters are not adequately punished by courts and such a society will not in the long run be able to sustain itself as a civilized entity the court of appeal referred to the same judgment in paragraph 60 of the judgment which is being canvassed before this court having taken into consideration the gravity and cruelty of the case before court and observed that highest possible punishment should be given to the prospective offenders of sexual assault on children who are vulnerable to fall prey to the offenders i agree with the observations expressed by the court of appeal in this regard and would not hesitate to add further that the court of appeal had been lenient not to enhance the sentences on the petitioner in view of the aggravating factors in this case it is very useful to refer to the judgment of madigan j in state v mario tauvoli high court of fiji at lautoka crim case no hac 027 of 2011 decided on DATE wherein the court said rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in fiji at the time the legislation has dictated harsh penalties and courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society s abhorrence for such crimes our nation s children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound the court further went on to observe that in paragraph 6 it is now well settled that sentences for rape of children should be within the range of ten to fifteen years this court in state v m d hac 129 of 2010 l took a starting point of 15 years for a stepfather who raped his 13 year old stepdaughter the learned high court judge in that case took a term of 12 years as his starting point for the offence of rape in that case the accused was the stepfather who was in a position of trust in the care and protection of the child and had breached the trust the victim was the stepdaughter who was 14 years old therefore the judge had added four years as aggravating factors the facts of the above case of mario tauvoli supra were similar to the present case before this court the learned state counsel submitted that rehabilitation was one of the key considerations in sentencing but it has to be weighed against the other circumstances that are present in the case in the present case the petitioner was a grown adult with responsibilities to look after the child victim who was in his custody when returning from the school she was in his care and protection the petitioner forcefully took her to a kitchen in a nearby house and abused and raped her committing several unlawful and immoral sexual acts knowing that the child victim was of tender years at the time of committing the sexual acts the victim cried out but the petitioner continued to keep on committing the offence plundering the victim s very childhood the state counsel further submitted that rape and sexual statistics of fiji disclose equally worrying social malaise and further submitted that the statistics released by the director of public prosecutions reveals that between january and july 2018 out of 123 cases of rape and sexual violence filed in 78 cases the victims were children and out of 78 cases 26 victims were aged 10 years and below state counsel further submitted that the sentence of 13 years 7 months and 15 days is commensurate with the serious offence he committed and moved for dismissal of the petitioner s appeal i agree with her submission that the sentence of 13 years 7 months and 15 days is commensurate with the serious offence of rape the petitioner committed it is relevant at this juncture to refer to the observations expressed by his lordship the chief justice anthony gates in ram v state 2015 fjsc 26 cav12 2015 DATE the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the courts have recently been handing down very heavy sentences on offenders against children sexual offending against children in this country has become far too prevalent and it is the hope that harsh sentences will send out a clear message to would be perpetrators that our children are to be protected from such unrestrained immorality according to the statistics released by the director of public prosecutions office it appears that a number of rape victims as well as victims under the age of 18 years and victims in domestic relationships or relatives were also victims of other serious sexual offences the rape of children is a very serious offence and it is very frequent and prevalent in fiji the courts must impose harsh penalties dictated by the legislation the courts should not leniently look at this kind of serious cases of rape of children of tender years when punishing the offenders in view of the seriousness gravity and cruelty involved in this case when committing the offence of rape of the victim child of 7 years the sentence imposed by the high court is justifiable and commensurate with the offence in fact the petitioner is fortunate that he was not sentenced to a more harsh term of imprisonment in terms of sentencing practice of our courts we do not find any reasons to observe that the court of appeal has fallen into error when it reached its conclusion to dismiss the petitioner s appeal conclusion in the backdrop of the legal position stated above it is clear that the petitioner has not been able to establish any ground of appeal before this court the prosecution in the trial court relied not only on the caution interview statement of the petitioner but also on the victim s evidence john davis s evidence and medical evidence therefore the petitioner s application for leave should fail the petitioner has failed to satisfy any of the threshold criteria enumerated in section 7 2 of the supreme court act of 1998 therefore for the reasons set out above the petitioner s application for leave to appeal should be refused and we dismiss the said application 65 orders of the court 1 the petitioner s application for leave to appeal is

fijian lady she continued her relationship with the convict miss p n worked as the proprietress of a hair salon 4 on the DATE this accused went to the salon and waiting until all customers had left he closed the door and demanded of miss p n why she was seeing another man and he started to beat her with a pinch bar apart from beating miss p n he damaged the wall mirror inside the salon with the pinch bar 5 miss p n yelled for help when upon passers by intervened and the accused was arrested and miss p n was rushed to hospital 6 the accused was interviewed under caution when he told the police that the previous evening he had been watching the ladies flat and had become suspicious of persons he had seen there it was then that he formulated the plan to take matters in hand the following day 7 the accused had on 20th october been made subject to a domestic violence restraining order however he was not charged with breach of this order by committing these offences 8 miss p n was medically examined and found to have quite serious injuries including cut wounds to her eyebrow and lower legs and multiple haematomae on the face shoulder and legs 9 the accused tells me he is 35 years old that he works as a building contractor and has been educated to class 7 level he expresses sincere remorse and tells me he will try to reconcile with miss p n if she is willing 10 the domestic violence decree 2009 is applicable to all parties who are or have been in a domestic relationship and the decree quite obviously is germane in this case i regard the breach of a prior restraining order against this accused as a very serious matter indeed 11 when a relationship sours it is the right of each party to lead his her life unfettered by any influence of the other party whether miss p n was entertaining a new suitor or whether this was merely a misconception on the part of the accused does not matter it must be a basic human right to consort lawfully with whomever one wants to and not to be prey to the resentful whim of a spurned partner 12 the maximum penalty for the offence of act with intent to cause grievous harm is imprisonment for life this is an offence relatively new to the jurisdiction introduced by the crimes decree 2009 on DATE until a body of sentencing authorities is secured it is helpful to rely on the analogous section 224 of the old penal code the offence of an act intended to cause grievous harm it was established in viliame cavubati haa 80 of 2001 by shameem j that the accepted tariff for this offence should range from a suspended sentence through to 2 ½ years this court said in amasi korovata hac 11 of 2009 that the range now should extend up to 4 to 5 years 13 this offence was particularly repugnant in that the victim was the accuseds long time girl friend and that the attack was vicious and in her place of work i take as a starting point a term of two years imprisonment the aggravating features to be considered are i there was no provocation on the part of the victim ii she was unarmed iii the attack was on the victims workplace where she had an expectation to be safe for these features i add another two years to the sentence bringing it to a total of 4 years 14 although the accused was not charged with a breach of domestic violence restraining order he has admitted before me that he in fact did so which i regard as another aggravating feature for that breach i add a further 12 months imprisonment bringing the interim total term to 5 years 15 of course the greatest item of mitigation in the accuseds favour is his plea of guilty and he is to have full credit for this i deduct from his sentence a full third of 20 months for that plea i deduct a further period of 4 months for his remorse which means that this accused will serve a total term for the unlawful act of three years he will serve two years of that term before being eligible for parole 16 for the offence of damaging property i sentence the accused to a term of 9 months to be served concurrently with the unlawful act sentence 17 in view of the imminent term of incarceration any order under the domestic violence decree would be

and i say it again that our prisons are already too full of young fijian men and the courts have a duty to try and reverse that trend wherever it is possible and just in other words every effort must be made to keep young first offenders out of prison even i might add at the risk of being lenient needless to say in the case of young first offenders there can rarely ever be any conflict between the general public interest and that of the offender if i may say so society has no greater interest than that its young people should became useful law abiding citizens and the difficult task of the courts is to determine what punishment or treatment gives the best chance of achieving that end the realisation of that objective is the primary and by far the most important consideration in sentencing young first offenders emphasize is mine 12 in state v t v k 2011 fjhc 732 hac014 2011 DATE justice thurairaja imposed for the juveniles in that case to be kept under probation until they

77302,judgment on DATE the appellant was convicted on his own plea of guilty by the suva magistrate s court of the offence of attempted rape and sentenced to three years imprisonment statement of offence attempted rape contrary to section 151 of the penal code act 17 particulars of offence nemani kaverevere alias nemani bulivuarua kaverevere between the DATE and DATE at lami in the central division attempted to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a women namely the complainant without her consent the appellant in person appeals against the sentence and while it is difficult to make sense out of the filed grounds it appears that the grounds are 1 that the police conspired to charge him of attempted rape 2 that he was wrongly charged because his intention was only to break into complainant s house it was alleged by the prosecution in the outline of facts that between 10 00 p m of DATE to 1 00 a m on DATE complainant who is 45 years old was alone at her flat at lami she heard a dog barking so she opened her door to check as soon as she opened her door the appellant rushed in with a kitchen knife and put it on her neck he demanded for money and as she had no money she gave her wedding ring and watch to the appellant the accused saw that the complainant was wearing her nightclothes so he pushed her on the bed and lay on top of her he tried to have sexual intercourse with her but could not penetrate as he could not get an erection he licked complainant s private parts and fondled her breasts and again unsuccessfully tried to have sex the complainant reported matter to police except for the fact that he was carrying a knife the appellant admitted other facts which the learned chief magistrate ruled were quite sufficient to prove attempted rape in mitigation the appellant inter alia said i was drunk at the time i used to drink near complainant s house i went past the complainant s room the light was on she was naked i was tempted there cannot be a clearer case of unequivocal plea of guilty than this and really this appeal should not be allowed in terms of section 309 of the criminal procedure code i could have disposed of the matter here however since the appellant was not represented i will briefly consider his argument that there was no attempt to rape his intention was only to break into the house the word attempt is defined in section 380 of the penal code as follows where a person intending to commit an offence begins to put his intentions into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment and manifests his intention by some overt act but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence he is deemed to attempt to commit the offence it is immaterial except so far as regards punishment whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention it is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to the offender it is impossible in fact to commit the offence the intent of accused is same in rape as in attempted rape that intent is to have sexual intercourse together with knowledge or recklessness as to the absence of consent r v khan 1990 2 all e r 783 in the present case there were a number of overt acts which went beyond the mere preparatory stage and which show that he had begun to execute his intention these are that the appellant had 1 pushed the complainant onto a bed 2 he lay on top of her 3 he tried to have sex with her but could not as he could not get an erection 4 he licked her private parts and fondled her breasts 5 he again lay on top of her to have sex in short he tried to have sex twice but failed to penetrate in epironi levukaiciwa others v the state crim appeal haa0087 of 2001 unreported judgment of justice nazhat shameem the accused lay on top of the complainant to have sex he still had his clothes on and when the complainant pleaded with him he stopped and did not take his clothes off in dealing with this issue of attempt she commented section 380 makes it clear that a man is guilty of an attempted rape when with the intention to rape he does an overt act and the fact that he changed his mind or he was prevented from completing the offence by independent circumstances is irrelevant to his conviction in the present case there are a series of admitted overt acts as stated above on the basis of which the learned magistrate was quite correct in convicting the appellant of attempted rape the appellant also complains of severity of sentence he says three years is excessive sentence the only mitigating factor is the guilty plea thereby saving court s time there are a number of aggravating features to this case there was violence used by the appellant the injuries may not be serious but they are multiple as shown by the medical report there were abrasions on the right and left side of lower jaw abrasion on left hand and under the wedding ring abrasions on the left thigh and right thigh there were two attempts to rape the complainant is aged 45 and was alone at home and therefore vulnerable the incident occurred at night inside complainant s house the appellant had forced himself into the privacy of complainant s home and subjected her to indignities in her own home the appellant has a string of previous convictions since 1996 he is an annual visitor to the courts and not a first offender the learned magistrate in his sentencing approach looked at the maximum penalty considered the starting point of five years looked at the mitigating factors and sentenced the accused to three years imprisonment this was a very serious case of attempted rape and the sentence of three years imprisonment was quite proper and may have been a bit lenient appeal against

during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole the only exception where a court can refrain from fixing a non parole period when sentencing an offender for an imprisonment term of two years or more is provided under section 18 2 of the sentencing and penalties decree in terms of the said subsection a court can decide not to fix a non parole period when sentencing an offender for a term of two years or above if the court considers that it is not appropriate to fix a non parole period given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender according to the plain reading the said section is applicable where a court considers that an offender should not be released on parole early and should serve the full sentence given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender therefore i am of the view that section 18 2 of the sentencing and penalties decree cannot be applied in order to refrain from fixing a non parole period considering the circumstances of this case i order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 08 years of your sentence in terms of section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree you have

also over the left cerebrum partially collapsed lungs bilaterally extensive scalp haematomas and haemorrhages and it reports the cause of death as being sub dural haematomas and sub arachnoid haemorrhages consistent with heavy blows to the head at around 1 00pm you went to call the deceased to have lunch but she did not respond to your calls you left the deceased and joined your other friends to have lunch at around 4 30pm you told your friends that the deceased was still not responding to your calls you then on the advice of your friends took the deceased to the nadi hospital you and your friends then arranged for a transport upon arriving at the hospital she was taken to the emergency department where she was pronounced dead you were subsequently arrested and interviewed and you admitted punching the deceased you were born on the DATE you were 28 years of age at the time the offence was committed and you are now 30 years of age you attended barotu indian school from classes 1 to 8 at the rakiraki public school until 1991 in 1994 to 1999 you were employed as a guardman with guard force and later in 2000 you obtained employment as a garment worker in namaka you are currently employed as a labourer at san bruno hotel in nadi you are described as having co operated with the police in the course of their investigation whilst you have three prior convictions dating back to 1996 two of those three convictions are subsequent to the commission of this offence certainly unrelated behaviour you told the court by your counsel that you have a relationship with your daughter that you have reconciled with the deceased s parents and that they take care of your daughter and i am urged by your counsel to impose upon you a non custodial sentence or at least a sentence of less than 3 years the fiji court of appeal considered the difficulty in determining an appropriate punishment for manslaughter in kim nam bae v the state cr app no aau0015 of 1998s the court in that case said the task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculation this particularly so with manslaughter where the circumstances and the offender s culpability can vary greatly from case to case an appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations in order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case the courts must have regard to sentences imposed by the high court and the court of appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence the cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal it is important to bear in mind that this range covers a very wide set of varying circumstances which attract different sentences in different manslaughter cases each case will attract the appropriate sentence within the range depending on its own facts it is suggested that there would be some provocation in this case and that you were provoked by your wife when she questioned you when you returned home at 6 00am i find such provocation to be minimal in sashi kapoor rayan v the state cr app no aau0028 of 2000s the court there noted that sentences for manslaughter of a serious case range from 7 to 10 years and of a less serious type fall into a midrange which i take to be 3 to 6 years and of course even less serious in low range below 3 years i have been referred to state v mosese waqasaqa rawaqa cr case no hac0007 of 2001s where madam justice shameem imposed a sentence of 9 years imprisonment after trial for a death resulting from a domestic situation and what her ladyship described as a situation where the accused had beaten the deceased to death i am also referred to state v anand dinesh mani anor cr case no hac0005 of 2000s a further decision of madam justice shameem her ladyship imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years on the accused who was convicted after trial where the circumstances involving the death of the deceased included the use of the knife in passing sentence her ladyship noted although i did not put this case into a category of minimal provocation with gross violence nor do i consider the case of grave provocation with minimum violence i take from the words used that it was seen by her ladyship as a midrange type of case in addition counsel for the accused refers the court the decision of mr justice govind a term of imprisonment of 18 months was imposed upon an accused after trial where the deceased died of drowning in a shallow creek after being punched twice by the accused again a death arising from a domestic situation the state refers the court to the state v salesh virendra kumar cr case no hac0004 of 2004 mr justice govind sentenced the accused to 2 ½ years imprisonment where the accused was convicted on a plea of guilty again for a death resulting from a domestic situation the incidence of domestic violence offences in this country seems constantly high with an unacceptable level of its acceptance of violence thereto and its incumbent on the court to clearly show that such behaviour is not acceptable in any community in this country state counsel urges that a starting point of 4 ½ years is inappropriate with that i concur however i am of the opinion that a significant discount is to be given to the accused by virtue of his early plea of guilty notwithstanding that the offences were committed some 1 year and 10 months ago the state on the DATE filed an information with respect to manslaughter and immediately a plea of guilty was entered it is appropriate for a discount of one third to be given for an early plea of guilty and in my opinion the accused is entitled to the total of this discount in doing so i reiterate as i said at the outset or more particularly what was said by the court of appeal in kim nam bae that the task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculation and nor should it be however giving you what the law might consider the maximum discount for the early plea of guilty i come to a resultant sentence of 3 years imprisonment and accordingly you are sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years john connors judge at

years the tariff is 7 years to 15 years 4 in mohamed kasim v the state unreported fiji court of appeal cr case no 14 of 1993 DATE the court of appeal observed we consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 1 the tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 15 years 2 in state v mario tauvoli 2011 fjhc 216 hac 027 2011 his lordship mr paul madigan held that rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in fiji at the time the legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect societys abhorrence for such crimes our nations children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound in this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter 1 in state v anthony 2012 fjhc 1013 hac 151 2010 his lordship mr priynatha nawana held that the accuseds engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent this kind of immoral act on a little girl of mbs standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists the depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future and the men of the accuseds caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community in passing down the sentence in case of this nature deterrence is therefore of paramount importance 1 considering the above i commence your sentence at 13 years imprisonment for the charge of rape 2 aggravating factors a the victim was of a younger and tender age b victim was subjected to more than one sexual act c you had made the victim sexually active at a young age d you had traumatized the life of the victim considering all i increase your sentence by 3 years now the sentence is 16 years imprisonment 1 for the guilty plea i deduct 3 years and now your

the following citation of d a thomas principles of sentencing 2nd edition 1979 p 56 57 which was cited in high court of australia judgment mill v the queen 1988 hca 70 the effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is just and appropriate the principle has been stated many times in various forms when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong when cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces it must look at the totality of the criminal behavior and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences 1 considering the totality principle i order the sentences of all two charges to run concurrently 2 further you are already serving a sentence of 11 years 7 months given to you on 29 11 2013 you have pleaded guilty to all the charges in five

outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 1 justice gates as he was then stated in state v marawa 2004 fjhc 338 that rape is the most serious sexual offence courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and meting out harsher sentences paragraph 10 1 in terms of section 208 of the crimes decree the maximum penalty for the offence of attempted rape is 10 years imprisonment justice shameem in the cases of jioji aunima v state haa 033 of 2010 and bulimaiwai v the state 2005 fjhc 261 haa 0068j 2005 s DATE had identified the tariff for the offence of attempted rape should be 12 months to 05 years imprisonment 2 after a careful consideration of the legal background on sentencing for the offences of rape and attempted rape i now turn to identify the aggravating and mitigating grounds in this particular instance the learned state counsel submitted a comprehensive sentencing submission along with the victim impact assessment report the learned counsel for the defense filed pertinent submissions in mitigation the victim impact assessment report clearly reflects that the emotional and psychological effects to the victim over the alleged sexual acts are enormous it says that after these incidents the victim is at a loss and always day dreaming at the home and in the class she does not perform in the school the most alarming portion in the report is that when she looks at older people she is afraid she is frightened to be alone in class 3 the huge disparity in ages between you and the victim in all means aggravates the background of offending the victim was just six years of age at the time of the commission of the offence whilst you were 71 years old the age gap was 65 years this fact alone is not reconcilable or compensated in any way your children must be having their own children older than the victim on the other hand your conduct amounts to a serious breach of trust you were an elderly person almost like the grandfather of the victim in the close vicinity of the victims native environment and should have been a role model to the younger generations instead you simply lured the small girl with some oranges the victim would not have come to your house anticipating this disastrous experience resulting her to be afraid of every old man comes across her entire life this background undoubtedly aggravates your offending 4 in mitigation you claim that you are 72 years of age and residing alone in tumavia nakelo tailevu after separated from your wife and three children in 1980 you are unemployed but engaged in subsistence farming you pleaded guilty to both the counts without going for a full trial saving the time and resources of the state and the court you had no intention to do such an act to the complainant nothing was pre planned and all happened in the spur of the moment you acknowledge that what you did was wrong and inexcusable you are sincerely remorseful and seek for forgiveness from court you admit that your action brought much embarrassment and humiliation to the family you promise not to reoffend and now engage evangelism work in the apostles church as a pioneer you have maintained a crime free record for over a decade and had co operated with the police being truthful and honest of the allegation you seek forgiveness from court and an opportunity to reform and rehabilitate you have been in remand custody for one week since DATE in relation to this case finally you are seeking for leniency as you are not a habitual offender and a longer custodial sentence would not serve justice 5 having considered the legal and factual background i take a starting point of 12 years imprisonment for the charge of rape i add 06 years for all the aggravating factors stated in paragraph 11 this court is of the view that this is a fit and proper instance to award you a deduction of a full third for your early plea of guilty as it indicates the true colors of remorse further this court thinks fit to deduct another 2 years from the interim period for all the other mitigating factors averred in paragraph 12 inclusive of your previous good character for over a decade and the one week incarceration your final sentence for the count of rape is 10 years imprisonment 6 it has been well established that the courts will often look into the higher end of the tariff when there is a serious breach of trust or the age gap between the offender and the victim is considerably high therefore in this instance i take a starting point of 04 years imprisonment for the offence of attempted rape i add 02 years imprisonment for all the aggravating factors mentioned earlier and deduct 1 year for all the mitigating factors it has to be borne in mind that though the charge remains as attempted rape you were almost there in achieving the target your final sentence for the offence of attempted rape is 05 years imprisonment 7 your final sentences stand as follows count no 1 attempted rape 05 years imprisonment count no 2 rape 10 years imprisonment 1 having considered the concepts of totality principle it is hereby ordered that the sentence for the 01st count of attempted rape be served concurrently with the sentence for the 02nd count of rape thus your final sentence is 10 years imprisonment 2 it is at this juncture this court has to decide whether to proceed ahead with the final sentence of 10 years imprisonment or to grant some concession to you because of your elderly age in the case of ratu penioni rokota v the state 2002 fjhc 168 haa0068j 2002s DATE justice shameem cited the following paragraph from principles of sentencing of d a thomas 2nd ed at page 196 recognition of age as a mitigation factor does not mean that imprisonment should never be imposed on elderly offenders and the court has upheld sentences of imprisonment on men in their seventies it is however a long established principle that a sentence should normally be shortened so as to avoid the possibility that the offender will not live to be released 1 the case of wilkinson 14 11 74 3025 c 74 in thomas supra page 196 a 05 years imprisonment given to a 60 year old man for committing the offences of indecency over a period of several years with his grandnieces was reduced to 30 months and said though a substantial custodial sentence was inevitable the offender had a perfectly good record and the offences began when he became desperately lonely widower in nicholls 27 6 75 1233 b 75 in thomas supra page 196 a 10 year sentence ordered for committing the offences of buggery and gross indecency to a man of 62 years without previous convictions was reduced to 07 years in appeal saying that even though such a sentence is justified on facts the sentencer did not pay sufficient attention to the factor of age 2 a careful consideration of wilkinson and nicholls show that even though a considerable attention have to be paid to the age factor in sentencing an elderly person the final sentence has a bearing on the gravity of the offence as well the concept of avoiding the elderly persons to be sent to prison for longer periods though principally correct this court is of the view that such an approach should not attach a massage to the society that one can get rid of a substantive amount of his criminal responsibility due to the elderly age it is simply because that as it is quite understood the more one gets older with maturity the more he or she should bear the conviction of being a socially morally and legally responsible person therefore whilst endorsing the long standing principle of awarding short terms of sentences to elderly offenders this court stresses that whatever the sentence is to be granted to the accused person should reflect the actual gravity of the crime of which the accused is been charged with 3 this is an instance as stated above where a six year old girl is been victimized by the lust of a very elderly offender it is been stressed time and again that the future of a country or a nation is children thus children must have the right to freedom and especially to spend their childhood without any undue disturbances to its smooth functioning this court considers that the shocking and shameful sexual activities of this nature expose the small children to the much polluted adult world the egregiousness of the existing facts of this case and the brazen attitude of the accused towards a small girl will have to get prominence over the elderly age of the accused thus this court is of the view that there is no need of being flexible with the tariff to accommodate any special treatment to you or your elderly age you will receive an immediate custodial sentence 4 your final sentence stands as 10 years imprisonment you will not be eligible for parole for 06 years in determining the parole period this court seriously considered your age factor and thought it fit not to impose a

examined by doctor salma sahinaz khan at navua hospital after been sedated she had observed two lacerations at 3 oclock and 9 oclock positions on the hymen and a slight inflammation around the vaginal orifice the doctor opined that ms a rs hymen was not intact and that is most likely due to a blunt force been inserted into her vagina 3 before proceeding to sentence you it was noted that the director of public prosecutions has not filed their sentencing submissions at the court registry on or before DATE and unfortunately up till today as ordered by this court on DATE i assume that the prosecution has nothing to submit to court on your sentence the only impediment occurs with this non co operation is the absence of the victim impact report yet for all the impact on a small girl of four years 4 after this kind of tragic experience is quite understood therefore whilst been deeply concerned about the non compliance of the courts directives by the prosecution i will now proceed to finalize your sentence 4 in terms of section 207 2 b if a person penetrates the vulva vagina or anus of another person to any extent with a thing or a part of his body other than the penis without consent that also amounts to the offence of rape it is in that context insertion of your finger to ms a rs vagina amounted to rape there is no issue of consent in this instance as ms a r being less than ten years 10 old is not capable of giving consent to perform any sexual act 5 the maximum sentence for the offence of rape is life imprisonment the tariff ranges from 10 15 years imprisonment

years old and your son is 8 years old your family is depended on you 3 the incident occurred on DATE in salia village nayau lau you had an argument with your wife regarding her whereabouts the previous night you accused her of drinking with the youths instead of attending an event for the women in the village she kept quiet because she was scared of you when she did not respond to your questions you beat her in the legs back and shoulders with the stick several times when she went inside the house you followed her and gave her more beatings until the stick broke the violence continued you punched her in the head and then tried to strangle her by pressing her neck with your bare hands she kicked you hard when she started to choke you fell backwards for a moment she thought that the violence had stopped but you continued with the use of violence on her after she did not respond to your accusations you picked up the broken stick and gave her more beatings until she lost consciousness when she regained consciousness you were not at the scene the victim found her daughter beside her crying she got up and walked to the health centre accompanied by the village nurse 4

family violence the primary purpose of the sentence is deterrence both special and general the courts have a duty to protect women and children from all forms of violence rehabilitation is relevant if the offender has taken responsibility for his crime and has addressed or has offered to address his violent behaviour 8 in her victim impact statement your wife has said i feel sorry for my husband and i have forgiven him i admitted that due to my action that made my husband assault me my children want him to come back home and we miss him 9 the court has also received a counselling report on the victim according to the counsellor the victim is traumatized by the assault inflicted on her by her husband the victim trusted her husband but she fears that she may be victimized again however she blames herself for her predicament because her husband s family has showed little empathy to her following his arrest 10 i am mindful of the wishes of the victim to continue with her relationship with her husband but i am cautious in placing too much weight on her wish the elephant in the room is the family violence without removing the elephant the sanctity of marriage and family cannot be restored violence will continue and the victim is exposed to further physical and psychological harm the power imbalance between you and the victim as in other similar cases of family violence is obvious the victims who mostly are women are forced to reconcile and live in violent relationships because of cultural barriers and lack of support financial and emotional 11 since you are in custody on remand little assistance is available to you to address your violent behaviour but i am satisfied that if you are offered rehabilitative programmes for gender based violence you will make an attempt to reform your behaviour you have expressed genuine remorse by confessing your crime to police and by entering an early guilty plea court time and resources have been saved by your early guilty plea you are also a person with previous good character for all these mitigating factors i give you a reduction in sentence by one year 12 i now consider the aggravating factors you breached the trust of your wife by inflicting physical violence on her you had exposed one of your children to violence who was found in a distressed condition after your wife regained her consciousness a weapon was used to inflict the violence resulting in physical injuries manual strangulation resulting in choking was a dangerous act the beatings were prolonged to a point the victim lost consciousness 13 these are some grave aggravating factors that justify a jail sentence to denounce family violence and deter you and others from committing family violence finally i am mindful of the proportionality principle that is your punishment must fit the crime you committed 14 taking all these factors into account i sentence you to 18 months imprisonment suspension is inappropriate you have already served about 4 months in custody on remand the remaining term you will have to serve is 14 months imprisonment 15 a permanent dvro with standard non molestation conditions is issued for

you for the said offence facts in this case 4 on DATE you returned home in your van the complainant your wife asked whether if you had gone to suva in the van but you denied that after a while you grabbed the complainant and assaulted her causing the injuries as per the medical report 5 you admitted the above facts 6 the medical report was tendered and the doctor found that the complainant got bruises in her left arm and lower body the law and the tariff for assault occasioning actual bodily harm 7 the sec 275 says maximum penalty for the offence is 05 years imprisonment 8 his lordship justice goundar held out that the tariff for assault occasioning actual harm ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault sereka v state 2008 fjhc 88 ham 027 aggravating factors 7 this is a domestic violence the complainant is your wife also you assaulted her without any provocation mitigating factors 9 i consider following points as mitigating factors in this case i married with children ii seeks forgiveness iii reconciled with the complainant 10 you informed the court that you have reconciled with the complainant the complainant was present and confirmed that 11 in a normal scenario these kinds of offences can be reconciled under sec 154 of the criminal procedure decree 154 1 in the case of any charge for an offence of common assault or assault occasioning actual bodily harm or criminal trespass or damaging property the court may in such cases which are a substantially of a personal or private nature and b not aggravated in degree promote reconciliation and encourage the settlement of the proceedings in an amicable way on terms of payment of compensation or on other term approved by the court which may involve i the giving of an apology in any appropriate manner ii the giving of a promise or undertaking not to re offend or to respect the rights and interests of any victim iii mandatory attendance at any counseling or other program aimed at rehabilitation or iv a promise or undertaking to alter any habits or conduct such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs 2 a court shall only proceed in accordance with sub section 1 if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner and the court shall ensure that the victim of the violence does not submit to any proceedings being undertaken in accordance with this section by reason of pressure being exerted in any form 3 upon proceeding in accordance with this section the court may then a order the proceedings to be stayed for a specified period of time upon the offender entering into any bond to comply with the terms imposed by the court under sub section 1 or b dismiss the proceedings 12 but sec 154 6 of the criminal procedure decree clearly says that this sec does not apply to domestic violence offences therefore even though you have reconciled i am not going to act under sec 154 3 of the criminal procedure decree 13 but the reconciliation has been taken as a mitigating factor in this case 14 now i will decide suitable starting point for your sentence after considering the facts in this case and tariffs i take 06 months as your staring point 15 for the aggravating factors i increase the sentence by 03 months now your sentence stands for 09 months imprisonment 16 since you have pleaded guilty in the first available instance you are entitled for a reduction of 1 3 of the total period of imprisonment akili vilimone v state there by your sentence stands for 06 months 17 i reduce further 02 months for other mitigating factors to reach the period of 04 months 18 in pursuant to section 26 2 b of the sentencing and penalties decree i am mindful that a sentence which is below two years could be suspended by this court 19 you are not a first offender but i note that your last conviction was in 2007 20 also i take in to my consideration sec 15 3 of the sentencing and penalties decree as a general principle of sentencing a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4 and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this part emphasis mine 21 therefore i believe you should be given a final chance to rehabilitate away from a custodial sentence accordingly i sentence you to 04 months imprisonment and suspend that for 02 years 22 if you commit any crime during that 02 years and found to be guilty by a court you have to serve this prison sentence 23 now i will turn my attention to the complainant in this case the domestic violence decree of 2009 has specific provisions for these situations section 24 a b i of the decree provides a subject to subsection 3 but not withstanding any other provision in this decree b where a person i pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence which is a domestic violence offence ii the court must make a domestic violence restraining order under this decree for the safety and well being of the person against whom the offence or alleged offence was committed iii where subsection 1 applies the court need not make an order under this section if satisfied that having regard to the safety and wellbeing of the person for whose protection the order would be made the order is not required 24 considering the summary of facts in this case i believe i should act under sec 24 of the domestic violence decree of 2009 25 therefore i also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non molestation conditions in favor of the complainant

took off her clothes and had sexual intercourse with her on the DATE the matter was reported to the police and the victim was medically examined the accused when questioned admitted the offence he admitted having sexual intercourse and admitted knowing at the time of the commission of the offence that the victim was under 16 years of age the medical report indicated that the victim s hymen was perforated and that she was sexually active in 2003 the appellant who was a carrier driver transported the victim to school when she was in class 8 in primary school the appellant admitted these facts after the learned magistrate again made him aware of the provisions of section 156 1 and the possible defence the learned magistrate asked a series of questions of the appellant court before i ask you whether you admit facts or not i would like to refer to few matters firstly you are made aware of s 156 1 a proviso of penal code it is a possible defence if you as accused had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the victim was over the age of 16 years accused i knew she was under 16 years of age i took her to school in primary school and children under 16 years go to primary school generally court i ask you did you know for sure that she was under 16 years accused yes court absolutely sure accused yes her father is my best friend and i know pritika as primary school child court i am prepared to adjourn the case to get her birth certificate if you need it and if you feel she is over 16 years accused no need i knew she is about 14 or so not 16 yet court do you admit facts as outlined by prosecution regarding you defiling her as alleged accused yes i do i loved her and wanted her to be my second wife before she even went to high school appeal against conviction on behalf of the appellant it is submitted that the provisions of section 309 of the criminal procedure code enable the appeal to proceed this section permits an appeal against conviction only where the legality of the sentence is in issue the prior section in similar terms was considered by grant cj in peni rakorako v r cr appeal no 85 of 1978 where with reliance on r v gyan deo 22 flr 1 where he found that the section presupposes that 1 the offence is one known to law 2 the admitted facts substantiate the offence 3 the accused understood the charge 4 the accused unequivocally admits his guilt the offence is known to law the accused admitted having sexual intercourse with the victim and admitted knowing that she was at that time under 16 years of age the learned magistrate indicated a preparedness to adjourn the proceedings to enable a birth certificate with respect to the accused to be produced it is apparent from the above quoted record the appellant declined as he knew her to be under 16 he transported her to school in year 8 primary school her father was his best friend and told him her age counsel for the appellant urges that the caution interview shows that the appellant did not know that the accused was under 16 years of age clearly from the answers given to the police officer this was not so at the time of the commission of the offence with which he was charged it is submitted by counsel for the appellant that the prosecution even where the offence is admitted must prove the age of the victim and must prove that penetration took place the authorities relied on do not support this proposition but merely support the obvious that hearsay evidence of these elements is not sufficient to prove them counsel for the appellant argues that by virtue of ananaia naqaqa ors v state hbm0014 of 2000l that the learned magistrate erred in failing to invite the prosecution to disclose to the court the contents of the record of interview the record of interview was tendered to the court on the appeal it does no more than clearly confirm that the appellant was aware that the victim was under the age of 16 at the time of the offence with which he was charged was committed the appellant had knowledge of the age of the accused the plea of guilty in the circumstances is unequivocal the appeal as to conviction must fail appeal against sentence the maximum sentence for this offence is 10 years penal code penalties amendment act 2003 winter j considered the relevant authorities in etonia rokowaqa v state cr appeal no haa0037 of 2004 he there concluded that since the increase of the maximum sentence to 10 years the starting point for this offence is 4 years with this i agree the appellant is entitled to a discount for his immediate plea of guilty which would reduce the sentence to 2 ½ years the appellant had no prior convictions warranting a further reduction in sentence to 2 years the aggravating factors are that 1 the accused is 30 years of age and the victim 15 years of age 2 the accused is married with 3 children 3 the accused was a carrier driver driving the victim to school and therefore in a position of trust a sentence of 3 years therefore seems appropriate in the circumstances and the sentence of 5 years imposed by the learned magistrate is excessive orders 1 appeal against conviction dismissed 2 appeal against

one count of sexual assault and two counts of rape he was sentenced to a total term of 16 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 15 years 2 the appeal is governed by section 21 1 of the court of appeal act cap 12 under this section the appellant is required to obtain leave to appeal on any ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact or fact alone section 35 1 of the court of appeal act cap 12 gives a single judge power to grant leave the test for leave to appeal against conviction is whether the appeal is arguable naisua v state unreported cr app no cav0010 of 2013 DATE leave is also required to appeal against sentence the test for leave to appeal against sentence is whether there is an arguable error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion naisua v state unreported cr app no cav0010 of 2013 DATE on any question of law alone the appellant may appeal as of right section 21 1 a 3 the grounds of appeal are appeal against conviction ground 1 the learned trial judge erred in law to shift the burden of prove sic to the appellant to show that the confession was not voluntarily when he directed the assessors that i he admitted he first appeared in the nausori magistrate sic court on 3 june he admitted he never complain of any improper police behaviour he also did not ask the magistrate for any medical examination for any injuries allegedly made by police ground 2 the learned trial judge erred in law when he failed to give a written ruling after the completion of the trial within trial before the principal trial ground 3 the learned trial judge erred in law ruling the confession statement as admissible in voir dire without providing any analysing of the evidence to demonstrate how he reached to such a conclusion ground 4 the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact to convict the appellant for the offence of rape in absence of any medical evidence to prove penetration compromising his right to fair trial appeal against sentence ground 5 the sentence is harsh and excessive in all circumstances of the matter ground 6 the learned trial judge erred in law to consider breach of trust as an aggravating factor in absence of any evidence to show that there was a relationship of trust between the appellant and the victim of alleged crime 4 at trial the appellant waived his right to counsel and chose to represent himself the victim was a 49 year old married woman with grown up children on the night in question she was home alone her husband was away at around 9 pm she was confronted with an intruder inside her bedroom the bedroom lights were switched off the intruder was masked the intruder threatened the victim with a cane knife she was gagged her hands and legs were tied with a piece of cloth and with a tape she was blindfolded with a piece of cloth which was taped to her face her clothes were removed she was subjected to various sexual assaults including digital and penile rape the intruder ejaculated inside her during penile rape she was left gagged after the intruder left 5 the appellant lived in the same neighbourhood as the victim the victim s husband gave evidence that when he was leaving his home on the night of the incident he met the appellant and told him that he was going to nakasi and his wife was home alone when the appellant was arrested he admitted the offences under caution at trial the appellant challenged the admissibility of his confession on the ground that it was extracted from him using force and unfair tactics the trial judge ruled the confession admissible in a voir dire ruling the appellant gave evidence he denied committing the alleged offences the assessors gave opinions that the appellant was guilty the trial judge agreed and convicted the appellant burden of proof 6 the appellant s contention that the learned trial judge shifted the burden of proof on the appellant to show that the confession was not made voluntarily has no merit in paragraph 4 of the summing up the learned trial told the assessors that as a matter of law the onus or burden of proof rest on the prosecution throughout the trial and it never shifts to the accused there is no obligation on the accused to prove his innocence under our system of criminal justice an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty 7 the trial judge reminded the assessors of the burden of proof at the end of the summing up in paragraph 30 remember the burden to prove the accuseds guilt beyond reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and it never shifts to the accused at any stage of the trial the accused is not required to prove his innocence or prove anything at all in fact he is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt in my judgment the direction on the burden of proof is impeccable there is no basis to conclude that the trial judge gave an impression that the appellant was required to prove that he made his confession involuntarily ground one is unarguable lack of detailed reasons for the voir dire ruling 8 the trial judge held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the appellant s confession after hearing the evidence on the voir dire the learned judge ruled the confession admissible on DATE and proceeded with the trial he gave written reasons for his decision on DATE the date the sentence was delivered and the case was concluded counsel for the appellant submits that the practice of admitting the disputed confession into evidence after a voir dire and giving reasons later during the trial was irregular this court is not aware of any authority that says that such a practice is irregular ground two is unarguable 9 the trial judge s written reasons were brief after referring to the relevant principles the trial judge came to the following conclusion i have heard all the evidence i accept the prosecutions witnesses evidence as credible i accept what they said i rule that the accuseds caution interview statements and charge statements are admissible evidence and their acceptance or otherwise will be a matter for the assessors 10 the appellant s contention is that the trial judge had not analyzed the evidence in the voir dire ruling central to the issue of admissibility was the credibility of the appellant and the police officers the police officers denied using force or unfair tactics to extract the confession from the appellant the appellant s evidence was that they did the trial judge believed the police officers and ruled the appellant s confession admissible the trial judge was indeed economical with his reasons i do not think he made an error by being economical with his reasons such a course was approved by the court of appeal in ganga ram v r 46 of 1983 where it said accordingly we wish to say that it has always been thought desirable that findings adverse to an accused person if they must be pronounced during the course of a trial should be as economically worded as possible 11 further in deo v reginam 1984 fijilawrp 4 1984 30 flr 31 DATE it was held that the learned trial judge was correct in his ruling on the admissibility of the confessions of doing so briefly without going into the details of the evidence similar pronouncement was made by the privy council in wallace and others v the queen jamaica 1996 ukpc 47 DATE for these reasons ground three is unarguable medical evidence 12 at trial the prosecution led no medical evidence but the medical report of the victim was disclosed to the appellant the appellant s contention that the medical evidence should have been led is devoid of merit this court has no jurisdiction to consider evidence that was not led at the trial ground four is unarguable breach of trust 13 the appellant s contention is that the trial judge was wrong to consider the breach of trust as an aggravating factor because the appellant was not related to the victim i accept that the victim was not related to the appellant but there was evidence that both lived in the same settlement and the appellant occasionally visited the victim s home to drink kava with her husband there was evidence of trust arising from the friendship between the appellant and the victim s husband and that trust was breached when the appellant raped his friend s wife whether the sentence is harsh and excessive 14 apart from the breach of trust there were many aggravating factors the victim was raped in the safety of her own home the incident happened at night time when the victim was alone and vulnerable the appellant was masked to hide his identity the victim was threatened with a cane knife the victim was gagged hands legs tied and taped face blindfolded and taped the appellant ejaculated inside the victim thus exposing the victim to pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases 15 in my judgment the sentence of 16 years imprisonment reflects the criminality involved there is no arguable

the supreme court under section 7 2 of the supreme court act of 1998 on the following grounds of appeal contained in a petition which was received in the registry of the supreme court on DATE i that the court of appeal erred in law in not properly addressing the grounds of appeal ii that the court appeal erred in law in holding that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice and thereby applying the provision to 23 of the court of appeal act despite earlier findings merits in the petitioner s grounds which relates to the paucity of directions on the recent complaint as per paragraph 16 and 25 of the impugned judgment iii that the court of appeal erred in law in wrongly purporting to overrule or not follow the recent supreme court ruling in praveen ram cav001 2011 and in particular the reasoning of the supreme court in suresh chandra v state cav 21 2015 where the court in that instance endorsed the principles in ram in view of the petitioner s initial complaint that the trial judge did not properly and or independently assess the evidence after the verdict of the assessors iv the court of appeal thereby erred in holding in paragraph 30 that ram must be read in a manner that is consistent with the provision of 237 of the cpd in light of the overriding provision in section 98 of 2013 constitution the supreme court sub section 7 binding on all other courts of the state however according to the appeal submissions filed by the petitioner dated DATE the main grounds of appeal can be limited to the following i the fiji court of appeal erred in law when it did not consider the issue of non direction on the inconsistent statement of the complainant during the trial and lack of direction on recent complaint evidence ii the petitioner alleges the lack of reasoning and independent evaluation of evidence by the learned trial judge after the verdict of the assessors were given it is relevant to consider the facts briefly in this case before dealing with the grounds of appeal of the petitioner background facts the female complainant was born on DATE she was the child of the petitioner s wife s younger sister she was the niece of the petitioner by marriage in december 2009 she lived with her relatives in nadi she was 15 and half years old at that time her parents were residing in the united states in january 2010 it was discovered that she was 4 5 months pregnant the petitioner and his wife offered to take her to village at kuku and look after her and her child the petitioner and his wife accordingly agreed to allow her to stay with them shortly after the petitioner s family returned to kuku village in tailevu with the victim in january 2010 she became a part of the family as soon as the victim arrived in the petitioner s house at kuku village the petitioner started to abuse her by fondling her breasts body and kissing her in the neck and mouth the petitioner repeatedly abused her on numerous occasions between january and may in 2010 the complainant alleged in her evidence further that the petitioner continued to rape her when the petitioner s wife and his daughter were away from the house the victim alleged in her evidence that the petitioner raped her on the previous day of the birth of the child and one week after the child s birth the petitioner continued to rape the complainant twice a week without her consent thereafter until she left the house in august 2011 as she was fed up and could not take it any further the victim stated that she told her aunty on at least two occasions but she did not believe what she told her it was revealed in the course of her evidence that she was treated like a house girl she also admitted under cross examination that she was hit by the petitioner with a stick according to the above facts and evidence elicited at the trial it must be stated that the offence of rape involved in this case is a serious one it is a worst form of sexual assault on the complainant the victim had to undergo the trauma for a long period of time during her stay in the petitioner s house in kuku village it is also important to refer to the agreed facts before considering the grounds of appeal the following facts were agreed on DATE by the prosecution and the defence in terms of section 135 of the criminal procedure decree no 43 of 2009 that the victim raijeili katarina was the accused s niece that the victim fell pregnant and came to live with the accused and his wife that the victim resided with the accused and his wife at their home in kuku village bau road during the time of the alleged offending that the victim resided with the accused family until giving birth it is pertinent to state that the agreed facts are admissions and they are sufficient proof of the facts admitted and there is no legal requirement to prove them grounds of appeal we will deal with the main grounds of appeal as stated in paragraph 8 above based on the submissions of the petitioner the main grounds of appeal on inconsistencies of statements and recent complaint issue as contained in the appeal submissions are dealt with based on the material and all the submissions made by both parties we observe that the court of appeal has carefully discussed the above grounds of appeal in paragraphs 13 14 and 15 of the judgment and reached the correct conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice or unfair trial inconsistencies of statement the contents in paragraph 14 is reproduced as follows 14 to the extent that there were inconsistencies in the complainant s evidence it must not be forgotten that at the time when the offences commenced the complainant was 15 and half years old and pregnant she had been offered and accepted accommodation during her confinement and following the birth of her son the trial was over two years later by which time the complainant had turned 18 it should not be surprising that her memory of the details of events that had occurred at a time when she was extremely vulnerable were inconsistent during the course of her evidence and cross examination her evidence on the elements of the offences were entirely consistent throughout the trial in my judgment there were no material inconsistencies in the complainant s evidence that would require comment by the learned judge in his summing up emphasis added we also observe that even though there are some inconsistencies in relation to the medical report when the complainant told the doctor that she was hit by the petitioner with a rope having previously claimed that she was hit with a stick the evidence of the complainant was consistent with the elements of the offences of rape and indecent assault with which the petitioner was charged however we find that the learned trial judge in his summing up at paragraphs 26 and 31 has correctly directed the assessors on the issue of credibility of the complainant as a witness paragraph 26 states as follows as assessors and judges of fact your decision in this case will largely depend on how you decided on the credibility of the complainant as against the accused as a witness in other words after observing the two give evidence from the witness box and watching their behavior and general demeanour in the court room and given your general experience as members of the community who do you find as more credible of the two witnesses your answer to this question will determine your answer to the questions posed in paragraph 8 hereof and in paragraph 31 the learned trial judge left it entirely to the assessors to decide whether or not to accept the complainant s evidence it is important to mention that there is no evidence or any indication that the complainant was cross examined on the issue of inconsistencies and in fact when this matter was heard court posed this question on the inconsistencies of statements of the complainant to the counsel who represented the petitioner and he admitted that the issue on inconsistency of statement was never raised in the trial court as such there does not appear to be any error on the part of the trial judge to give any direction to the assessors sudhakar v the state aau 105 of 2010 DATE it was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioner was represented by a counsel during the trial proper and none of the material inconsistencies were cross examined and challenged by the defending counsel if the witness was not cross examined on the inconsistencies the petitioner cannot raise that issue on appeal per lord morris in browne v dunn h l 1893 r 6 67 p recent complaint the petitioner has urged in the next ground of appeal that the learned judge failed to direct the assessors on belatedness of the complaint made to the police the reason for not making a timely complaint to the police was obvious the victim was treated like a house girl and she was under the direct control of the petitioner in the house she was only 15 and half years old the complainant immediately after leaving the petitioner s house duly complained to relatives in nadi and the police after the confinement the learned trial judge adequately addressed this issue in his summing up in jonkers v police 1996 67 sasr 401 matheson j observed the following on recent complaint the authorities establish that a complaint can be recent and admissible although it may not have been made at the first opportunity which presented itself what is the first reasonable opportunity will depend on the circumstances including the character of the complainant and relationship between the complainant and to whom she complained and the persons to whom she might have complained did not do so it is to be noted that the complainant in fact had told the neighbor ms vadei about what happened to her and that the petitioner was troubling her and the trial judge has referred to it in his summing up the neighbor ms vadei testified in court and confirmed that the victim was raped by the petitioner in paragraph 27 of the summing up at page 71 of the sc record learned trial judge directed the assessors as follows ms vadei said she lived in a home which was three footsteps away from the accused s family house in kuku village she said she knew the accused s family and the complainant well and she got on well with them she said she resided in kuku village from 2009 to 2011 she said the complainant normally shared things with her she recalled the complainant coming to her one day and complained that the accused s family was making her work hard she also said she was crying at the time and she told her that livai was touching her and having sex with her she said livai beat her and she was showing her bruises on her leg she said she cried with her as assessors and judges of fact you must consider this evidence carefully it does not prove truth of what the complainant alleged against the accused but it does tend to prove what was occupying the complainant s mind and her general demeanour at the time she confided in ms vadei it is evidence which you will have to consider with other evidence when you deliberate in the case it is the credibility of the complainant when giving evidence that has to be considered we conclude that the grounds of appeal on inconsistency of statement and on issue of recent complaint fail and should be refused due to lack of merit trial judge s failure to assess the evidence independently this ground of appeal is a fresh ground which was not raised in the court of appeal this court is not inclined to make any observations on this ground of appeal as the court of appeal did not have the opportunity to look into issue raised by the petitioner however we observe that the trial judge has given proper directions to the assessors on each aspect of evidence and the law in his summing up it can be seen from a line of authorities in fiji and other jurisdictions that the supreme court has been reluctant and have refused to excise its jurisdiction in allowing the new points to be taken up or to be argued in the apex court if the new point had not been argued in the court below as such we refuse and dismiss leave to appeal on this ground of appeal leave to appeal before supreme court the petitioner s application for leave to appeal is subject to the threshold criteria specifically contained in section 7 2 of the supreme court act no 14 of 1998 which reads as follows 2 in relation to a criminal matter the supreme court must not grant special leave to appeal unless a a question of general legal importance is involved b a substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved or c substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur in dip chand v state cav0014 20 DATE the supreme court observed as follows given that the criteria set out in section 7 2 of the supreme court act no 14 of 1998 are extremely stringent and special leave to appeal is not granted as a matter of course the fact that the majority of the grounds relied upon by the petitioner for special leave to appeal have not been raised in the court of appeal makes the task of the petitioner of crossing the threshold requirements for special leave even more difficult it is manifestly clear from the above provisions contained in the section 7 2 of the supreme court act special leave should not be granted as a matter of course the supreme court in aminiasi katonivualiku v state 2003 fjsc crim app no cav0001 1999s DATE clarified the jurisdiction of the supreme court at page 3 as follows it is plain from this provision that the supreme court is not a court of criminal appeal or general review nor is there an appeal to the court as a matter of right and whilst we accept in an application for special leave some elaboration on the grounds of appeal may have to be entertained the court is necessarily confined within the legal parameters set out above to an appeal against the judgment of the court of appeal which in this instance was an order for a new trial it is to be noted that the above passage in aminiasi case supra was cited with approval in subsequent supreme court decisions such as raura v the state 2006 fjsc 4 cav0010u 2005s DATE and chand v the state 2012 fjsc6 cav14 2010 DATE as stated above the stringent threshold criteria in section 7 of the supreme court has been discussed and decided in a series of cases in the supreme court of fiji see bulu v housing authority 2005 fjsc 1 cbv 0011 20 DATE it can be observed that from the above decisions that special leave is not granted unless the case is one involving a matter of public interest or some important question of law the extra ordinary power of the supreme court in fiji will be exercised under section 7 2 of the supreme court in its discretion only if the threshold criteria encapsulated therein is met by a petitioner notwithstanding the right of appeal granted to an aggrieved party to seek special leave chandra j i agree with the reasons and conclusions of his lordship hettige j conclusion in considering the facts and evidence and written submissions of both the petitioner and the state counsel in this case both in the trial court court of appeal and supreme court we do not find that the court of appeal had fallen into any error as alleged by the petitioner and there is no miscarriage of justice suffered by the petitioner we also do not find that the petitioner has sustained any substantial and grave injustice the petitioner has failed to satisfy the threshold requirements contemplated in section 7 2 of the supreme court act of 1998 and in the result the petitioner has failed to satisfy us on any of the grounds of appeal urged before this court and we reach the conclusion that the petitioner s application should be dismissed for the reasons set out above this court in exercising its extra ordinary power under section 98 3 of the constitution would not be justified in granting special leave to appeal in this case accordingly we make the following orders leave to

observed we consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 1 the tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 15 years 2 in state v mario tauvoli 2011 fjhc 216 hac 027 2011 hon mr justice paul madigan held that rape of

in state v anthony 2012 fjhc 1013 hac 151 2010 hon mr justice priynatha nawana held that the accuseds engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent this kind of immoral act on a little girl of mbs standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists the depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future and the men of the accuseds caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community in passing down the sentence in case of this nature deterrence is therefore of paramount importance 1 it was held further by hon mr justice priynatha nawana that the accused had not shown any remorse or repentance on the contrary he relentlessly castigated the witnesses saying that they were making up a false allegation at the expense of the little girl to avenge an unsubstantiated previous incident of refusing a loan to mbs mother this added in my view insult to the injury while court recognizes that the accused was entitled to advance any proposition in support of his case court equally recognizes that it should show its displeasure by showing no mercy in the matter of sentence when such allegations are found to be totally ill founded as in this case 1 considering the above i commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment for the charge of rape 2 aggravating factors a the victim was of a younger

listening to all the prosecution witnesses as well as the accused this court deliberated that mr pita tiqatabua is guilty of all 4 counts of attempted rape the detailed analysis of evidence is being reflected in the judgment pronounced in open court on DATE 2 the maximum penalty for the offence of attempted rape contrary to section 151 of the penal code and section 208 of the crimes decree attract a maximum period of 10 years imprisonment it was decided in jolame nokonokomoli v state haa 23 of 2009 that the tariff for the offence of attempted rape should be between 12 months to 5 years

imprisonment 3 keeping the legal precedents in mind i take a starting point of 42 months of imprisonment 3 ½ years for each count 4 it was revealed in the course of the hearing that the accused is a relative of the victim as the victim calls the accused grandfather both parties were living in the same settlement in close by barracks the accused was almost 40 years of age while the victim was 12 years at the time of the commission of the offence as the learned prosecutor correctly pointed out the conduct of the accused is a clear reflection of gross breach of trust where a civilized society would not anticipate such behaviour from a person with this age difference while being related to the victim it was quite evident that the accused was using his authority of age and relationship to get the control over the victim being 12 years of age it is obvious that the victim is so vulnerable at the same time i note that the alleged offences had continued for almost 1 year on four different occasions and that is a clear indication of as to how the accused maximized the opportunity of abusing the victim whenever the opportunity comes in his way until the accused and the victim were caught red handed by another child in close vicinity eparama the victim was kept in the dark and in fear not to divulge her bitter experiences to anybody because of the authority and the force of the accused adding salt to the injury it makes things worse when the sexual activities were tried to be compensated with some sun pops or a 1 00 coin or a packet of noodles the above stated factors will aggravate the background with which the accused is being charged with 5 in mitigation the following grounds were urged by the accused apologizes to court remorseful for his actions and deeds states that these offences were totally out of character remand centre has been a very salutary lesson and he is determined to lead a new life away from crime low level of violence used with no injuries to the victim though there were threats 6 accused is a security officer of 42 years of age he is married with 4 children and his schooling children and elderly parents are dependent on him it is rather interesting to note that though the accused who initially challenged the charges leveled against him and went for a full hearing had taken a topsy turvy by admitting himself in mitigation that he is remorseful for his actions and deeds the offences are totally out of character he learnt his lessons and determined to lead a crime free life paster leveni sovatavua of apostle church in nabua was also called on behalf of the accused to offer character evidence pastor testified to the effect that the accused was an honest man while he was working with him in church and he was surprised to hear about this case but he admitted that he knows the victim girl also and he has not come across any of her dishonest acts as well since the court has already decided to place its reliance on the victim girl upon listening to her testimony i am not going to take into consideration what the pastor said about the victim 7 for all the above stated aggravating factors i add 12 months imprisonment to the starting point having considered the mitigatory factors inclusive of the testimony of pastor leveni i reduce 6 months form the total you did not plead guilty to the charges without going for a hearing therefore you are not entitled to a reduction for an early guilty plea and on the other hand its an indication of the true colours of your remorse the outcome of that was the victim being still a small girl coming to the witness box and recalling all her bitter experiences 8 with the above mathematical arrangement your final sentence remains at 48 months imprisonment for each count as the case record reflects that you had been in remand at least since DATE to DATE in relation to this case and that is around 1 ½ months thus i order that 1 ½ months be reduced from your sentence of 4 years imprisonment for each count and therefore it will come down to 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks imprisonment 9 further i note that you have been in remand custody since DATE the day this court pronounced your conviction hence i order your sentence of 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks for each count to be commenced from DATE 10 finally i order the sentence of 3 years 10 months and 2 weeks for each count to

the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than the starting point 16 section 17 of the sentencing and penalties act states if an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them 17 i am satisfied that the two offences for which the accused stands convicted are offences founded on the same facts and are of similar character therefore taking into account section 17 of the sentencing and penalties act i prefer to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the two offences 18 it is the duty of the court to protect women from sexual violations of any kind that is the reason why the law makers have imposed life imprisonment for the offence of rape as the maximum penalty 19 bearing in mind the seriousness of the offences committed i take 9 years imprisonment as the starting point of your aggregate sentence i add 2 years for the aggravating factor bringing an interim total of 11 years imprisonment although the personal circumstances and family background of the accused has little mitigatory value however i find your good character has substantive mitigating value i therefore reduce the sentence by 2 years 20 i note the accused has been in remand for about 1 month and 18 days i exercise my discretion to further reduce the sentence for the remand period by 2 months in accordance with section 24 of the sentencing and penalties act as a period of imprisonment already served 21 under the aggregate sentencing regime of section 17 of the sentencing and penalties act the final sentence of imprisonment for the two offences of rape is 8 years and 10 months imprisonment 22 having considered section 4 1 of the sentencing and penalties act and the serious nature of the offences committed on the victim compels me to state that the purpose of this sentence is to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances of the case and to deter offenders and other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature 23 under section 18 1 of the sentencing and penalties act i impose 7 years as a non parole period to be served before the accused is eligible for parole i consider this non parole period to be appropriate in the rehabilitation of the accused which is just in the circumstances of this case 24 mr ragigia you have committed an abhorrent crime against a victim who trusted you in this case the victim was doing a good deed to your family in particular to your children by attending to household chores in the absence of your wife i am sure it will be difficult for the complainant to forget what you had done to her your actions towards the victim were deplorable and selfish this court will be failing in its duty if a deterrent custodial sentence was not imposed 25 i am satisfied that the term of 8 years and 10 months imprisonment does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each offence 26 in summary i pass an aggregate sentence of 8 years and 10 months imprisonment for the two offences of rape that the accused have been convicted of with a non parole period of 7 years to be served before the accused is eligible for parole 27 30 days to appeal to the court of appeal sunil sharma judge at lautoka DATE

penetrated the mouth of nasi vakacegu with his penis without her consent you pleaded guilty for all the above charges on DATE and you were convicted accordingly according to the summary of facts you are the stepfather of the victim who is 14 years old on the DATE while your wife and two children were attending a funeral in naivicula village you asked the victim who was staying at a pastors house at that time to come home with you you then called her to the bedroom you caressed her breasts and you forcefully undressed her you told her to bend down to the floor and you rubbed your penis against her body you then punched her back strangled her neck grabbed her hair and told her to suck your penis you then held her neck to force her mouth to open and inserted your penis into her mouth you stopped when you saw the victim crying section 209 of the crimes decree 2009 provides that the maximum sentence for the offence of assault with intent to commit rape is 10 years in the case of jone tabaka v state 2013 fjhc 667 this court had endorsed an imprisonment of 1 to 4 years as the tariff for this offence the offence of sexual assault under section 210 1 of the crimes decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment following the case of state v laca 2012 fjsc 1414 this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault the maximum sentence for the offence of rape is imprisonment for life and the sentencing tariff for rape of a child is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years anand abhay raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 section 17 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 reads thus if an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them the three offences you are convicted of are based on the same facts therefore in view of the provisions of section 17 of the sentencing and penalties decree i opt to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the three offences i consider the following as aggravating factors you are victims stepfather there is a breach of trust you are 20 years older than the victim there was planning involved and you used your authority to compel the victim to be alone with you during the time of offence you used violence on her i consider the following as your mitigating factors you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity your counsel says you are remorseful you are 34 years old and married with 2 children in 2008 you have been convicted of the offence of attempted rape therefore i cannot consider you as a person of previous good character i consider 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence considering the aforementioned aggravating factors i add 7 years now your sentence is 17 years imprisonment you pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity thereby you saved courts time and also prevented the victim from having to relive her ordeal by giving evidence in this court therefore you deserve a one third reduction of your sentence i deduct 5 years and 8 months of your sentence for your early guilty plea and arrive at 11 years and 4 months for the other mitigating factors i deduct a further 1 year i hereby sentence you for an imprisonment term of 10 years and 4 months i order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 9 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 the offence of rape attracts the highest term of imprisonment considering the other two offences you are convicted of and the above sentence is within the tariff of the offence of rape when it comes to a child victim hence i am satisfied that the above aggregate sentence of imprisonment does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment had this court imposed separate terms of imprisonment for the three charges section 24 of the sentencing and the penalties decree reads thus if an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall unless a court otherwise orders be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender i note that you were first

recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him her when faced with a serious crime or crimes a court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to

about their whereabouts after matter was reported appellant was arrested and he admitted the offence in caution interview statement 1 this appeal against the sentence was filed on DATE within time 2 the grounds of appeal are i that the sentence imposed by the sentencing magistrate is harsh and excessive ii that the learned magistrate failed to consider the prompt early guilty plea on the very first instance in saving the courts time and resources in a defended trial iii that the learned magistrate failed to consider four classical principles of sentencing iv that no regard was given to the section 4 1 d of the sentencing and penalties decree as to the rehabilitation of the appellant and the sentence should have been suspended v that the learned magistrate failed to consider section 4 2 c of the sentencing and penalties decree in regards to the nature and gravity of this particular offence vi that the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration vii that the sentence is neither wrong in principle nor excessive in length but because of the impact of the sentence on the appellant 3 on DATE appellant requested to amend the grounds of appeal 4 accordingly he wants to maintain only one ground that is that the learned magistrate erred when his lordship took into account as an aggravating factor the fact that you have breached the dvro and by doing so resulted in the three years enhance of sentence being harsh and excessive 1 however in the written submissions filed by the appellant on DATE he had stated that he maintains the following grounds of appeal i that the sentence is harsh and excessive in exceeding the starting point tariff of 12 months ii failure to give proper credit of a reduction a third of the sentence to reflect the early guilty plea iii breach of dvro as an aggravating factor was wrongly considered and taken into account grounds i sentence harsh and excessive and exceeding the starting point tariff 1 the learned magistrate had selected a starting point of three years he had not mentioned any guideline judgment he had followed 2 in sasau v state 2012 fjhc 1301 hac 111 2009 hon mr justice paul madigan had held the maximum penalty for abduction is seven years imprisonment there has been no tariff set in this jurisdiction for the offence thurairaja j purported to set the tariff at six months to 18 months in the case of sadrugu hac 116 of 2011 where the learned judge said that tariff has been set in sanoka 2009 fjhc 91 this is incorrect sanoka did not set such a tariff sentencing for abduction has been discussed by the english court of appeal in spence and thomas 5 cr app r s 413 where the court said that a top end of sentencing range should be reserved for cases where the victim is taken hostage or a ransom has been demanded and at the maximum if undue violence or firearms are used the bottom end of the tariff can be appropriate in cases of family disputes or lovers tiffs as the maximum penalty for this offence is seven years both under the penal code and the crimes decree 2009 an appropriate tariff for the offence would be between 18 months and four years depending on the violence length of detention use of weapons etc 1 although the learned magistrate had not mentioned about this judgment the starting point taken by the magistrate is 3 years which is within the tariff however considering the facts and circumstances of this case it falls in the midline of the tariff and correct starting point should have been 2 years this ground has to be considered with the other grounds ground ii failure to give proper credit of a reduction a third of the sentence to reflect the early guilty plea 1 the learned magistrate had reached an interim sentence of 6 years after adding 3 years for aggravating factors then he had stated considering your compelling mitigation i deduct 1 3 of the interim sentence of 6 years then he had stated that final sentence is 2 years imprisonment it is not clear as how he arrived at this final figure as he had only deducted 2 years for mitigation to arrive at a final sentence of 2 years another 2 years has to be deducted however it is not recorded as to why this 2 years period is deducted 2 in basa v state 2006 fjca 23 aau 0024 2005 DATE the court of appeal held that the appellant suggests that the reference to the fact the plea of guilty was entered late means he was not given full credit for it whenever an accused person admits his guilt by pleading guilty the court will give some credit for that as a clear demonstration of remorse however the amount that will be given is not fixed and will depend on the offence charged and the circumstances of each case the maximum credit is likely to be given for offences such as rape and personal violence because it saves the victim having to relive the trauma in the witness box at the other end of the scale little or no credit may be given if the evidence is so overwhelming that the accused has no real option but to admit it where as here the accused has admitted the offence and the receipt of his share of the money the delay in pleading guilty must reduce the value of the plea considerably 1 at was held in naikelekelevesi v state 2008 fjca 11 aau 0061 2007 DATE that where there is a guilty plea this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factor in a case 2 the learned magistrate had erred by not awarding the appellant separate deduction for his guilty plea there is merit in this ground and it succeeds ground iii breach of dvro as an aggravating factor was wrongly considered and taken into account 1 the learned magistrate had added 3 years for the aggravating factors he had stated that the aggravating factor is your full knowledge that you have breached the dvro which you had consented to and that two nights you had kept the victim against her will i add 3 years 1 when the appellant is also charged for disobedience of dvro it is an error to consider the same as aggravating factor for the other charge the state in their submission had conceded this position therefore there is merit in this ground and it succeeds conclusion 1 this background warrants this court to exercise its powers in terms of section 256 3 of the criminal procedure decree to quash the sentence passed by the magistrate and pass other sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence within the acceptable range of tariff 2 accordingly i take a starting point of 2 years and add 1 year for the aggravating factor that the victim was kept away for two nights i deduct 6 months for the mitigating factors and another 1 year for the guilty plea the final sentence for the 1st charge is 1 year and 6 months 3 the sentence for the 2nd charge to stand at 12 months as the appellant had seriously violated the dvro within short period of time 4 considering totality principle i order both sentences to run concurrently 5

sentence submission the prosecution also submitted their written sentence submission i have carefully considered the papers submitted by you and the prosecution and i have listened very carefully to you two s verbal submissions 6 we will discuss the rape offence count no 2 first as it is the more serious of the two offences of the sexual offences rape is at the top of the criminal calendar it is the unwarranted invasion of person s body and dignity it is the worst form of sexual assault it invades the privacy of a person and unwanted intrusion into a person s dignity society views it seriously and through their representative in parliament had prescribed the maximum penalty of life imprisonment section 207 1 of the crimes act 2009 this crime in the past had only been prevalent amongst adults that is those over 18 years old however a disturbing trend had been witnessed in the courts more and more we have seen that the victims of this crime are increasingly the children of this country 7 so much so that in gordon aitcheson v the state criminal petition cav 012 of 2018 the supreme court of fiji on DATE the president of the supreme court of fiji his lordship the hon chief justice mr anthony gates said as follows 23 the increases are obvious even this court now has many more of such cases coming before it this sittings is also remarkable for the number of such cases listed for consideration 24 the increasing prevalence of these crimes crimes characterised by disturbing aggravating circumstances means the court must consider widening the tariff for rape against children it will be for judges to exercise their discretion taking into account the age group of these child victims i do not for myself believe that that judicial discretion should be shackled but it is obvious to state that crimes like these on the youngest children are the most abhorrent 25 the tariff previously set in raj v the state 2014 fjsc12 cav0003 2014 DATE should now be between 11 20 years imprisonment much will depend upon the aggravating and mitigating circumstances considerations of remorse early pleas and finally time spent on remand awaiting trial for the final sentence outcome the increased tariff represents the denunciation of the courts in the strongest terms 26 it is entirely possible that the sentencing judge when confronted with a particularly heinous rape as in state v isoa rainima crim case hac 064 of 2017s DATE may exceed the tariff when assessing all of the factors that was a case committed against an adult victim the total sentence came to 23 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 20 years 8 sexual assault contrary to section 210 1 a of the crimes act 2009 carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment 9 the aggravating factors in this case were as follows i breach of trust you are related to the child victim and you are her grandfather as such your role was to look after and care for her in a village setting that was expected of you however you abused the trust she had in you instead of looking after her you committed the offences against her this was done when no one was around you forced her to take her clothes off and committed the offences against her she was 6 years old at the time ii rape of a child we have said before and we will say again that we the courts will keep on passing heavy prison sentence against child rapists as a warning to others iii by offending against the child you had shown no regards to her right as a child her right as a human being and her right not to be harmed you also had caused heartache and sadness to her family 10 the mitigating factors were as follows i at the age of 55 years this was your first offence ii you had been remanded in custody awaiting trial for approximately 1 year 3 days from DATE iii although you pleaded guilty to the charges approximately 1 year after first call in the high court you nevertheless saved some court time iv you co operated with the police

270561,j u d g m e n t gates p 1 i have read the draft judgment of chandra j i am in agreement with its conclusions and the reasoning for it i concur with the orders proposed chandra j 2 the petitioner seeks leave to appeal to the supreme court from the judgment of the court of appeal dated DATE dismissing his appeal 3 at the hearing of the application of the petitioner counsel of the legal aid commission appeared and moved to withdraw from the case since the petitioner was seeking to dispense with the services of the legal aid commission and wanted to rely on the written submissions filed by him on the grounds set out in his notice of appeal 4 the petitioner had by letter dated DATE sent to the legal aid commission with copy to the director of public prosecutions and the registry of the supreme court indicated his decision to dispense with the assistance of the legal aid commission and that he would be relying on his written submissions filed on the DATE 5 the application of counsel for the legal aid commission to withdraw was allowed and the petitioner was permitted to make submissions on his behalf 6 the petitioner had filed his petition of appeal in june 2016 after the court of appeal had dismissed his appeal on DATE but the appeal had been forwarded to the registry by the naboro minimum corrections centre only on the DATE which was 11 days out of time although the application for leave to appeal was 11 days out of time it was considered as a proper application as the delay in forwarding his application was by the corrections centre 7 the grounds of appeal set out in his application seeking leave to appeal are as follows that the learned trial judge erred in law by failing to clearly direct the assessors about each element of rape that the prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his lordships direction in relation to the burden and standard of proof was insufficient and not precise that the learned trial judge erred in law by failing to direct the assessors about the inconsistencies in the statement out of court and evidence on oath of the virtual complainant 4 that the learned trial judge erred in his summing up resulting in a miscarriage of justice when he failed to direct the assessors about the lies told in court about the virtual complainant 5 that the learned trial judge erred in his summing up resulting in a miscarriage of justice when he failed to direct the assessors the following facts that are not bound by the expert opinion of dr salma hanif the findings of dr salma failed to specifically state that the hymen was not intact due to sexual activities the findings of dr salma is inconsistent with the allegation of rape 6 that the conviction and the verdict is safe unsatisfactory having regard to evidence inconsistencies and misdirection factual background 8 the petitioner was charged in the high court at lautoka for 3 counts of indecent assault contrary to section 154 1 and two counts of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the penal code after trial before three assessors the learned high court judge found the petitioner guilty on counts 1 2 and 5 for indecent assault and on counts 3 and 4 for rape as charged he was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 15 years 9 the victim 14 years of age at the time of giving evidence 2012 was the daughter of the petitioner the charges spanned from the year 2006 to 2010 the victim was living with her father petitioner mother two brothers and a younger sister in her evidence she recounted the events that she encountered her grandmother to whom she had complained also gave evidence medical evidence was led through dr salma hanif who stated in evidence that the hymen of the victim was not intact the petitioner did not give evidence nor did he lead any other evidence and relied on the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses 10 the court of appeal heard the arguments of the petitioner on the grounds set out in his petition of appeal to the court of appeal which are different from the grounds of appeal filed in this court the grounds of appeal on which his appeal was argued before the court of appeal were as follows against conviction that the learned judge had erred in law and denied the appellant a fair hearing because of non disclosure before or during trial of a letter dated DATE purporting the allegation against the appellant to be false and fabricated that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors how to approach the expert opinion evidence that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a fair and balanced summing up against sentence that the learned judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to separately discount the 9 months the appellant had spent in remand that the learned trial judge had erred in law when he subsumed the element of the offence as an aggravating feature that the sentence was in breach of section 14 2 n of the constitution of the republic of fiji islands 11 of these grounds of appeal the petitioner had abandoned ground a of the grounds against conviction 12 the grounds of appeal set out in his application for leave to appeal to the supreme court would ex facie appear to be different from the grounds urged and argued before the court of appeal however grounds 1 to 4 and 6 relate to the summing up of the learned trial judge on different aspects and could be considered under ground c of the grounds of appeal urged before the court of appeal and ground 5 can be considered under ground b of the grounds of appeal before the court of appeal 13 the jurisdiction of the supreme court is set out in section 98 3 of the constitution of fiji which states the supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction subject to such requirements as prescribed by written law to hear and determine appeals from all final judgments of the court of appeal section 98 4 of the constitution provides an appeal may not be brought to the supreme court from a final judgment of the court of appeal unless the supreme court grants leave to appeal section 7 2 of the supreme court act 1998 provides in relation to a criminal matter the supreme court must not grant special leave to appeal unless a question of general legal importance is involved a substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved or substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur 14 the threshold set by section 7 2 is very high unlike in an appeal from the high court to the court of appeal which is based on whether a ground of appeal is arguable an appeal against the judgment of the court of appeal to the supreme court must satisfy the threshold for special leave to appeal in the first instance the grounds of appeal should be in respect of the judgment of the court of appeal 15 in the present application the petitioner has urged that grave and substantial injustice has been caused to him however he has not set out the manner in which the court of appeal has erred in its judgment which has caused such grave and substantial injustice he has canvassed the same grounds of appeal before this court 16 i reiterate the views expressed in sachindra nand sharma v the state criminal appeal no cav 001 of 2016 DATE where i cited kosar mahmood v hksr famc no 31 of 2012 unreported by court of final appeal of the hong kong special administrative region to the following effect we wish to stress that in all future applications on the substantial and grave injustice ground the application for leave to appeal must identify the specific way in which it is submitted that the court below has departed from established legal norms and why such departure is so seriously wrong that justice demands a hearing before the court of final appeal notwithstanding the absence of any real controversy on any point of law of great and general importance it will simply not be sufficient merely to set out the same arguments that were canvassed in the court below 17 in the present appeal what has to be seen is whether the grounds of appeal raised by the petitioner give rise to a situation of grave and substantial miscarriage of justice for granting of leave ground 1 18 in this ground the petitioner submitted that the learned trial judge has failed to direct the assessors regarding the elements of rape that have to be proved and referred to paragraph 17 of the summing up which states 17 the offence of rape is defined in the penal code and the crimes decree according to our law the prosecution should prove that the accused had carnal knowledge of the virtual complainant in simple terms the prosecution should prove that the accused penetrated the vagina of the virtual complainant 19 when the appeal was argued before the court of appeal this aspect regarding the elements of rape had not been urged and therefore the court of appeal had not addressed its mind to same 20 the petitioner s contention before this court was that the direction of the learned trial judge was inadequate the elements of rape were adverted to by the learned trial judge only in paragraph 17 cited above it would appear that the learned trial judge has not stated anything about the consent of the victim counsel for the respondent in his counter submissions stated that the victim in the case was under 13 years at the time of the commission of the rape and therefore the question of consent did not arise on that basis it was his submission that there was no miscarriage of justice 21 it would have been better if the learned trial judge had elaborated more on the elements of rape in his direction to the assessors but since the question of consent was not material to the case before court there is no miscarriage of justice and therefore this ground would not assist the petitioner ground 2 22 the second ground is that the directions of the learned trial judge on the burden and standard of proof were inadequate and reference was made to the fact that it was only mentioned in paragraph 5 of the summing up this aspect of the summing up was not canvassed before the court of appeal and as a result the court of appeal had not addressed its mind to same 23 when considering the summing up of the learned trial judge he has dealt with the burden and standard of proof in his summing up not only in paragraph 5 but also in paragraphs 29 and 33 of the summing up which was adequate therefore there has been no miscarriage of justice as urged by the petitioner grounds 3 4 and 6 24 grounds 3 and 4 relate to the same aspect of the evidence of the victim and the summing up of the learned trial judge in relation to that evidence it was the contention of the petitioner that the evidence of the victim was inconsistent and that she had lied in her evidence 25 the petitioner was emphasizing on the last answer given by the victim under cross examination when she was asked whether she agreed that the complaint of rape is false she had answered in the affirmative it was unfortunate that the prosecution nor the learned trial judge had sought any clarification regarding this answer given by the victim under cross examination 26 the court of appeal dealt with this question and concluded thus 24 i have reproduced the related questions and answers in paragraphs 10 and 11 of this judgment it is unfortunate for both the prosecuting counsel as well as the learned judge to overlook the answer given by the victim to a question that was put to her having considered all the questions answers given i am of the view that the answer given as yes would have been nothing but a slip the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the failure of the learned counsel for the accused to address this issue in his address to the assessors shows that this answer yes did not mean a denial of the incident omitting to refer to this solitary answer by the learned judge itself did not cause a miscarriage of justice 27 the court of appeal had dealt with this question taking into account the entirety of the evidence at the trial and had arrived at the conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice in view of that finding by the court of appeal these three grounds of appeal urged by the petitioner would not have merit for granting leave to appeal ground 5 28 ground 5 addresses the medical evidence led at the trial and the learned trial judge s direction to the assessors regarding same being inadequate 29 the court of appeal dealt with this question in detail and stated as follows 19 the medical evidence is unchallenged that evidence is that the hymen of the victim is not intact at the time of giving evidence the victim was 14 years of age there is no evidence of the victim associating with any males the only man with whom she had had sex with was her own father the medical opinion for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration that is due to having had sex with someone the doctor cannot say who that someone is the victim s evidence is that it is the father although it was suggested to the doctor that a girl of the age of the victim can lose the hymen due to vigorous sports activity there is no such evidence it is true that the learned judge had failed to analyse the evidence and explain that the assessors are not bound by the opinion of the doctor that the losing of the hymen was due to vaginal penetration the learned judge said to the assessors that they are judges of facts he also said that if an opinion had been expressed by him with regard to facts that the assessors are not obliged to accept it the assessors were told that they have to consider all the evidence and decide it appears that there is no strict rule to say that the trial judge is bound to tell the assessors that they are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor it was held in fitzpatrick 1999 crim l r 832 that a failure slavishly to follow this formula does not automatically render a conviction unsafe in this case i am of the view that it would have been better if the judge said to the assessors that they are not bound by the opinion expressed by the doctor that the reason for the hymen not to be intact is due to vaginal penetration in addition to the opinion expressed by the doctor the vaginal penetration has been established through the evidence of the victim and the grandmother therefore not giving a warning that the assessors are not bound to follow the opinion of the doctor cannot be considered as fatal however by considering the fact that the evidence led was short and it not being a complex case no prejudice was caused and no miscarriage of justice has occurred 30 the court of appeal has dealt with this ground adequately and no error can be found regarding the conclusion reached regarding same conclusion 31 in the above circumstances as the application for leave to appeal to the supreme court of the petitioner alleging grave and substantial miscarriage of justice has not satisfied the threshold required for granting such leave his application is refused and the application is dismissed calanchini j 32 i agree that leave to appeal should be refused the order of the court leave to appeal is refused hon chief justice anthony gates president of the supreme court

by their unanimous decision the three assessors found you guilty of the lesser or the alternative charge of defilement of a young person between 13 and 16 years of age defilement contrary to section 215 1 of the crimes act no 44 of 2009 crimes act 5 having reviewed the evidence this court was of the opinion that the unanimous decision of the assessors in finding you guilty of defilement was justified in the circumstances court found you guilty and convicted you of defilement 6 at the time of the incident you were 15 years of age and as such a juvenile 7 in terms of the juveniles act as amended a juvenile has been defined to mean a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years and includes a child and a young person a child means a person who has not attained the age of fourteen years while a young person means a person who has attained the age of fourteen years but who has not attained the age of eighteen years 8 furthermore section 20 of the juveniles act stipulates that the words conviction and sentence shall not be used in relation to juveniles and any reference in any written law to a person convicted a conviction or a sentence shall in the case of juvenile persons be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding as the case may be 9 in terms of section 20 of the juveniles act it is clear that the words conviction and sentence shall not be used in relation to juveniles thus the reference made by me in my judgment dated DATE that you have been convicted has been made per incuriam court could only have made a finding of guilt against you 10 pursuant to the said finding of guilt i now proceed to impose the punishment against you 11 section 30 of the juveniles act imposes certain restrictions on the punishments which courts could order against juvenile offenders the section provides that 1 no child shall be ordered to be imprisoned for any offence 2 no young person shall be ordered to be imprisoned for an offence or to be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine damages or costs unless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in an approved institution or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained 3 a young person shall not be ordered to be imprisoned for more than two years for any offence emphasis is mine 12 section 4 of the sentencing and penalties act no 42 of 2009 sentencing and penalties act stipulates the relevant factors that a court should take into account during the sentencing process i have duly considered these factors in determining the punishment to be imposed on you 13 in terms of section 215 1 of the crimes act 1 a person commits a summary offence if he or she unlawfully and carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any person being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of 16

found in the penal code chapter 17 17 in livinai namami v the state 1979 fca 55 1995 41 flr 152 DATE where the accused appellant appealed the sentence of 2½ years imprisonment on a charge of defilement of his girlfriend aged 15½ years his lordship justice fatiaki held on the facts of this case there can be little doubt that this was a case of a virtuous friendship between two young people that ended with them having sexual intercourse with one another certainly it falls within that category of offending where it is inappropriate to pass sentences of a punitive nature in this case the learned trial magistrate sentenced the appellant on an incorrect factual basis in that the complainant was not then under 15 years of age at the time of the offence furthermore no consideration appears to have been given to the minimal age difference between the parties and finally as conceded by learned state counsel there is no record that the learned trial magistrate was aware that the appellant was a student at the time of sentencing him insofar as it may be possible to give some guidance in the matter on a charge of defilement under section 156 1 a of the penal code cap 17 this court is firmly of the view that in the absence of aggravating factors and subject to a favourable social welfare officers report where the age difference between the accused and the complainant is less than 4 years a non custodial sentence is appropriate in the light of the above and for the foregoing reasons the appeal was allowed and the appellant and his father were ordered to enter into a recognizance of 100 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months and further conditioned that the appellant was not to associate with the complainant 18 in state v kabaura 2010

you were then arrested and interviewed under caution you admitted assaulting and raping your wife maximum sentence 5 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment tariff for rape 6 the tariff for rape in fiji is well settled when the victim is an adult a minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment should be imposed 7 in mohamed kasim v the state unreported cr case no 14 of 1993 DATE fiji court of appeal observed while it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances we think the time has come for this court to give a clear guidance to the courts in fiji generally on this matter we consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage we must stress however that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point 8 maximum punishment prescribed for assault causing actual bodily harm is imprisonment for 5 years the tariff rangers from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment state v tugalala 2008 fjhc 78 hac 025 2008s 9 in state v tugalala supra justice shameem said the tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment the high court said in elizabeth joseph v the state 2004 haa 030 04s and state v tevita alafi 2004 haa 073 04s that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence the use of a pen knife for instance justifies a higher starting point where there has been a deliberate assault causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation a discharge is not appropriate in domestic violence cases sentences of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld amasai korovata v the state 2006 haa 115 06s 10 statistics for domestic violence in fiji are always awful for some spouses this can include rape most of the cases do not come to light because some victims think the sustainability of marriage is far more important and don t take trouble to complain some of them remain passive partners due to ignorance shame fear or cultural taboos it is incredible to think before 1992 that a man could rape his wife the wife was deemed to consent to sexual intercourse on marrying the husband in r v r 1992 ac 599 the house of lords recognized the sexual autonomy of a spouse within institution of marriage and the requirement for the prosecution to prove that sexual intercourse had taken place outside marriage was abandoned 11 state v ismail 2014 fjhc 628 hac115 2012 DATE janaka bandara j observed the law pertaining to rape is well settled in this jurisdiction when the victim is over thirteen 13 years consent is an essential element to have sexual intercourse in other words what matters is the consent but not the relationship the perpetrator shares with the victim in the eyes of the law irrespective of their gender everybody is equal and treated equally a spouse is of no exception if a wife is compelled to have sexual intercourse or oral or anal sex against her will by the use of authority force or by threat of using force she has a right to say no to such sexual demands of a husband if the husband decides to proceed ahead despite of that no he risks of being criminally liable for raping his own wife 12 this sentence is passed not only to denounce your offending and punish you but also to send a clear massage to the society that marital rape the worst form of domestic violence is no longer tolerated in fiji when sexual intimacy is egoistically used to despoil marital union in order to advance a felonious urge for coitus by force violence or intimidation the court will step into protect sanctity of marriage vindicate justice and protect our laws and state policies 13 you committed these offences on your wife who was three months pregnant at that time you also used violence on her in addition to the digital penetration an act in itself constituted violence a man who penetrates his wife without her consent commits sexual violence in a domestic relationship marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity having considered high culpability factors and the harm caused to the victim i take 9 years as the starting point for the offence of rape count before taking into consideration the aggravating and mitigation factors aggravating factors 14 you breached the trust the

saved precious time and resources of this court and also saved your wife from going through the ordeal again in this court you seek forgiveness of this court and of your wife your wife indicated to this court that she accepted the apology you tendered i accept your remorse as genuine 20 i understand the difficult situation your wife and children are getting into when they are separated from you

magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree 2009 and in particular sections 4 5 9 15 16 and 45 when sentencing the appellant appeal against the conviction 1 the appellant had pleaded guilty to the count against him and admitted the summary of facts on 24 6 2013 2 in the written submissions of mitigation filed by the appellant before the learned magistrate he had prayed for dismissal of the charge without recording a conviction acting under sections 15 1 j 16 1 and 45 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree on the basis that such conviction will jeopardize his prospects of employment 3 the learned magistrate had considered the question whether it would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case to enter a no conviction against the appellant and to discharge him 4 he had considered the judgment of state v kumar 2001 fjhc 101 haa 0014 20 DATE where it was held that the court in its sentencing remarks said rightly it was faced with a very awkward situation for this accused was facing dismissal from his employment if a conviction were to be entered nevertheless a discharge without conviction being entered was not an appropriate sentence here absolute discharges are appropriate only in limited number of circumstances such as where no moral blame attaches r v otoole 1971 55 cr app p 206 or where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty r v kavanagh unreported DATE ca 1 further the case of state v david batiratu revisional case no har001 2012 was also considered by the learned magistrate it was held in that case by the hon chief justice that the effect of the cases and the purport of the more detailed provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree with regard to discharges can be summarized if a discharge without conviction is urged upon the court the sentencer must consider the following question whether a the offender is morally blameless b whether only a technical breach in the law has occurred c whether the offence is of a trivial and minor nature d whether the public interest in the enforcement and effectiveness of the legislation is such that escape from penalty is not consistent with that interest e whether circumstances exist in which it is appropriate to record a conviction or merely to impose nominal punishment f are there any other extenuating or exceptional circumstances a rare situation justifying a court showing mercy to an offender 1 the learned magistrate then stated that when considering the above questions the offender in this case cannot be said to be morally blameless the offending was deliberate and theres no technical breach of the law in addition as noted earlier the nature of the offending in this case is serious and not trivial it is domestic violence offence and due to its seriousness it is no longer a reconcilable offence in the public interest and to ensure that enforcement of the law is effective a punishment is warranted due to seriousness of the charge there are no exceptional circumstances in this case that justify no conviction to be entered and offender to be discharged therefore in exercising my discretion a conviction will have to be entered and as it would be wrong in principle to discharge you without conviction 1 i totally agree with the observations of the learned magistrate in the back ground of the cited authorities 2 further in state v kumar 2001 fjhc 340 2001 2flr 225 DATE it was held by his lordship anthony gates that the respondent prior to the sentence has suffered in various ways the case went through many adjournments in the magistrates court for nearly 3 years he suffered interdiction without pay this had the equivalent effect of a substantial time his wife had earlier left him he was trying to look after the two children to whom he had to act as mother and father i had been informed that he was to pay 100 to the complainant as compensation which compensation the victim has now confirmed has been paid upon the basis that a punishment if it were to result in the loss of the respondents livelihood with the police would be disproportionate to the crime committed i ordered that the respondent be discharged absolute without conviction entered this cannot be a precedent however for the imposition of absolute discharges in cases of this sort 1 it was cited in approval the reasoning of richard j in fisheries inspector v turner 1978 2 nzlr 233 at p241 who described the extend of the sentencing discretion for a section not very different from section 44 of the fijis penal code in considering the exercise of the discretion under s42 the court is required to balance all the relevant public interest considerations that apply in the particular case or as s42 1 puts it after inquiry into the circumstances of the case which must refer to all circumstances that are relevant in the particular case before the court it must have due regard to the nature of the offence and the gravity with which it is viewed by parliament to the seriousness of the particular offending to the circumstances of the particular offender in terms of the effect on his career his pocket his reputation and any civil disabilities consequential on conviction and to any other relevant circumstances and if the direct and indirect consequences of a conviction are in courts judgment out of all proportion to the gravity of the offence it is proper for the a discharge to be given under s42 1 the appellant by his counsel had submitted that the learned magistrate should have taken section 16 1 c of the sentencing and penalties decree into consideration and not order a conviction to be entered he submits that as he is a first offender and there is reconciliation it is a suitable case for not recording a conviction 2 section 16 1 of the sentencing and penalties decree reads as follows section 16 1 in exercising his discretion whether or not record a conviction a court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including a the nature of the offence b the character and past history of the offender and c the impact of a conviction on the offenders economic or social well being and on his or her employment prospects 1 the operative word in this section is discretion where the magistrate had exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power that it would be in very exceptional circumstances that an appellate court would interfere with that exercise 2 this is particularly so in cases of domestic violence which this case is the domestic violence decree is clearly a decree to provide greater protection from domestic violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not to record a conviction against a perpetrator 3 further according to section 154 6 of the criminal procedure decree promotion of reconciliation is not applicable to offences of domestic violence as defined by the domestic violence decree 2009 4 the appellant had pleaded guilty to the offence and had admitted the summary of facts which go to the elements of the offence the learned magistrate had exercised his discretion correctly thus there is merit in the grounds against the conviction and those fails 1 the appeal against the conviction is dismissed appeal against the sentence 1 the learned magistrate had taken a starting point of 9 months for aggravating factors namely the prevalence of the offence in community and lack of provocation he had added 2 months this being the first offence and other mitigating factors 2 months was reduced further 3 months were reduced for the guilty plea arriving at a sentence of 6 months 2 then the learned magistrate had considered the suspension of the sentence he had stated that although the nature of the offending was unprovoked this is your first offence and you need to be given opportunity to reform yourself therefore i am going to suspend your sentence 3 the sentence of 6 months imprisonment was suspended for 2 years further he had made permanent the interim restraining orders made under section 27 2 of the domestic violence decree on DATE 4 the learned magistrate had followed the following tariff judgments state v salote tugalala hac 25 of 2008 elizabeth joseph v the state 2004 haa 030 2004s state v tevita alafi 2004 haa 073 2004s amasi korovata v the state 2006 haa 115 2006s according to these judgments the tariff for the offence of common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment in state v tevita alafi 2004 haa 073 2004s it is stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence where there has been a deliberate assault causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation a discharge is not appropriate in domestic violence cases sentence of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld amasi korovata v the state 2006 haa 115 2006s 1 in raisoqoni v state 2011 fjhc 32 haa 004 20 DATE hon mr justice daniel gounder held that the domestic violence decree has changed the old law under the new law domestic violence offences are not reconcilable and therefore there is no discretion given to the courts to encourage reconciliation however if the victim freely reconciles with the partner and gives evidence of that effect reconciliation is a factor that ought to be taken into account in sentencing the offender the term of six months imprisonment was within the tariff and was arrived at after all relevant factors were taken into account 1 in state v kumar 2011 fjhc 341 haa 020 2 DATE hon mr justice paul madigan held that a domestic violence offence which this obviously is cannot be reconciled and in any event the court record notes that the victim did not want to reconcile it is incumbent upon the tribunal or officer of the court to have regard to the domestic violence decree which came into force on the DATE the decree was enacted to protect persons men women and children from abuse in domestic environment and if the courts do not make findings and rulings within the spirit of the decree then that altruistic arm is thwarted setting aside a penalty of 100 compensation a term of 6 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years was ordered in this case 1 in chand v state 2011 fjhc 593 haa 024 2011 DATE hon mr justice paul madigan held that assaults in a domestic context are particularly odious in that wives and husband for that matter should feel safe in their homes without having their trust i their loved ones betrayed the learned magistrate was quite correct in finding that the domestic element to this offending was an aggravating feature 1 in botaki v state 2012 fjhc 1250 haa 015 20 DATE hon mr justice paul madigan held that the question of reconciliation in a domestic violence is a difficult one it is quite clear that it is not a reconcilable offence it being a domestic violence case and that being so reconciliation as a mitigating factor is of very dubious value a female victim will nearly always say that the parties are reconciled because she will fear the loss of the family breadwinner and supporter or she is forced to say it by her accused husband a sentencing tribunal should always therefore look at a submission of reconciliation with great caution and suspicion in this case although the magistrate has listed reconciliation as a mitigating factor he later expresses doubts whether it was voluntary or not because the victim did not confirm it in court it was a submission of the accused 1 the learned magistrate had not mentioned that he considered reconciliation as a ground of mitigation however he had deducted 2 months for mitigation in the circumstances the learned magistrate is justified in making that deduction for all the mitigation 2 the sentence is well within the accepted tariff for the offence the magistrate has not made any error of law in passing the sentence and in the circumstances it is entirely appropriate sentence the appeal against the sentence has no merit and is dismissed

74009,judgment the appellant was on the DATE charged with the following offence statement of offence indecent assault contrary to section 154 1 of the of the penal code act 17 particulars of offence jone boa on the DATE at lami in the central division unlawfully and indecently assaulted a woman namely mere delaivuna he pleaded guilty but the trial commenced because he disputed the facts outlined by the prosecution the prosecution called mere delaivuna the complainant and two police officers the evidence was that on DATE the complainant whose husband is a soldier and was away at monasavu was alone at home with her three children she went to sleep at 8pm between 3am and 4am that night a person came into her bedroom and touched her vaginal area she woke up and saw the appellant in the light that was on in the sitting room he ran away she tried to switch on the light but could not she then went to the main switch and found it had been turned off she turned it on and followed the appellant outside and saw him running away she did not see his face but recognised him by his build she said she knew the appellant well because he visited the house regularly the police witnesses tendered the appellant s police statements in which he had confessed to the offence he had initially denied going to the complainant s house that night but when he was told that his father s statement contradicted his he changed his story he said he had gone to the complainant s house to see one semesa and saw the complainant lying there he then touched her private parts she got up and he ran outside he said that he was the complainant s first cousin the appellant when cross examining the police witnesses suggested that they threatened him to make him confess he gave sworn evidence saying that the police had failed to record everything he had said under cross examination he said the complainant s evidence was untrue and that he had been forced by the police to give his statement he said the police officer who caution interviewed me didn t punch me the police charging officer didn t punch me i confessed because the police threatened me they said they will lock me in the cell and punch me i can t remember the officer s number i had pain in the ribs i didn t seek medical examination i didn t report the matter to the police he called a witness vika rodgers who said that she had been with the appellant at 2am on DATE she said she didn t know where the appellant was at 3am the learned magistrate said that although the complainant s evidence of identification was not reliable he accepted the evidence of the confession he found the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt convicted the appellant and sentenced him to two years imprisonment the appellant appeals against conviction and sentence on several grounds which i summarise for the sake of convenience 1 the identification evidence was unreliable 2 the victim had said that the appellant was doing the same thing to other married women 3 there was no corroboration 4 there was evidence of an alibi which should have been accepted 5 the magistrate refused to hear witnesses 6 the sentence of two years imprisonment was harsh and excessive at the hearing of the appeal the appellant abandoned most of these grounds and argued only that the evidence of identification was unreliable and that he had been assaulted in police custody by the interviewing officer and that therefore the statements ought to have been excluded state counsel opposed the appeal he conceded that the learned magistrate ought to have dealt more thoroughly with the evidence relating to the admissibility of the confession but said that there was ample evidence to justify conviction he further submitted that the sentence was appropriate and fell within the tariff for indecent assault cases identification the learned magistrate did not rely on the evidence of identification because he said the complainant had not seen the assailant s face thus this ground of appeal lacks merit because the evidence was not relied upon of course it is arguable that because the complainant was identifying a close relative who was a regular visitor recognition of his build might have been acceptable as safe identification evidence however an assessment of the quality of identification evidence is usually best left to the trial court on the basis of the length of the encounter the lighting and the nature of the relationship between the witness and the accused in this case the learned magistrate assessed the evidence to be unreliable the appellant s first ground of appeal is therefore based on a misapprehension of the basis of the judgment the confession the learned magistrate directed himself generally about the burden and standard of proof but did not do so specifically in respect of the admissibility of the confession he said that he accepted the evidence of the two police officers who interviewed and charged the appellant and rejected the evidence of the appellant which he said was contradictory in itself it is unfortunate that the learned trial magistrate did not direct himself on the law relevant to the admissibility of confessions in all cases the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that any confession made to a person in authority is voluntary and not obtained by unfair means or by oppression however if he had so directed himself i doubt that the result would have been different the appellant said he was not assaulted then that he was at the hearing of this appeal he said he had been assaulted in the chest by the interviewing officer at the trial he alleged only threats but then appeared to allege assault on the ribs his evidence was clearly incredible and any reasonable tribunal would have rejected it there were no credible grounds to challenge the admissibility of the confession thus whilst the learned magistrate erred in failing to refer to the test for admissibility or to the burden of proof i find that there was no miscarriage of justice this ground of appeal also fails sentence the sentence of 2 years imprisonment falls within the tariff for indecent assault cases in this country in ratu veretariki kadavu v state crim app no haa 049 of 2000l prakash j after reviewing a number of indecent assault sentences said that a custodial sentence of between 1 and 4 years is the tariff in this case the appellant assaulted a woman who trusted him as a relative entered her home in the middle of the night as she lay asleep and touched her vagina the circumstances show a number of aggravating features and no mitigating ones in the circumstances i decline to reduce the sentence this appeal is wholly dismissed nazhat shameem judge at suva DATE paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy

state appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed we consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years it must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage 07 in the case of state v at 2011 fjhc360 hac 035 2011s DATE hon justice temo remarked that in my view order has to be established in the juvenile world young persons who are approaching adulthood i e 18 years old should not be allowed to exploit the venerable in the juvenile world in this case a 17 years 10 months and 03 days old juvenile takes the advantage of a 04 years old juvenile in my view it is the duty of the court to step in and protect the most venerable in the juvenile world this is especially so when those who are approaching adulthood i e 18 years old take advantage of the young by raping them to commit rape against the young in my view is the characteristic of a depraved character and a custodial sentence within the ambit of the juvenile act is called

as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person 10 i have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the sentencing and penalties decree no 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence 11 section 15 3 of the sentencing decree provides that as a general principle of sentencing a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4 and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the general sentencing provisions of the decree 12 the objectives of sentencing as found in section 4 1 of the decree are as follows 1 to punish offenders to an extent and a manner which is just in all the circumstances 2 to protect the community from offenders 3 to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature 4 to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated 5 to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences or 6 any combination of these purposes 13 section 4 2 of the decree further provides that in sentencing offenders a court must have regarded to a the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence b current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline judgments c the nature and gravity of the particular offence d the defenders culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence e the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury loss or damage resulting from the offence f whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence and if so the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so 14 now i consider the aggravating factors 1 that the offence was committed on a juvenile 2 the offence was committed by two juveniles 3 the victim was threatened with assault 4 that the victim was forced to commit sexual acts by the two juveniles 5 the

251317,sentence 1 the accused has been convicted in this court after trial on one count of rape 2 he has been found to have raped his 27 year old first cousin who for the purposes of this sentence we shall refer to as donna not her real name 3 although 27 years donna has the mental age of a subteen and has great difficulty in coping with day to day life she has relied on her mother since birth to guide and protect her 4 on the DATE donna s mother went to town and left donna in the care of the accused for a few hours the accused was at the time staying temporarily in the family home 5 whilst alone the accused took donna into the bedroom undressed her and raped her when the mother returned she learned that something had occurred but donna was too frightened to tell her the detail all was revealed to an aunt about 10 days later and a report made to the police 6 the accused had said in evidence that donna had insisted on sex and had raped him a defence that wasn t believed neither by the assessors nor the court the accused 7 in mitigation for the accused counsel told the court that he is now 20 years of age and works as a carpentry assistant to his father he is a member of a large family with 7 siblings 8 he is said to be remorseful although the court saw no evidence of such and he asks for forgiveness he has sought forgiveness from donna s family 9 he is a practicing christian and wishes to be free to bring his faith to others 10 he is young and wishes to pursue a technical education at the technical college in labasa 11 he has spent 4 months in remand awaiting trial and he has one previous conviction for indecent assault the tariff 12 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the sentencing range for rape of an adult is well settled to be between 7 to 15 years marawa 2004 fjhc 338 per gates j as he then was and kasim c app 14 of 1993 c a unreported 13 rapes of children attract sentences of between 10 to 16 years raj cav003 of 2014 supreme court this sentence 14 this rape was the rape of a 27 year old who because of mental impairment acted and thought as a 10 year old would that being so it greatly aggravates the offence or alternatively removes the case from the adult range and places it into the child range rapes of children are regarded by the courts as far more serious than rapes of adults in that children are not yet mature enough to cope emotionally with sexual violation and if subject to such abuse their own progress to sexual maturity can well be jeopardized 15 to rape a mental defective can have the same disastrous consequences and it for this reason that sentences should be passed in the range pari passu with the mental age of the victim 16 this crime therefore must be sentenced within the range of rapes of children that is a sentence of between 10 to 16 years 17 i take a starting point of 10 years it is grossly aggravating that the accused should have breached the trust placed in him by his aunt to care for donna whilst she was away for that aggravation i add three years to the sentence it is also an aggravating factor that the victim of the rape was mentally impaired but as discussed earlier this aggravation is subsumed in sentencing the accused within the higher child tariff 18 the accused although young does not have the advantage of a clear record he already having been convicted of a minor but sexual offence in 2016 19 the court is not impressed with his mitigation of remorse and desire for forgiveness but his major mitigatory advantage is found in his very young age he was 19 when committing the offence and 20 years of age at present the courts have always been at pains to treat young offenders with mercy and to keep them from the baneful and corrupting influences of an adult prison community such good intentions however must be balanced with the seriousness of the offence he or she is convicted of 20 this offence is very serious indeed and the youth of the accused must be overshadowed by the gravity of his crime 21 the only mitigating features that can assist this accused are his time spent in remand and his very young age i deduct a generous 6 months to reflect the remand period served and so the sentence that the accused shall serve will be one of 12 years and 6 months 22 i order that he serve a minimum term of 9 years before being eligible for parole this lenient minimum term is not intended to distort the tariff for rapes of children but is a concession to this young and impetuous youth 23 i make a domestic violence restraining order against the accused as perpetrator and the victim as the protected person an order to be in effect until further order of the court summary 24 final sentence 12 years 6 months minimum term 9 years p k madigan judge at labasa DATE paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,1,915

offenders are also from kioa island the victim and the offenders grew up together in the same village in kioa island the victim treated the offenders as her brothers they visited each others homes and the victim and her parents trusted the offenders 3 on DATE the victim joined the company of the offenders and a girl for a drinking party after a wedding ceremony in the village after consuming substantial amount of liquor the victim passed out while she was unconscious the offenders sexually assaulted her 4 the first sexual assault was committed by elifasa uili he kissed and sucked the victims neck while she lay unconscious she sustained visible contusions love bites on her neck 5 the second sexual assault was more serious saila asaeli undressed the victim and raped her while she lay unconscious 6 both assaults were witnessed by the girl who was in their company she was threatened by saila asaeli when she caught him having sexual intercourse with the victim 7 the maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment the case of rokota v state criminal appeal haa0068 of 2002 established the tariff for indecent assault to range from 12 months to 4 years imprisonment although rokotas case was considered under the repealed penal code the principles are applicable under the crimes decree because the maximum penalty is the same in rokota shameem j stated the gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence the indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence the nature of the assault whether it was penetrative whether gratuitous violence was used whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated all reflect of the gravity of the offence mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence 8 the maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment the maximum penalty for rape under the crimes decree is same as in the repealed penal code in kasim v state criminal appeal no 21 of 1993 the court of appeal established the starting point of 7 years imprisonment for the rape of an adult 9 elifasa uili was 26 years old at the time of the offending he joined the police force in 2005 as a constable in 2009 he was suspended from the police force for a disciplinary offence he was never recalled to the force and the chances of him now being recalled is slim due to this conviction now he is 27 years old he is single and unemployed 10 saila asaeli was 20 years old at the time of the offending now he is 21 years old he is single and works as a salesperson at his sisters clothes shop 11 the only mitigating factor for elifasa uili is his previous good character 12 for saila asaeli the mitigating factors are his previous good character and young age 13 i give considerable weight to these mitigating factors 14 i take into account that the offenders spent one month in custody on remand 15 the offending has aggravating features present while no physical violence or weapon was used on the victim the assaults took place while she was unconscious the offenders took advantage of the victims state of unconsciousness she was not capable of resisting or defending herself she was not aware of the assaults and would not have known about it if not informed by the witness to the assaults 16 the victim trusted the offenders the trust was build over years as they grew up together in the same village the offenders breached that trust having no regard whatsoever that the victim considered them as her brothers in these circumstances trust once breached cannot be re gained the offenders clearly exploited the victim as sex object when they found her unconscious these are serious aggravating factors and the court must denounce any conduct that threat women as sex object any form of sexual assault on a woman is not only an attack on her body but is an attack on her soul the perpetrators of sexual assaults on women must be deterred by punishment that reflects the gravity

255439,sentence 1 this is another case where a child was raped by a close relative the offender is the cousin brother of the victim the victim was raped when she went to her farm in lekutu with her parents and siblings during the christmas break in 2015 she was 12 years old and a primary school student at the material time 2 the accused lured the victim inside his house next to her farmhouse after exposing his private genitals to her when she went to wash dishes at a tap outside his house when she entered the house he performed oral sex on her and then had sexual intercourse with her she did not report the incident to anyone until nine months later when she confided in her school teacher about what her cousin had done to her 3 the seriousness of any offence is determined by the maximum penalty prescribed for it for rape it is life imprisonment the tariff for rape of a child is 10 16 years imprisonment raj v state 2014 fjsc 12 cav0003 2014 DATE 4 rape of a child is so abhorrent that a condign punishment must be imposed to mark the community s outrage against such crime sexual violence against children by their relatives is too prevalent in our society rape is the worst form sexual violence the courts will continue to take a tough stance on offenders who rape children by imposing long prison sentences to denounce the crime and to give effect to the principle of deterrence for others 5 in this case there is very little evidence of remorse by the offender there was evidence of a traditional apology made to the victim s family in which the offender had cried but the value of that apology diminished when the offender took the defence of alibi at the trial what value an apology has when the offender later claims that he was not at the location of the crime at the material time and the allegation of rape against him was fabricated by the victim 6 when the offender committed the crime he was 18 years old now he is 21 years and married with a child he supports his family and elderly parents by farming he is a first time offender the mitigating factors are the offender s young age and previous good character 7 the aggravating factors are the offender is the victim s cousin brother as an adult male relative he breached the victim and her family s trust the victim was vulnerable due to her young age and her socio economic background she came from a rural community with little support to report sexual abuse due to cultural constraints the sexual abuse had a psychological toll on the victim it took the victim nine months to confide and report to her school teacher she cried when she relayed the abuse to her teacher 8 after taking all these factors into account the offender is sentenced to 11 years imprisonment the remand period is three months the remaining term to be served is 10 years and 9 months imprisonment due to the offender s youth at the time of the offence and his previous good character the prospect of rehabilitation is high i decline to fix a non parole period hon mr justice daniel goundar solicitors office of the director of public prosecutions for state office of the director of legal aid commission for accused paclii copyright policy disclaimers privacy policy feedback url url ,1,587
