COUNT 6

Statement of Offence
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
JONE SOKIVETA on the 23rd day of December 2012 at Bemana, Navosa in the Western Division inserted his penis into the vagina of AD, without her consent. 

	1.	When the case was mentioned to take a plea the accused pleaded guilty to all the charges and admitted the Summary of Facts on the next day.

	2.	The Summary of Facts submitted by the State Counsel states as follows:

The Accused is one JONE SOKIVETA, 36 years old, a Farmer of Bemana Village in Navosa in the Western Division.

The First Victim is one KLR, 31 years old, a Teacher of Bemana Catholic Secondary School. The Second Victim is one AD, 18 years old, a Student of Bemana Catholic Secondary School.

On the 23rd of December 2012, Ms. AD was residing with Ms. KLR in a housing quarter at the Bemana Catholic Secondary School compound. They were at home asleep when the Accused came at about 12pm drunk and wanted to sleep in the house. At that particular time the Accused and Ms. KLR were in a de-facto relationship. Ms. AD informed Ms. KLR that the Accused was outside but the latter informed him to go and sleep in Bemana Village.

COUNT 1: BURGLARY contrary to Section 312 (3) (a) and (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

After being told to leave, the Accused got angry and forcefully tried to open the front door. Ms. KLR had to brace herself against the door while Ms. AD stood near the back door. The Accused forcefully opened the back door and entered the house belonging to Ms. KLR as a trespasser with intent to cause harm therein.

COUNT 2: COMMON ASSAULT contrary to Section 274 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

After he forcefully entered the house, Ms. KLR ran outside together with Ms. AD to escape. However, the Accused managed to get hold of Ms. AD and slapped her on the cheek before dragging her outside.

COUNT 3: COMMON ASSAULT contrary to Section 274 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

After he dragged her outside, the Accused pushed her to go towards Bemana Village. On their way towards the Village, Ms. AD heard voices of two men coming towards them. She attempted to seek their help when the Accused grabbed her and pushed her towards a barbed wire.

COUNT 4: COMMON ASSAULT contrary to Section 274 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

The Accused in anger also punched Ms. AD on the head and threatened her to keep quiet as they made their way to the Village.

COUNT 5: RAPE contrary to Section 207 (1) AND (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

In order to avoid the two men, the Accused followed another track with Ms. AD at the front. When they came across a plantation of one Semi Kunatani, the Accused pushed her to the ground, forced her shoulders back and forcefully pulled her shorts and maroon panty down before inserting his erected penis into her vagina without her consent. Ms. AD cried in pain but could not defend herself as she was frightened of him.

After sexual intercourse for about 30 minutes, the Accused ejaculated in her and made her sit down. He then told her to accompany him to Bemana Village so Ms. AD got up and dressed herself. At Bemana Village the Accused told her not to tell anyone what had happened which she did. Afterwards, he then told her to accompany her to his farm house which she did.

COUNT 6: RAPE contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

On their way to the Accused's farm with Ms. AD in the front, he suddenly got wild and pulled her shorts down. As she stood, he then attempted to insert his penis into her vagina via her thighs but he could not so he told her bend down. She cried out that she did not want to. He then grabbed hold of her neck with both hands and made her lie down. He then inserted his erected penis into her vagina without her consent. They then had sexual intercourse for about 15 minutes before he ejaculated inside her.

After having forced sexual intercourse with her, the Accused took Ms. AD to his family hall. In the hall, Ms. AD waited for the Accused to fall asleep before she escaped. She then reported the matter to a Police Officer named Uraia before she informed Ms. KLR. Ms. AD was medically examined by Dr. Dasi on the 23rd of December 2012 where the following findings were noted in the Medical Report (annexed as ""PE-1""):

1. Bruises on neck
2. Bruises on inner thighs
3. Laceration on vaginal wall
4. Hymen not intact

The Accused was subsequently arrested, interviewed and charged by Police Officers at the Keyasi Police Station.

	1.	After carefully considering the Plea of the accused to be unequivocal this Court found him guilty for Burglary contrary to Section 312 (3) (a) and (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, three charges of Common Assault contrary to Section 274 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009 and two charges of Rape contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.

	2.	Accused you stand convicted for Burglary, three charges of Common Assault and two charges of Rape.

	3.	Section 312 prescribes a maximum sentence of 13 years imprisonment for Burglary.

	4.	Section 274 prescribes maximum sentence of 1 year for the offence of Common Assault.

	5.	According to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) the maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment.

	6.	The accepted tariff for Burglary is between 18 months and 3 years as held by Madigan J in State v Vikatore Tabeusi [2010] FJHC 426; HAC 095-113 of 2010L (16th September 2010) and State v Jese Mucunabitu [2010] FJHC 151; HAC 017 of 2010. (15th April 2010).

	7.	The tariff for Common Assault is with discretion of court and in most cases the sentence is suspended.

	8.	The tariff for Rape is well settled since the Judgment of then A.H.C.T. Gates J in State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a Rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.

	9.	In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed: 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

	1.	The accused person is not a first offender. However he does not have any previous conviction which is in the operational period. The State had confirmed this position.

	2.	Considering the nature of the offence and all other circumstances I impose 12 months sentence for the count of Burglary.

	3.	Considering the above and nature of the offence I impose 3 months imprisonment for each offence of Common Assault.

	4.	For each charge of Rape I commence your sentence at 10 years.

	5.	State had submitted following aggravating features:
		(a) The injuries caused to the victim,
		(b) The victim was 18 years old student while the accused was 36 years old,
		(c) The victim had to undergo the trauma twice on the same day.

	6.	As the accused is charged separately for the injuries caused to the victim and the two acts of Rape those cannot be considered as aggravating circumstances. However considering the young age of the victim I increase your sentence by 1 year. Now your sentence is 11 years.

	7.	The mitigating circumstances are:
		(a) You are remorseful.

	8.	Considering above I reduce 1 year of your sentence. Now your sentence is 10 years.

	9.	For your early guilty plea I deduct 3 years of your sentence. Now your sentence is 7 years.

	10.	For the time period in remand I reduce 7 months. Now your sentence is 6 years and 5 months.

	11.	All the offences stated above were committed in the course of same transaction. Considering the totality principle I order all sentences to run concurrently.

	12.	Acting under Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I fix 5 years as the period in which you are not eligible to be released on parole.

	13.	Having considered the nature of relationships you had with the victims, I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) in place, identifying both victims Ms. KLR and Ms. AD as the protected persons. You are hereby ordered not to have any sort of a contact with the victims directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this court. 

Summary

	1.	Your sentence is as follows:

1st count of Burglary 12 months
2nd count of Common Assault 3 months
3rd count of Common Assault 3 months

4th count of Common Assault 3 months
5th count of Rape 6 years and 5 months
6th count of Rape 6 years and 5 months

	1.	All the sentences to run concurrently. You are not eligible for parole for 5 years.

	2.	30 days to appeal.

Statement of Offence
 
 
MURDER: Contrary to section 237 of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
JOSUA COLANAUDOLU between the 13th day of March 2016 and 14th day of March 2016, at Navua in the Central Division, murdered MERE AILEVU MACEDRU.
  
• Mr. Josua Colanaudolu, the facts of your case was very disturbing. Although you are from Verata, Tailevu, you spent the most of your life at Lepanoni and Vunibuabua Settlements. You grew up in that area and knew the people and families who grew up in the area. When you were young, you represented Fiji in judo at international events. This was a good start for you as a role model for the youths in the area. However, unbeknown to the members of your community, you began to use your sporting power to prey on young girls in the area.
 
 
• Between the 1st April 1998 and 31 December 1999, at the age of 22 years old, you attacked the first complainant (PW2), who was a 14 year old girl at the time. She was tiny, and you were bigger and stronger than her. PW2 was sent to the shop by her parents. You waited for her among the flower gardens. When she came near you, you forcefully grabbed her, gagged her and forcefully took her to your house. There you subdued her forcefully and raped her. You warned her not to report on the incident, or you will kill her.
 
 
• You continually harassed PW2 until February 2000, and did the above incident to her 8 times. She was scared to report the matter until Mere Ailevu’s murder in 2016. Next you turned your attention on the second complainant (PW3). She was PW2’s elder sister. The sisters were your neighbour in the Vunibuabua/Lepanoni Settlement area. PW3 said sometimes between 1 June and 31 July 2002, she was breastfeeding her baby daughter in their family house. Her daughter was born on 30 May 2002. PW3 said, she was 20 years old at the time. You were 26 years old at the time.
 
 
• PW3 said, her parents were sleeping in the sitting room. It was night time. You entered their house without their permission. You forcefully took PW3 outside the house. When she wanted to raise the alarm, you put a knife to her throat and warned her not to do so, or you will injure her parents or baby daughter. You took her to an outside dog house. You threw her in the dog house, forcefully took off her clothes and forcefully raped her for about an hour. You fled the scene because you were disturbed by another. PW3 was so scared to report the incident to the authorities, until the Mere Ailevu’s murder case arose.
 
 
• Next you turned your attention on your niece, complainant no. 3 (PW4). PW4 was your elder brother’s daughter. On 16 November 2012, you tricked her that her father was looking for her. She was 18 years old at the time. You were 36 years old at the time. Instead of taking her to her father, your elder brother, you took her to the Deuba beach. At the beach, you forcefully subdued her and raped her for 20 minutes. She fainted as a result of the attack. You left her there, and fled the scene. All the above attacks on young women came to a head when you turned your attention on Mere Ailevu, a 14 year old girl. You were 39 years old at the time.
 
 
• Throughout the 13 March 2016 (Sunday) you had been drinking liquor with friends. You worked from 8pm on 12 March 2016 (Saturday) to 5am 13 March 2016 at Hide Tide Bar in Deuba. On 13 March 2016, you went home to have your dinner. You felt asleep while having your dinner. After 10pm, you woke up and wandered to the village market. You saw Mere Ailevu at the market. You forcefully took her across the Queens Highway towards the Loloma Beach side. You later threw her over the fence. Then you assaulted her by elbowing her. You forcefully carried her to the beach and repeatedly raped her vaginally and anally. You later left her there and fled the scene. Mere was found dead on the beach on Monday, 14 March 2016 in the afternoon. She died as a result of massive brain injuries.
 
 
• Parliament viewed the offence of murder as a serious one and had prescribed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (section 237 of the Crimes Act 2009). This is because the people of Fiji, through their representative in Parliament, viewed the unlawful taking of a person’s life as a serious matter, warranting a mandatory life imprisonment. However, Parliament had also given the courts, the power to fix a minimum term of imprisonment to be served, before the convict can apply to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji for a pardon (section 119 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji).
 
 
• Parliament also viewed the offence of rape, as a serious matter. They had prescribed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. However, the courts had set the tariff for the rape of a child a sentence between 10 to 16 years imprisonment: Anand Abhay Raj v The State, Criminal Appeal CAV 0003 of 2014, Supreme Court of Fiji. For the rape of an adult, the tariff is a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: See Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal. The final sentence will depend on the presence or otherwise of mitigating and/or aggravating factors.
 
 
• “Abduction” carried a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment (section 282 (c) of the Crimes Act 2009).
 
 
• “Indecently annoying females” carried a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment.
 
 
• The aggravating factors in this case were as follows: 
• (i) Your behaviour from the time you were 22 years old when you attacked complainant no. 1 (PW2) in 1998 to when you raped and killed Mere Ailevu in 2016, a period of 18 years, showed the personality of a depraved character. In a sense, you were the height of evil for those young women complainants. In fact, you qualify as a serial rapist. You are the worst nightmare for any parent who has a daughter. You showed no regard to the rights of those young women. You showed no mercy to them when you bullied them and raped them. You showed no mercy to Mere Ailevu, when you raped and murdered her, at the aged of 39 years old. The fact that you had a young daughter yourself did not help. You must not complaint when the court gives you the same mercy you gave PW2, PW3, PW4 and Mere Ailevu.
 
 
• (ii) By offending against the above female complainants, you had shown no regards to their rights as human beings and their right not to be harmed or abused. You had shown no regard to Mere Ailevu’s right to life.
 
 
• (iii) Furthermore, through your offendings, you had shown no regards to the rights of the victims’ family. They have a right to see that members of their families are not harmed and abused by people like you. You have caused them heartaches and sadness.
 
 
• (iv) You showed no remorse throughout the trial, even though you had a right to defend yourself according to law.
 

 
• The mitigating factor I can only find one, that is, you had been remanded in custody for 1 year 2 months.
 
 
• On count no. 12 (murder), I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment. Taking the factors mentioned in paragraph 12 and 13, I fix a minimum term of 30 years to be served before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
 
• On count no. 2 (rape). I start with a sentence of 13 years imprisonment. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 17 years imprisonment. I deduct 2 years for the time spend in remand. Balance is 15 years imprisonment.
 
 
• I repeat the above process and sentence for counts 4, 6, 8, 10 and 11 (all rape offences).
 
 
• For count no. 9 (abduction), I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment.
 
 
• For count no. 7 (indecently annoying females), I sentence you to 6 months imprisonment.
 
 
• The summary of your sentences are as follows: 
• (i) Murder (Count no. 12) : Mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 


 years to be served, before a pardon may be considered 
 
 by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
 
 (ii) Rape (Count no. 2) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14 
 years imprisonment.
 (iii) Rape (Count no. 4) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14 
 years imprisonment.
 (iv) Rape (Count no. 6) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14
 years imprisonment.
 
 (v) Rape (Count no. 8) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14 

 years imprisonment.
 
 (vi) Rape (Count no. 10) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14 

 years imprisonment.
 
 (vii) Rape (Count no. 11) : 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 14

 years imprisonment.
 
 (viii) Abduction (Count no. 9) : 5 years imprisonment.
 (ix) Indecently Annoying

 Females (Count no. 7) : 6 months imprisonment.
 
  
• Because of the totality principle of sentencing, all the above sentences are made concurrent to each other, that is, a final sentence of mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years to be served, before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.
 
• Mr. Josua Colanaudolu, for the rape and abuse of three young female complainants (PW2, PW3, PW4 and the abduction, rape and murder of Mere Ailevu, between the 1 April 1998 and 14 March 2016, I sentence you to the mandatory life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years imprisonment to be served, before a pardon may be considered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, effective forthwith.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the above sentence is designed to punish you in a manner which is just in all the circumstances, to deter other would-be offenders from preying on the young children of this country, who are the future of Fiji and to signify that the court and the community denounce what you did to the four female complainants between 1 April 1998 and 14 March 2016.
 
 
• You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Gates P:
 
 
1. I agree with the judgment and reasoning of Keith J, and with the orders proposed.
 
 
Chandra J:
 
 
2. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion in the judgment of Keith J.
Keith J:
 
 
Introduction
 
 
3. Criminal offences vary considerably in their gravity. Day in and day out magistrates and judges are called upon to determine whether a particular offence has aggravating features which would justify an enhancement of the sentence, and whether it has mitigating features which would justify a reduction in the sentence. This case illustrates how great care should be taken when the judge is considering the extent to which the sentence should be enhanced to reflect any aggravating features of the offence.
 
 
4. The petitioner is Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula. I shall refer to him as the defendant from now on. He was charged with one count of rape, and tried in the High Court in Suva. He pleaded not guilty. He was convicted by the trial judge, Bandara J, after each of the three assessors had expressed the opinion that he was guilty. He was sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years.
 
  
•  The defendant filed a notice of appeal. It purported to be a notice of appeal against both his conviction and his sentence. However, the grounds of appeal within the notice contained only grounds of appeal against conviction, and only one ground at that. When the notice of appeal came before the single judge, Goundar JA, he refused the defendant leave to appeal against his conviction. However, he was troubled by three aspects of the trial judge’s approach to sentence, and he gave the defendant leave to appeal against sentence. The Court of Appeal (Gamalath JA, Prematilaka JA and Temo JA) agreed with one of Goundar JA’s misgivings, and allowed the appeal, reducing the sentence to one of 12 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. The defendant contends that this reduction was insufficient, and he now applies to the Supreme Court for special leave to appeal against his sentence in order to get his sentence reduced further.
 

The facts
 
  
• The defendant and his wife were the wardens of a hostel for deaf children. It was a Christian establishment, and in addition to his duties as warden, the defendant gave the children biblical classes. There were about 12 girls living at the hostel at the relevant time. They called him “Daddy”. The complainant was one of the girls living at the hostel. She was 16 years old throughout the period during which she was abused. She was deaf and had a speech impediment.
  
•  Over a period of three months between April and June 2011, the defendant persuaded the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him six times. He relied on her naivety. He told her that he would teach her how to have sex so that she would be experienced in sexual matters when it came to satisfying her future husband. On the first occasion when it happened, the defendant went to the girl’s room in the early hours of the morning. He told her not to be afraid as he was her “daddy” and she was his daughter. He had to pull her thighs apart, but she eventually submitted to his demands because she was scared of what would happen to her if she did not. She experienced a considerable degree of pain. The same thing happened on other occasions, once in her bedroom again, once in the defendant’s bedroom when his wife (who was deaf herself) was asleep, once in his daughter’s bedroom, once in the living room and once in the defendant’s toilet.
 

 
•  The complainant did not tell anyone about the abuse of her at the time. It only came to light in 2012 when she told another teacher at the school about it. At his trial, the defendant did not deny having had sexual intercourse with the girl. His defence was that she had at all times consented to sexual intercourse with him. All he had been guilty of, he claimed, was adultery. By finding him guilty, the judge must be taken to have concluded that her submission to sexual intercourse had not amounted to her consent to it, and that she only submitted to it because she feared what might happen to her if she did not.
 
 
•  Finally, although there were six occasions when sexual intercourse took place, the charge which the defendant faced was a single charge of rape which was alleged to have taken place between 1 April and 30 June 2011. However, the prosecution’s case, as the judge pointed out to the assessors, was that this was a representative count. Indeed, that was what the amended information had said, and therefore it was not something which would have taken the defence by surprise. What impact that should have had on the sentencing process is something to which I shall have to return.
 

The trial judge’s reasoning
 
 
10. The trial judge took 8 years’ imprisonment as his starting point. He said that this was at the lower end of the appropriate range, but he decided to reflect the aggravating features as he saw them by enhancing the sentence in various stages. The judge regarded the fact that the defendant had been in a position of authority over the girl – a position which he had gravely abused – as a significant aggravating factor. He enhanced the starting point by three years for that reason. Next the judge thought that the deception which the defendant had practiced on the girl – by telling her that he was simply preparing her for marriage – was a serious breach of trust, which warranted an enhancement of the sentence by a further three years. Thirdly, the judge treated the defendant as opportunistic in the sense that he took advantage of her naivety, her disability and her unsophisticated rural background. For that he increased the starting point by another two years. Fourthly, the judge regarded as significant the fact that considerable planning must have gone into all this. For the fact that the defendant had at no time acted on the spur of the moment but had planned each occasion on which he had subjected the girl to his sexual demands, the judge enhanced the sentence by another year. Fifthly, the judge noted that the abuse had gone on for what he described as a “period of time” and involved “repeated ... sexual acts”. That justified adding a further year to the starting point. Finally, the judge noted the defendant’s complete lack of remorse. The girl had been required to relive her ordeal by giving evidence, and the only guilt the defendant was prepared to accept was that he had been unfaithful to his wife. For that, the judge added a further year. All of this came to 19 years. 
 
  
•  The only mitigation which the judge identified was that the defendant was a first offender with no previous convictions. He reduced the sentence which he would otherwise have passed by three years for that reason. Since the defendant had been on bail and had pleaded not guilty, there was no reason to reduce the sentence further. Accordingly, the judge sentenced him to 16 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years.
 

The approach of the Court of Appeal
 
  
•  The Court of Appeal thought that the trial judge had made an arithmetical error. It thought that the starting point of 8 years plus the various years which the judge had added for the aggravating features of the case came to 18, not 19, years. That was what had been submitted to it by the prosecution. Both the prosecution and the Court of Appeal were wrong. They had omitted in their calculation the one year which the trial judge had added for the length of time the abuse had gone on for. The Court of Appeal’s criticism of the trial judge in this respect was therefore misplaced.
 

13. The Court of Appeal’s other criticism of the trial judge reflected one of Goundar JA’s three concerns about the sentence passed on the defendant. That was that there had been a significant element of double-counting in his approach: he had, to use the words of Gamalath JA, “counted some of the aggravating features twice over”. Specifically, the Court of Appeal regarded the defendant’s abuse of authority and his breach of trust as overlapping. The two elements were so interconnected that they should have been treated as different sides of the same coin. Since each of those elements had resulted in the starting point being enhanced by three years (making six years in all), the remedy for that was to reduce the sentence by three years. If the trial judge had not made the arithmetical error which the Court of Appeal wrongly thought he had made, he would have passed a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment. That was why the Court of Appeal substituted a sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment (with a non-parole period of 11 years) for the sentence passed by the trial judge.
 
 
The grounds for leave to appeal
 
 
14. Only one ground is relied on by the defendant’s counsel in support of this application for special leave to appeal. That is that the trial judge ‘’erred in failing to consider the [defendant’s] family circumstance[s] and the likely effect the sentence will have on [his] family”. This contention is factually incorrect. The trial judge did consider the defendant’s family circumstances. In his sentencing remarks, he referred to the defendant’s three children and their ages, and he expressly acknowledged that if the defendant was to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the family would have no income and the effect of that on his family would be disastrous. If the point being made is that the judge did not treat that as mitigation, that would be correct. The judge expressly said that the only mitigation defendant had was his clean record.
 
  
•  This ground of appeal is new. It was not raised in the Court of Appeal. Indeed, not only is it now being raised for the first time; it was sprung on the prosecution and the court at the last moment. It first saw the light of day two days before the hearing in the Supreme Court when written submissions prepared on behalf of the defendant were filed. The defendant’s counsel, Miss S Nasedra, told us of the difficulty in getting instructions from the defendant. We did not explore with her what those difficulties were, but it is hardly satisfactory for the only ground of appeal to emerge in this way and so close to the date of the hearing.
 
 
•  As it is, I do not think that it can afford the defendant an arguable ground of appeal. The defendant was looking at a very long sentence come what may. Family circumstances may have an important part to play when the court is considering whether to pass a short custodial sentence or whether a non-custodial sentence might be justified. Strong mitigation about the effect of a sentence of imprisonment on the offender’s family will then be very important, and could make all the difference between a custodial sentence and a non-custodial one. Family circumstances will have less part to play in a case such as the present where the offender is going to be parted from his family for a long time in any event. When one looks at the case as a whole, the three years which the judge allowed for such mitigation as was available to the defendant was not too short.
 

The trial judge’s approach to the sentencing process
 
 
17. There are two features about the trial judge’s approach to the sentencing process which need to be addressed. Both raise fundamental questions about how a judge should approach the difficult task of sentencing an offender. The first relates to how a judge should choose his starting point for sentence. As I have said, the trial judge took 8 years’ imprisonment as his starting point, ending up with 19 years when the aggravating features had been taken into account. He did not explain why he took 8 years as his starting point. It was a surprising starting point to take as the judge himself said that the appropriate range of sentence for the offence of rape was 10-15 years’ imprisonment. Indeed, the gap between his starting point and where he ended up before considering the defendant’s personal mitigation is so large that it rather suggests that something has gone wrong somewhere. That difference would have been less stark if the judge had taken as his starting point somewhere within the appropriate range. 
 
 
18. But where within that range should the starting point have been? There is no problem when there is established authority for what the starting point should be. For example, in the past the starting point for the offence of rape was 7 years’ imprisonment. The problem arises when there is no established authority for the starting point, but instead an appropriate range of sentence (sometimes referred to as the tariff) has been identified. For example, the appropriate range of sentence for the rape of a child (ie someone under the age of 18) is 10-16 years’ imprisonment: see Anand Abhay Raj v The State [2014] FJSC 12 at [58]. Where within that range should the starting point be?
 
 
19. There is here a difference in judicial opinion. In Koroivuki v The State [2013] FJCA 15, Goundar JA said at [26]: “As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff.” On the other hand, a number of trial judges choose the lower end of the range as a matter of routine. For example, in Jemesa Gaunavinaka v The State [2017] FJHC 425, Perera J said at [24] that “the starting point of a particular offence should be construed as the minimum period of imprisonment a particular offence should attract”. 
 
 
20. This difference of approach has to be resolved at some stage, but this is not the time to do so. The issue was understandably not raised by the defence: they were content with the fact that the judge had taken as his starting point, not just a term at the lower end of the range, but well below even that. Nor was it raised by the prosecution, no doubt because they were content to address the only ground of appeal relied on by the defence. The issue is one which requires careful and mature consideration, with the benefit of help from counsel, and neither of them were in a position to address the issue when it was tentatively raised by the court. I simply highlight it now to show that it needs to be engaged at some stage. 
 
  
•  The second feature about the judge’s approach to the sentencing process which needs to be addressed is whether it is appropriate for the amount by which an offender’s sentence is to be increased for each of the aggravating factors should be identified. The judge in this case enhanced the sentence in six separate stages, identifying the size of the increase at each stage: (i) three years for the abuse of authority; (ii) three years for the breach of trust; (iii) two years for the opportunistic nature of the abuse; (iv) one year for the planning; (v) one year for the length of time the abuse lasted; and (vi) one year for the defendant’s lack of remorse. This is too mechanistic an approach. Sentencing is an art, not a science, and doing it in the way the judge did risks losing sight of the wood for the trees. 
 
 
•  The danger is twofold. The first is that you ignore the bigger picture. It would have been less objectionable if the judge had then stood back and asked himself whether 19 years’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence subject to the defendant’s personal mitigation, but he did not do that. The risk of passing too heavy a sentence would have been lessened had the judge stood back and asked himself whether the sentence he had in mind subject to personal mitigation fitted the crime. I shall return to that later on. The second danger in the judge’s approach is that you run the risk of sentencing the offender twice over for the same thing. That is what happened here. There was a strong element of double counting, the most obvious example of that being the one which the Court of Appeal identified. Another is that opportunistically taking advantage of the girl’s vulnerability was merely an aspect of the defendant’s abuse of authority and his breach of trust. The danger of double counting would have been less if the judge had not assigned particular periods of imprisonment to each of the aggravating factors.
 

Lack of remorse
 
 
23. One of Goundar JA’s other concerns was the one year by which the trial judge had enhanced the defendant’s sentence for his lack of remorse. The Court of Appeal did not address that. We do not know why. It addressed Goundar JA’s concern about the possibility of double-counting even though there had been no application for leave to appeal against sentence. As it is, lack of remorse is not an aggravating factor. Not being sorry about what you have done does not make what you have done any the worse. It just means that you forfeit whatever chances you may have had for a more lenient sentence. The trial judge should therefore not have enhanced the defendant’s sentence for the defendant’s lack of remorse.
 
 
A single offence?
 
  
•  I have already referred to the fact that the defendant faced a single count of rape, alleged to have been committed between the beginning of April and the end of June 2011. But since it was a representative count, relating to a course of conduct in which he raped the complainant six times during that period, the question arises as to how that affects the sentencing process. The judge sentenced the defendant on the basis that he had raped the complainant a number of times. Was he entitled to do that, or should he have sentenced the defendant on the basis that he had been convicted on one count of rape only? That was the third of Goundar JA’s misgivings about the judge’s approach, but unfortunately the Court of Appeal did not address it.
 
 
•  The law on the topic is clear. Where an offender is convicted on a single count, he may not be sentenced on the basis that he was guilty of other offences of a similar nature unless he has admitted that he was guilty. A court is not permitted to base its decision about the appropriate sentence on the commission of offences which did not form part of the offence for which the defendant was convicted. Indeed, the fact that the count on which the defendant was convicted was described by the prosecution as a representative count did not entitle the judge to sentence him as if he had been found guilty of other offences not included in the indictment. That is the effect of a series of decisions in England: R v Burfoot (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 252, R v Clark [1996] 2 Cr App R (S) 351 and R v Canavan [1998] 1 Cr App R (S) 79. 
 
 
•  The upshot is that if the prosecution wants an offender to be sentenced for the whole of his offending, there have to be separate counts in the information for each of the offences. It has been said that where the offender is alleged to have committed multiple crimes of the same type against the same victim, it would be awkward to have a number of separate counts in the information all in the same terms. That is not a problem. Take this case as an example. The particulars of the offence in the only count which the defendant faced were (leaving out those details which might result in the complainant being identified):
 

“Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2011 at xxx had carnal Knowledge of xxx without her consent.”
 
 
The next count could then have read:
 
 
“Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula on an occasion other than that referred to in count 1 between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2011 at xxx had carnal knowledge of xxx without her consent.”
 
 
The remaining counts could then have been drafted in the same way.
 
 
The appropriate sentence
 
  
•  In the circumstances, it is necessary for us to consider whether a different sentence should be passed in place of the sentence which the Court of Appeal substituted for that of the trial judge. Without deciding as a matter of principle where that starting point should be in a case where there is an appropriate range of sentence, we proceed in this case on the basis that the starting point here should be at the lower end of the appropriate range, namely 10 years’ imprisonment. It should not be forgotten that even that is a substantial sentence, and reflects many of the features which make the rape of a child particularly serious. 
 
 
•  Having said that, though, this was a serious offence of its kind. The defendant was 35 years old at the time. He persuaded a naïve and vulnerable girl of 16 to have sexual intercourse with him by a dishonest subterfuge, knowing that she was unhappy about what he was doing to her, causing her considerable pain, taking advantage of her trust in him and grotesquely abusing his authority. He has to be treated for the purpose of sentence as having done that just the once, but whereas the loss of her virginity should have been an occasion which she would remember with love or at least affection, she has been robbed of one of the great joys of life. On the other hand, although the defendant achieved his end by deception, no violence was used, and although there was no question of the complainant having consented to sexual intercourse, this was a case of her submitting to sexual intercourse rather than being forced by the use or threat of violence to engage in it. In my opinion, when you take the aggravating and mitigating features of the defendant’s conduct into account, the starting point should be enhanced by three years. 
 
 
•  The only factor relating to the defendant which could amount to mitigation is that he was a first time offender, but that cannot be significant mitigation in this case since it was because he was a man of good character that he was entrusted with the responsible position of warden of a hostel for deaf children. I would discount his sentence by one year to reflect that fact. Accordingly, although I disagree with the route by which the Court of Appeal arrived at what it thought was the appropriate sentence, I agree with the outcome which the Court of Appeal proposed, including the non-parole period of 11 years.
 
 
•  I should add just one thing to that. It is always useful for the judge to stand back at the end of the process to see whether the sentence he proposes to pass feels right. Judges tend to develop a strong sense of what the appropriate sentence should be. Asking themselves at the end of the process whether the sentence they propose to pass feels right is a sensible way for the judge to check whether the decision which he has reached by a more analytical process is likely to be correct. Had the trial judge done that, it may be that he would not have passed a sentence which was as long as the one he ended up passing.
 

Conclusion
 
 
31. This case has involved substantial questions of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice, namely the proper approach to be adopted when selecting the starting point for sentence for an offence for which an appropriate range of sentence has been identified, and when an offence has a number of aggravating features. I would therefore grant the defendant special leave to appeal against his sentence. In accordance with the Supreme Court’s usual practice, I would treat the hearing of the application for special leave to appeal as the hearing of the appeal, but for the reasons I have endeavoured to give, I would dismiss the appeal.
 
 
Orders: 
 
 
 (1) Application for special leave to appeal against sentence granted.
 (2) Appeal against sentence dismissed.
 (3) Sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years affirmed.

 INTRODUCTION
 
  
• The Appellant filed this appeal against the conviction and sentence. 
 
 
• The Appellant was charged in the Magistrates Court of Lautoka with one count of ‘Indecent Assault’ contrary to Section 212 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The Complainant was Appellant’s granddaughter.
 
 
• The Appellant was convicted of the charge after a full trial and on 14th November, 2016, the learned Magistrate sentenced the Appellant to 18 months’ imprisonment.
 
 
• The Appellant has filed a Notice of Appeal against the conviction and sentence within time.
 

5. FACTS ACCEPTED BY THE TRIAL MAGISTRTAE 
 
 
The Complainant is Appellant’s granddaughter. She was 12 years old at the time of the incident. On the 04th February 2015, she was staying at Appellant’s place. When she was lying down on a bed Appellant came and sat beside her. Appellant put his hand inside her top and touched her breasts. Then he touched her private parts on top of her cloths. Appellant asked her how she feels when he touched her breasts. The Complainant started crying and she informed her sister about the incident. Later they informed about the incident to their father and the matter was reported to the Police. 
 
 
6. GROUNDS OF APPEAL
 
 
 CONVICTION
 
  
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the evidence if the complainant/witness who were juveniles and as such proper direction ought to have been given regarding taking oath;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in not taking into consideration the Appellant’s submission on ‘no case to answer‘ at the end of Prosecution case. He also did not apply the relevant laws to the facts that were presented by the State;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing and misdirecting that the prosecution evidence before the court proved beyond reasonable that there were serious doubts in the prosecution case and as such the benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the Appellant;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate failed to direct himself on the question of burden of proof in that the Prosecution has proved all the allegation against the Appellant beyond all reasonable doubts;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not properly analyzing all facts before him before he made a decision that the Appellant was guilty as charged on the charge of indecent assault;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the possible defence on evidence;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering and/or rejecting the evidence of defence witnesses that were called by the defence;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give proper weight as to when the date of the complaint was made by the complainant against the Appellant and to say “that it appears the witnesses have given their statements to the police soon after the incident” raised serious doubt in the prosecution case;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not adequately directing himself to the significance of prosecution witnesses conflicting evidence during the trial;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into adequate consideration the evidence if all the defence witnesses in deciding that the Appellant was guilty of the offence charged.
 

SENTENCE
 
  
• Sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principal in all circumstances of the case;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the Appellant and not taking relevant matters into consideration;
 
 
• Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in denying the Appellant his right to mitigation of sentence.
 

ANALYSIS
 
 
 Ground 1 
 
 
Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not directing himself to the evidence if the complainant/witness who were juveniles and as such proper direction ought to have been given regarding taking oath;
 
  
• At the trial, Prosecution called two witnesses, the victim (12) and her sister (11) both of whom were children within the meaning of the Juveniles Act at the time they gave evidence. 
 
 
• As per the record, both child witnesses gave sworn evidence. The trial Magistrate, before proceeding to record their evidence under oath, did not hold a competency test to ascertain whether the child witnesses understood the nature and solemnity of the oath. 
 
 
• The Counsel for Appellant submits that the trial Magistrate did not comply with Section 10 (1) of the Juveniles Act and fell into error when he found the Appellant guilty on evidence of child witnesses whose evidence was not tested against competency. 
 
 
• Section 10 (1) of the Juveniles Act provides as follows:
 

“Where in any proceedings against any person for any offence or in any civil proceedings any child of tender years called as a witness does not in the opinion of the court understand the nature of an oath, his evidence may proceed not on oath, if, in the opinion of the court, he is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth; and the evidence though not given on oath but otherwise taken and reduced into writing so as to comply with any law in force for the time being, shall be deemed to be a deposition within the meaning of any law so in force:
 
 
Provided that where evidence is admitted by virtue of this section on behalf of the prosecution, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless that evidence is corroborated.
 
  
• There is a requirement under Section 10, that a child witness of tender years should be subjected to a competence inquiry where he or she is required to demonstrate an understanding of the nature and solemnity of an oath. The oath test required children to express knowledge of the fact that they would be committing a sin and ""burn in the fires of hell"" if they lied on oath (R v Brasier (1779) 168 Eng. Rep. 202 (K.B.). 
 
 
• If the child witness passes the oath test, he is competent to give sworn evidence, but his or her evidence is still subjected to the common law warning of corroboration. If the child witness fails the competency test, the trial court can record unsworn ‘evidence’ if it was satisfied that the child witness possessed sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of evidence and understood the duty of speaking the truth. However, the accused is not liable to be convicted on unsworn evidence unless that evidence is corroborated.
 
• The effects of section 10 were clearly explained by Shameem J in Agnu v  State  unreported Criminal Appeal No. HAA067 of 2008; 5 September 2008 at p5:
 

""The law on the evidence of children is that where a child gives unsworn evidence, corroboration is required as a matter of law. That means that without corroboration, a conviction is impossible. Where however a child gives sworn evidence, a corroboration warning should be given as a matter of practice on the basis that the evidence of children may be unreliable without some supporting evidence independent of the child and implicating the accused"".
 
  
• A careful examination of case law in Fiji would indicate that up until the landmark judgment of State v. AV [2009] FJHC 18; HAC192.2008 (2 February 2009), the courts in Fiji had strictly applied the rules of evidence concerning children of tender years as was provided in Section 10 of the Juveniles Act and the failure to hold an inquiry into the competency of a child witness had resulted in the conviction being quashed (Lal Khan (1981) 73 Cr App R 190, Fazal Mohammed v the State (1990) 91 Cr App R 256, C. A. Z. (1990) 91 Cr App R 203, Suresh Chand v R Ltk Cr App No. 77/83, Kepueli Jitoko v the State [1991] 37 FLR 14, Mohammed Salim Nur Khan v The State Cr App No. HAA004 of 2008). 
 
 
• The High Court in AV (supra), held that section 10 of the Juveniles Act, Cap. 56 and the common law requirement for corroboration and competency test for child witnesses unfairly discriminated against children on the ground of age and deprived them equality before the law as guaranteed by the Constitution Amendment Act 1997 (the 1997 Constitution). Therefore, the Court considered Section 10 of the Juveniles Act as ‘stricken from the said Act’. 
 
 
• In AV (supra), the victim was called to give evidence at the magistracy. Before receiving her evidence, the trial Magistrate did not carry out a competency inquiry as was required by Section 10 of the Juveniles Act Cap. 56. The trial Magistrate believed the victim's evidence and convicted the offender. The case was then transferred to the High Court for sentence. The High Court confirmed the correctness of the conviction and sentenced the offender. 
 
 
• The same issue arose before the Court of Appeal in the case of Kumar v State [2015] FJCA 32; AAU0049.2012 (4 March 2015), which was decided under the present Constitution where a similar equality provision has been incorporated. Section 26(1) of the Constitution states:
 

""Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection, treatment and benefit of the law"".
 
  
• Endorsing the sentiments expressed in AV (supra), and having analyzed the case law in England and Canada, the Court of Appeal (Gounder JA) observed: 
 

We endorse the above remarks. Every child in Fiji now has a constitutional right to be protected from abuse or any form of violence. This right is expressly provided by section 41 (1) (d) of the Constitution. Rape is the worst kind of sexual abuse that can be inflicted on a child. The courts have a constitutional duty to protect the children from any form of sexual abuse by taking into consideration matters that are in their best interests. Section 41 (2) of the Constitution states:
 
 
""The best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child."" 
 
...In our judgment, any law that restricts child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization cannot be regarded as being in the child's best interests and is inconsistent with the children's right to equality before the law. There is a growing recognition that child sexual abuse is often perpetrated by family members, close family friends or trusted community figures. In these circumstances, corroboration, that is, independent evidence implicating the accused to the alleged sexual abuse will rarely exist. The competency inquiry and the requirement for corroboration for child witnesses have no legitimate purpose in criminal proceedings involving children as victims of sexual abuse. Both the competency inquiry and requirement for corroboration for child witnesses in criminal proceedings are invalid under section 2(2) of the Constitution” 
 
  
• The object of this interpretation was to apply to children the ordinary test of competence regardless of any real or notional additional test previously imposed on them if they gave sworn or unsworn evidence, such as a requirement to determine whether the child understands nature and solemnity of the oath and the special importance of telling the truth in a court in addition to his or her duty to do so as part of normal social conduct.
 
 
• However in Kumar (supra), Calanchini P, had some reservations about the need to give corroboration warning. His Lordship acknowledged that evidence of the child witness did not have to be corroborated, but he said that a warning about the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child should still be required if the child does not understand the nature of the oath. Calanchini P concluded his judgment by saying that “children, especially young children, are still young children with all the frailties that are associated with childhood”.
 
• The Supreme Court in Kumar v State [2016] FJSC 44; CAV0024.2016 (27 October 2016) held that the requirement in Section 10 of the Juveniles Act that unsworn evidence of a child witness has to be corroborated is unconstitutional and therefor invalid. 
 

22. It was further observed: 
 
 
“In other jurisdictions, a child’s evidence is given unsworn. That has been the position in England in respect of children under the age of 14 since 1988: see section 33A (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. That recognizes that the form in which the evidence is given is far less important than the child’s ability to understand the questions they are being asked, to give answers which can be understood, and to appreciate the need to tell the truth. Giving evidence in court can be an intimidating experience even for adults, and requiring a child to take the oath could serve to increase their discomfort. In my opinion, therefore, it is far more appropriate for a child to give evidence unsworn, and for the distinction in section 10(1) of the Juveniles Act between the sworn and unsworn evidence of a child to be abolished, as has occurred in England”
 
  
• Of the requirement to conduct a “competence inquiry”, the Supreme Court observed: 
 

“The same applies to the existing requirement for a judge to conduct a “competence inquiry” before the child gives evidence to ascertain whether, to use the language of section 10(1), the child “is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth”.
 
In my opinion, the more appropriate course is to follow what has been the practice in England for almost 30 years, and to leave it to the judge to decide whether to conduct a “competence inquiry” before the child gives evidence, and for the requirement in section 10(1) of the Juveniles Act that the judge must do so to be abolished, although again I can only give effect to that view if that requirement is inconsistent with the Constitution.
 
  
• Of the requirement of giving corroboration warning, the Supreme Court observed: 
 

The same also applies, albeit with one refinement, to the warning to the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child...
 
...The more appropriate course is to follow what again has been the practice in England for almost 30 years, and for the requirement at common law for the judge to warn the assessors of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child to be abolished.
 
  
• The Supreme Court was not prepared to accept the proposition that the practice to give corroboration warning and the obligation to hold a competence inquiry discriminated against children. The Court observed:
 

“It also follows that I am in respectful disagreement with Goundar JA’s judgment in the Court of Appeal that the “competence inquiry” which the judge is required by section 10(1) to conduct before a child can give evidence, and the requirement at common law for a warning of the danger of convicting a defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of a child, are inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid. However, whether the requirement for a warning of this kind should remain part of the common law is another matter. For the reasons given in [33] above, I believe that Fiji should follow the path taken in England many years ago, and treat that requirement as no longer representing part of our common law. Accordingly, the fact that the trial judge did not give the assessors that warning does not undermine Kumar’s conviction. Having said that, there may be some cases in which the trial judge thinks that a warning of this kind is desirable. That may have something to do with the nature of the child’s evidence, or the way it was given, or it may have something to do with the assessors themselves. The trial judge is in the best position to assess that. So although there should no longer be any requirement on trial judges to give a warning of this kind, they may do so if they think that it is appropriate in a particular case... 
 
 
 ...The same is true of the inquiry which the judge is required to conduct to determine, before the child gives evidence, whether the child can give unsworn evidence, namely whether the child “is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth”. I do not see how such a requirement discriminates against children. Whether the witness is a child or an adult, the judge always has to assess the witness’ competence to give evidence. A child may not be mature enough to give evidence, in just the same way as an adult may have a mental disorder which makes him incompetent as a witness. So the need for the judge to determine whether a particular witness understands the questions they are asked, or is able to answer those questions in a way which can be understood, or appreciates the need to tell the truth, applies just as much to adults as it does to children. Section 10(1) does no more than to emphasize the need for that when the witness is a child.
 
  
• However, the Supreme Court did not disagree with the proposition that a requirement in any law restricting child victims of sexual abuse or violence from testifying about their victimization is in conflict with the child’s best interests.
 
 
• Gounder JA in AV (supra) referred to rights which the Constitution affords to children. His Lordship referred to Article 41(1) (d) of the Constitution which affirms the right of every child to be protected from abuse and also to Article 41 (2) of the Constitution which states ""The best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child."" 

28. The Supreme Court in Kumar (supra) concluded: 
 
“that the trial judge should have determined before the child witness gave evidence whether he or she could give sworn evidence. If he had decided that she could not, he should then have determined whether she could give unsworn evidence”. 
 
However, failure to do those things does not mean that the conviction of the defendant has to be quashed. (emphasis added)
 
29. In its concluding remarks, the Supreme Court observed:
 
As Goundar J noted in both his judgment in AV at [19] and in his judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case at [22], there have been many cases in which the failure of the judge to inquire into the competency of the child to give evidence, whether sworn or unsworn, has resulted in the conviction being quashed. With some diffidence, I question this line of authority – at any rate in its application to this case. I do not believe that the assessors were less likely to accept the girl’s evidence if it had been unsworn than if it had been sworn. And if it had been apparent to the trial judge in the course of the girl’s evidence that she did not satisfy the conditions for giving even unsworn evidence, he would have directed the assessors to disregard her evidence. The fact that he did not do that means that he must have thought that she was intelligent enough to understand that she had to tell the truth. In the circumstances, despite the trial judge not having done what section 10(1) required him to do, no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred (emphasis added)
 
  
• In the present case the child witnesses were 12 and 11 years of age. Once the witnesses had begun to testify, the trial Magistrate would have made them incompetent witnesses if they appeared to him to be of unsound mind, incoherent or lacking communication skills. The trial Magistrate did not do that. He, having carefully listened to the evidence, appears to have proceeded on the assumption (a fair assumption in the light of the trial magistrate’s decision to allow the girls to be sworn) that the witnesses had sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the oath. 
 
 
• I am of the view that the failure on the part of the Magistrate to hold the competence inquiry at the beginning of child witnesses’ testimony did not prejudice the Appellant. 
 
 
• Two child witnesses in this case gave evidence under oath. Therefore, question of giving corroboration warning arises only if that requirement is still valid in Common law. The Common law rule that evidence of child witness (whether sworn or unsworn) need to be corroborated has now been abolished.
 
 
• However, if the trial Magistrate had formed the view that child witnesses were not possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of their evidence and that they did not understand the duty of speaking the truth then the law predates AV judgment required, as a matter of law, evidence of the victim to be corroborated if the witnesses gave unsworn evidence. 
 
 
• Corroboration is evidence independent of the witness to be corroborated which confirms in some material particular not only that the crime was committed but that the accused committed it (R v Baskerville (1910) 2 KB 658).
 
 
• In the present case, the victim was in fact corroborated in material particular by her sister. Victim’s sister said that she was playing outside with her small sister and when she was crossing a room inside the house she saw the grandfather (Appellant) touching her sister’s private parts and asking if she liked it. She said that she saw her sister crying. Therefore, assuming that common law requirement to give corroboration warning with regard to sworn evidence as enunciated in Agnu v  State (supra) is still applicable, failure to conduct the competency test did not prejudice the Appellant because the child victim was corroborated in material particular. Therefor, even if the the obligation on the Magistrate to be satisfied at the beginning that the child had the necessary capacity to give evidence is still valid in Fiji, the trial Magistrate did not fell into error because child victim’s evidence was corroborated by her sister on material particular. 
 
 
• In the case of State v A.V (supra) the learned High Court Judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness, the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has, is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence.
 
 
• The Court of Appeal in Chand v State [2016] FJCA 20; AAU065.2011 (26 February 2016) held that the obligation on the part of the magistrate or the judge to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence would amount to a violation of section 26(1) of the Constitution: (at paragraph 15 to 19) 
 

“Counsel for the Appellant had sought to place reliance on the High Court case of The State v A.V, [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192 of 2008 (21 February 2009) which he states was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in the case of Rahul Ravinesh Kumar v The State; Criminal Appeal No AAU0049 of 2012. In the case of The State v A.V the learned High Court Judge had stated that when a child of a tender age appears in court as a witness, the only obligation the magistrate or the judge has, is to remind the child of the importance of telling the truth before receiving his or her evidence. I have examined this decision and find this had been stated by way of obiter. This undoubtedly is a good practice but it cannot be said that the failure to do so was fatal to the conviction of the Appellant. To hold otherwise would amount to a violation of section 26(1) of the Constitution, which states: ""Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law"". Section 26(3) of the Constitution prohibits unfair discrimination against a person directly or indirectly on the ground of age. Section 26(7) of the Constitution states treating one person differently from another on any of the grounds prescribed under subsection (3) is discrimination, unless it can be established that the difference in treatment is not unfair in the circumstances. Section 26(8) prescribes circumstances under which the right to equality and freedom from discrimination can be derogated but none of those circumstances apply to the evidence of children of tender years.
 
  
• In light of this Judgment, failure on the part of the trial Magistrate to remind the child witnesses of their duty to tell the truth is not a fatal irregularity. 
 
 
• I am of the view that the Appellant was accorded due process before he was convicted on the child witness’s valid testimony. I conclude that the trial Magistrate's decision to disregard section 10 of the Juveniles Act is in the best interest of the child guaranteed under the Constitution. This ground of appeal therefore should fail.
 

 Ground 2
 
  
• According to the Court Copy Record at page 23 and 24, as soon as the prosecution case was closed, Counsel for the Appellant informed court that she wished to summon the mother of the complainant to give evidence. By saying this, she appears to have accepted that there was a case to answer on the available evidence. Hence she did not make an application or submission in support of ‘no case to answer’. Appellant cannot complain now that he was not given the opportunity to make an application for no case to answer or any submission in its support.
 
 
• There was no submission made by the Appellant on no case to answer at the end of the prosecution case. Therefore, the claim that the learned Magistrate failed to consider her submission on no case to answer does not hold water. 
 
• Moreover, Sections 178 and 179 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 clearly state that the court has to determine the evidence at the end of prosecution case and then inform the accused of his rights after reading the charge to him again.
 

43. Relevant part of Sections 178 and 179 read as follows:
 
178. If at the close of the evidence in support of the charge it appears to the court that a case is not made out against the accused person sufficiently to require him or her to make a defence, the court shall dismiss the case and shall acquit the accused. 

 
179 (1) At the close of the evidence in support of the charge, if it appears to the court that a case is made out against the accused person sufficiently to require the making of a defence, the court shall .......
 
  
• The test applicable in the Magistrates Court is whether, taken at its highest, a reasonable court could convict on the Prosecution case. At the close of the prosecution case, there was ample evidence before court against the Appellant sufficient a reasonable court could convict on the Prosecution case. Therefore, trial Magistrate’s decision to read out the charge and put the Appellant to his defence did not violate the procedural requirement of the law. 
 

Ground 3 & 9
 
  
• There is no submission before this court of what is the ‘serious doubt’ as was claimed by the Appellant. Nor is there any submission before this court to be considered that prosecution witnesses gave conflicting evidence during the trial. I considered the evidence given by two prosecution witnesses and found no material contradiction sufficient enough to discredit the version of the Prosecution. These grounds are incomplete and not substantiated by the Appellant.
 
 
• In any event, the learned trial Magistrate has quite clearly said in his Judgment that the prosecution case was consistent and reliable as compared to the defence witnesses who were inconsistent. There is no merit in these grounds. 
 

 Ground 4
 
  
• At paragraph 4 of the Judgment, the learned Magistrate set out that it is the prosecution’s duty to prove the offence against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no basis for the claim of the Appellant that the learned Magistrate did not direct himself to the law on burden of proof.
 
 
• The Appellant submits that by stating that “the defence could not challenge the evidence given by the Prosecution...” the learned Magistrate shifted the burden to the defence to prove his innocence. I do not find any basis for this submission. 
 
 
• Trial Magistrate at the close of the prosecution case only had the prosecution version and therefore one side of the story. Upon being satisfied that there is a case to answer, the court is required to give an opportunity to the accused to tell his side of the story and also attack the credibility of the version of the Prosecution. In the process of evaluating evidence of the defence, the court is required to assess the credibility of the evidence adduced by the defence. 
 
 
• In this case, the learned Trial Magistrate stated with the words highlighted by the Appellant that evidence adduced by the defence did not damage the prosecution case or challenge the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. Ultimately, the court accepted that Prosecution has proved the offence beyond reasonable doubt. This ground has no merit and should be dismissed. 
 

Grounds 5, 6, 7 & 10
 
 
  
• These grounds are misconceived and have no basis. The Trial Magistrate in his judgment has clearly narrated in individual paragraphs the evidence of all the defence witnesses.
 
 
• Furthermore, the trial Magistrate then analyzed the defence evidence and came to the conclusion that he does not accept the defence version. He also provided reasons for doing so.
 
 
• I find the evidence of the Appellant self serving. Witnesses called by the Defence contradicted each other. The learned trial Magistrate has highlighted those contradictions and has given due consideration to inconsistencies when he decided to disbelieve the version of the Defence.
 

Ground 8 
 
  
• Appellant contends that the learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give proper weight as to when the date of the complaint was made by the complainant against the Appellant and to say “that it appears the witnesses have given their statements to the police soon after the incident” raised serious doubt in the prosecution case.
 
 
• Counsel for Appellant submits that the Prosecution did not have evidence of the date of the alleged offence and learned Magistrate’s above mentioned statement is mere speculation. 
 
 
• Prosecution has led evidence of the complainant on the basis that the alleged incident occurred between the 2nd day of February and 4th February 2015. (Page 17 of the copy record) The Defence Counsel has cross examined the complainant on the basis that the incident occurred on the 2nd day of February 2015. When the sister of the Complainant (Aaliya) was giving evidence the Defence Counsel cross examined her on the basis that she made her statement to police on 3rd day of February 2015. Therefore, there was concrete evidence before the trial Magistrate that the complaint was made soon after the incident. There is no basis for this ground and therefore should fail.

 
APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• First two grounds have been advanced on the basis that the sentence is harsh and excessive and wrong in principal. Therefore, grounds 1 and 2 can be considered together.
 
 
• This Court will approach an appeal against sentence using principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2].  
 
 
• In Bae v State [1999] FJCA 21; AAU0015u.98s (26 February 1999) the Fiji Appeal Court observed:
 

“It is well established law that before this Court can disturb the sentence, the appellant must demonstrate that the Court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some relevant consideration, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499)”.
 
  
• The Supreme Court, in Naisua v State [2013] FJSC 14; CAV0010.2013 (20 November 2013), endorsed the views expressed in Bae (supra):
 

“It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentence using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No.AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
 
 (i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
 
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
(iii) Mistook the facts;
 
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration. 
 
  
• The Fiji Court of Appeal in Sharma v State [unreported Cr. App. No. AAU0065 of 2012; 2 June 2014] discussed the approach to be taken when exercising appellate jurisdiction in reviewing a sentencing discretion of a lower court. The Court observed: 
 

“In determining whether the sentencing discretion has miscarried this Court does not rely upon the same methodology used by the sentencing judge. The approach taken by this Court is to assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the sentence is one that could reasonably be imposed by a sentencing judge or, in other words, that the sentence imposed lies within the permissible range. It follows that even if there has been an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court will still dismiss the appeal if in the exercise of its own discretion the Court considers that the sentence actually imposed falls within the permissible range. However, it must be recalled that the test is not whether the Judges of this Court if they had been in the position of the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence. It must be established that the sentencing discretion has miscarried either by reviewing the reasoning for the sentence or by determining from the facts that it is unreasonable or unjust”
 
  
• Tariff for indecent assault was set out in Rakota v State [2002] FJHC 168; HAA0068J.2002S (23 August 2002).

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was used, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.
 
These are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff, although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate. A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guidelines than these.
  
• This tariff has been accepted for the same offence under the Crimes Decree, 2009 as well. State v Mario [2014] FJHC 935; HAC 70 & 71.2013 (19 December 2014).
 
 
• The Appellant received 18 months’ imprisonment for indecently assaulting his granddaughter who was 12 years old. Considering the circumstances, especially the aggravating features such as the age gap and breach of trust, the Appellant has received a very lenient sentence.
 
 
• The Appellant claims that he was not given an opportunity to file his mitigation. However, the court copy record shows otherwise. The Appellant and his Counsel were given two opportunities to file mitigation; obviously the court cannot adjourn and wait indefinitely for the Appellant to file his mitigation. Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate gave due consideration to his old age and his clear record in his mitigation.
 
 
• As regards the 3rd ground against sentence, the Appellant has not specifically mentioned what relevant matters the sentencing Magistrate failed to take into consideration and what irrelevant matters he considered in coming to his final sentence. There are no merits in these grounds and should be dismissed.
 
 
• Sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate is neither excessive nor unreasonable. Therefore, I affirm the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. 
 
 
• For reasons given in this judgment, the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

Particulars of Offence

ROSHAN ALI s/o KURBAN ALI on the 30th day of October 1997 at Meigunyah, Nadi in the Western Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of MATELITA LEWADUA DERENALAGI without her consent.

He was sentenced to a total of 7 years imprisonment. He now appeals against conviction and sentence.

The facts

The trial commenced on 15th January 2001. The Appellant was represented by counsel. PW1 was Dr Prem Chand, Medical Assistant Rakiraki. He said that on 31st October 1997 he attended to Matelita Derenalagi who was brought in to Nadi Hospital by the police. She told him that she had been raped by an Indian man at 9pm. She looked drowsy. Her physical condition was good but she had injuries. There was a small bruise on the right thigh, and abrasions at the opening of the vagina. There was a white discharge on the vaginal opening. There was bleeding under the skin on the inner right thigh and the right upper inner thigh was bruised with bleeding under the skin. There were redness and abrasions on both sides of the vaginal opening and there was a bruise on the posterior of the vagina. He found that the injuries were caused by the forceful entry of the vagina. He said that the complainant was unsteady in her gait because she was drowsy. He said that the injuries could have been caused by rape or by the forceful entry of a finger into the vagina.

The complainant gave evidence that she was born on the 28th of October 1981 and was in Form Five in 1997. She said that on the 30th of October 1997 at 7pm she was on her way to the bus stop from the Food for Less Supermarket. She saw the accused. She knew him because he was married to a Fijian woman. He offered to drop her home in his carrier. There was a Fijian boy in the vehicle and the Appellant told him to sit at the back so the complainant could sit in the front passenger seat. The complainant then sat in the front. The Appellant was driving. The Appellant then drove to Votualevu Roundabout where he dropped the Fijian boy. He then drove to the back road. He asked the complainant if she smoked marijuana. She said she had only tried it once. He then dropped her on the road to his house so he could buy marijuana. She waited for him. He picked her up again and followed the back road to a place where a tram line crossed the road. He then asked the complainant to smoke the marijuana.

The complainant said she would only smoke a little because she was sick. She did so. She said her head was spinning and that the Appellant wanted her to inhale his smoke. She was coughing and felt weak. The Appellant then said that he wanted her. She said she did not want him, and wanted to go home.

The record then reads as follows:

“He wanted to have sex with me. Accused stood up and forced me to kiss him. He did not stand up but shifted towards me. He also kissed me. He grabbed me I pushed him away. I was weak at the time. He took off his shirt. I was in my school uniform – grey with button in front.

The accused shifted to where I sat, locked the door of the van, opened the button of my uniform. I struggled but he managed to open it. He is bigger than I. He forced me to lie down on the seat. He pulled my panty and pulled up my brassier. Panty was pulled down my legs. He sucked my breasts. I tried to push him. He was heavy and big. I was weak. I felt the pain and became unconscious. I was sick. This was the first time I had sex. I became conscious after 5 minutes. Accused forced me to wake up. I was not fully conscious. My private part was wet. I was shivering. I was lying back. Accused was on the driver’s seat. The accused had put my uniform on and asked me to button it.”

The complainant asked the Appellant to take her home. He dropped her about 500 metres from her house. She went home and called for her mother. She collapsed inside the house. When she regained consciousness, her mother questioned her. She told her mother what had happened. Her mother called her father. He came and they went in a carrier to Nadi Police Station. She then went to hospital where she was examined by a doctor.

Under cross-examination she said she had refreshed her memory before coming to court, that she had eaten food in the van with the Appellant, that she had sat in the Appellant’s van willingly in order that he drop her home, that she did not run away from the Appellant although she could have. She said that she could not have escaped whilst being raped because the Appellant had locked the van. She said she did not have a bath before the medical examination. She was in all, cross-examined over 3 days of trial.

Under re-examination the complainant said that although she could have run away before the rape, she did not because she trusted the Appellant. She did not expect him to rape her. She said she did not consent to sexual intercourse.

PW3 was the complainant’s mother, Raijieli Dere. She gave evidence that on 30th October 1997, she was asleep when her daughter knocked on the door at about 11pm. When the witness opened the door the complainant fell inside and had to be carried to the settee. She was unconscious. When she became conscious she said “Ali Bilisi”, the name of the Appellant’s wife. She said that the Appellant had raped her and had held her forcibly in a van. She was distressed. The witness called the complainant’s father and he and the complainant went to Nadi Police Station. She said that she would not allow her daughter to take a shower. She said that the complainant was wearing school uniform with the belt loose and some buttons unbuttoned.

The next witness was Simione Dere, the complainant’s father. He gave evidence of the complainant’s distressed condition. He also said that after the incident the Appellant’s wife and two other villagers, were sent by Tui Nawaka with kerosene and yaqona to ask him to withdraw the complaint of rape. He refused. Two months later, another man, named Lisala was sent with cash and two cows to ask the witness to withdraw the complaint. He refused.

The next witness was Sgt. 748 Seru Savu who arrested and charged the Appellant. The Appellant made no statement to the police.

Cpl. 1224 Jese gave evidence that he was the investigating officer. He gave evidence of the crime scene, tendered the complainant’s clothes and the caution interview of the Appellant. He said he had checked the Appellant’s statement about one “Aseri” but that no person by the name of Aseri was working for “Endless Town.”

The caution interview was conducted in English. In that interview the Appellant said that on the 30th of October 1997 he had been patrolling in a Nissan pick-up in Nadi Town in the course of his work at Paradise Mobile Security. One Aseri was with him. Aseri was working for “Adventure Endless.” The Appellant said he met the complainant in town. She wanted a lift and said she wanted to eat something. He then drove to the tram-line and they ate together. The Appellant said that he introduced her to Aseri. He then dropped Aseri at Votualevu and he went home to get some money. He said that the complainant got off the vehicle 10 chains away from his house because she was afraid of his wife. He said he wanted $5.00 to buy “smokes.” He then said that he went straight to the complainant’s home and dropped her there. He denied stopping at the tram lines first. He denied raping the complainant, or having sexual intercourse with her. He denied smoking marijuana on that day or any day. He said that when he first met the complainant she already looked drowsy.

On 7th September 2001, the Appellant gave sworn evidence. His evidence was materially the same as his interview to police. However he said that after he had parked the van near his home to get money, he saw some boys from Vatutu Village walking on the road. He dropped her near Taniela’s house near the road at Vatutu after 11pm. He said that the attempts at reconciliation were made because it was Fijian custom. The purpose was to show that the offence had not been committed. He denied raping or abducting the complainant.

Under cross-examination he said that his wife and the complainant were on good terms and that his wife would not have got angry if he had taken the complainant home. He agreed that he dropped the complainant 2-3 chains from her house after 11pm, and that he could have personally handed her over to her parents. In re-examination he said that he did not know if the passenger’s door was locked or not and said that when he dropped the complainant home, the main entrance was locked.

The Appellant called no further witnesses. Judgment was delivered on 20th December 2001. In summary the learned Magistrate, after reviewing the evidence and the submissions, found that there was overwhelming evidence that at 11pm, on 30th October 1997, the complainant was in a state of distress. He said that distress however was only corroborative when it was genuine and not simulated and when it implicated the accused in the offence charged. However he said he needed first to consider the credibility of the complainant. He then said:

“The complainant told her mother what the accused did to her as soon as she reached home and became unconscious. Her father was also informed. Complainant was taken to the Police immediately. The accused dropped her near her house around 11.30pm. The medical examination was at 1.55am. The manner of her testimony, her demeanour and reporting the incident immediately leave no doubt about her credibility. The medical examination and the injuries on her genitals again reinforce her credibility.”

He then considered the Appellant’s sworn evidence. He found that because St. Andrew’s School is almost opposite the road to Vatutu village, the Appellant could have dropped her home within minutes when he stopped there to eat. The fact that he did not, showed he did not intend to take her home then. He said that the Appellant admitted being alone with the complainant until he dropped her in the village after 11pm. The doctor found at 1.55am that she had been raped. He found that the combination of the report and the Appellant’s admission to be corroborative of the complainant’s evidence. He also found the attempts at reconciliation by the wife and employer of the Appellant to be a corroborative piece of evidence on the count of rape.

As for the count of abduction, he found that the complainant was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence, that the complainant had accepted a lift from the Appellant so he would take her home, that the Appellant intended to rape her when he took her in his van and that the complainant’s consent to the lift was immaterial. He said he found on the evidence, “some conduct amounting to a substantial interference with the possessory relationship of parent and child” (R –v- Jones (1973) Crim. L.R. 621.) He convicted the Appellant on both counts.

The learned Magistrate then proceeded to sentence. The Appellant was, at this stage, unrepresented. During the trial he had been represented by counsel. In mitigation he said he was 34 years old, married, and the sole breadwinner in the family. He has 3 children. He was a first offender. The learned Magistrate said:

“This is a case of a brutal rape of a 16 year school girl in uniform. She was induced to inhale Indian hemp and raped when physically and mentally helpless. Her testimony was clear and precise in spite of suspicious investigation and prosecution. The sentences are made consecutive because the accused deserves a longer prison sentence.

Count 1 – 2 years imprisonment;
Count 2 – 5 years imprisonment

to be served consecutively.”

The appeal

The grounds of appeal, filed in person, may be summarised thus:

1. There was no direct evidence to prove the charges;

2. The learned Magistrate erred in accepting evidence of reconciliation as corroboration;

3. That the learned Magistrate erred in putting any weight on the medical report;

4. That the Appellant was not medically examined to show that he was the person who had raped the victim;

5. That the sentence was harsh and excessive.

The first ground of appeal is that there was no evidence to prove the charges. Of course, there was compelling evidence from the complainant, from her parents, from the doctor and from the Appellant himself, to support the charges. It was not in dispute that between 9pm and 11pm the complainant was with the Appellant in his van. Nor was it in dispute that for much of that time, they were alone together. Nor was it in dispute that the complainant was dropped near her home at 11pm or shortly thereafter in a near-fainting condition. The doctor's evidence was that she had been raped. The evidence against the Appellant was compelling because she had been with him just before she was dropped home. This evidence together with the recent complainants and the medical evidence established a strong prosecution case. There was ample evidence to support the complainant’s evidence as to the rape.

In respect of the charge of abduction, section 153 of the Penal Code provides as follows:

“Any person who, with intent that any unmarried girl under the age of eighteen years shall be unlawfully and carnally known by any man, whether such carnal knowledge is intended to be with any particular man or generally, takes or causes to be taken such girl out of the possession and against the will of her father or mother, guardian or any other person having the lawful care or charge of her, is guilty of a misdemeanour:

Provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under this section if it shall be made to appear to the court that the person so charged had reasonable cause to believe and did in fact believe that the girl was of or above the age of eighteen years.”

This offence is similar to the offence of “Abduction of unmarried girl under eighteen” under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 in England. The offence is committed when a girl under the age of eighteen, is taken out of the possession of her parents against their will for the purpose of sexual intercourse. In R –v- Manktelow (1853) 6 Cox 143, it was held that the “taking” need not be by force, either actual or constructive and it is immaterial whether the girl consents or not. There must be some evidence (as the learned Magistrate held) that there was a “substantial interference with the possessory relationship of parent and child” (Jones supra). In R –v- Timmins (1860) 8 Cox 401, the accused planned with the victim to meet and stay away from her home for several days. They did so meet and had sexual intercourse. The father did not consent, and the accused knew he did not consent. It was held that accused was rightly convicted of Abduction. It is a defence for the accused to show that he did not know, and had no reason to know that the girl was under the lawful care of her parents, or that he had reasonable cause to believe that she was over the age of eighteen. And, it was held in R –v- Mycock 12 Cox 28 that where the girl has already left her father’s house for a temporary purpose, intending to return to it, she is still in her father’s care within the meaning of the offence, and if whilst out of the house the accused induces her to go away with him, he is guilty. The question of whether the girl was in the possession of her parents is a question of fact.

Much of the cross-examination of the victim, in respect of the offence of Abduction, was aimed at her consent. In fact, as the authorities show, her consent, and any opportunities she may have had to leave the van, were irrelevant. The question was, as the learned Magistrate rightly asked, whether the parents (in particular her mother) consented and whether the Appellant had interfered with their possessory rights. It was abundantly clear from the facts that whilst the complainant’s parents knew the Appellant, and might have agreed to the complainant accepting a lift in his car, they did not consent to the two hour ride, the smoking of marijuana or the sexual intercourse with their daughter. This is so despite the absence of direct oral evidence from the complainant’s mother in this regard. This ground is dismissed.

The next ground is that the evidence of the complainant was uncorroborated. It is a sad indictment on the justice system in Fiji, that our law continues to preserve the need for a corroboration warning in sexual cases. Frequent calls have been made for the abolition of this law, not only from the victims of crime, but also from the judiciary. In Maika Soqonaivi –v- The State Crim. App. No. AAU008 of 1997, the Court of Appeal said:

“Before parting with this case, we refer to the law in Fiji requiring a judge to direct assessors that, in a sexual case, it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. This requirement is based on the requirement of the common law. It has been regarded as unsatisfactory in many jurisdictions. This is because of its inflexibility, the apparent assumption that complainants’ evidence is inherently unreliable, and the direction may result in a guilty person being acquitted solely because of the effect of the direction .... In New Zealand the law has been amended to remove the requirement, and leave the nature of any direction to the discretion of the trial judge .... We suggest that consideration be given to a similar amendment to the law in Fiji.”

And in Mark Mutch –v- The State Crim. App. No. AAU0060.1999, the Court said:

“The common-law requirement for corroboration of the complainant’s evidence in sexual cases is a frequent source of confusion and was criticised by this Court in Maika Soqonaivi –v- The State (13 Nov. 1998). It has been abolished by statute in New Zealand. However it is still the law in Fiji Islands ...”

I would add that the law on corroboration has now been amended in all states of Australia, in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Clearly urgent reform is required to prevent injustice in this area of the criminal law, and to respond to criticisms that the law of corroboration in sexual cases, which has the greatest impact on women and children, is an example of an inequality before the law.

The law as it stands requires a judge to direct assessors (and a magistrate to direct himself or herself) that it is dangerous to convict without corroboration. Then the court must identify those pieces of evidence (if any) which are capable in law of constituting sources of corroboration.

The learned Magistrate did not direct himself that it was dangerous to convict in the absence of corroboration. However, the danger was obviously a matter he had considered, because he went on to discuss pieces of evidence he found to be corroborative. The failure to give a corroboration warning is usually fatal especially where there is no possible corroboration on the facts, or where the court might decide that whilst there was evidence capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant, it did not in fact do so. However, in cases where a warning was not given but there was evidence which indisputably amounted to corroboration, it may be found that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. Further, as Williams J said in Mohammed Kasim –v- Reg 22 FLR 120, a magistrate hearing a rape/sexual assault case, does not need to warn himself/herself about the dangers of convicting in the absence of corroboration where he/she has found such corroboration. This is because he/she is judge of fact and law. At page 130, his Lordship said:

“In R –v- Trigg (1963) 47 Cr. App. R. 94, it was held that where there is evidence, which if accepted must amount to corroboration, the jury should still be informed of the danger of convicting on uncorroborated evidence. However a professional magistrate combining the functions of judge and jury is in a different position. A jury returning a verdict of guilty may have rejected corroborative evidence and accepted the evidence of the complainant alone, but juries do not give reasons for their verdicts and warnings are necessary features of a summing up. On the other hand a magistrate or judge sitting alone gives his reasons for his verdict and they may well reveal that he has borne the dangers in mind ......

I conclude that in a trial conducted by a professional magistrate sitting alone, where there is corroboration in a sexual case he is not obliged to specifically direct himself as to the need for it provided it is apparent that he must have accepted it.”

In this case the learned Magistrate identified four sources of corroboration, the medical evidence, the evidence of distress, the Appellant’s own admissions that he was with the complainant from 9pm to 11pm when he dropped her home, and the attempts at reconciliation.

Of course, evidence of distress must always be approached with care. As Williams J said in Mohammed Kasim –v- Reg (supra) evidence of distress can be corroborative but it must, in all the circumstances, implicate the accused and must clearly be unsimulated. Thus in Redpath -v- R 46 Cr. App. R. 319, a little girl was indecently assaulted by a motorist who then drove away. However a stranger had seen the accused go towards the child, and immediately afterwards had seen the child emerge looking distressed. The child was not aware that she was being observed and the distress was closely linked to the accused’s appearance near her. The evidence of distress was accepted as corroboration.

In Mohammed Kasim (supra) the victim had been absent from the tourist party she was part of for 45 minutes. On her return she was pale, weeping and trembling. She said she had been raped by the appellant. Williams J held that in the circumstances, the evidence of distress was unlikely to be simulated and that in the circumstances of that case, it was rightly treated as corroboration. Similarly, in this case, the complainant collapsed when she reached home shortly after leaving the Appellant. He conceded that he had dropped her near her home, and despite references to “boys” walking around the area, there was no other person who could have been the source of her distress. Further her parents said she had fainted, and this was not disputed by the defence. Clearly the learned Magistrate accepted that the distress was not simulated, and only then did he treat this piece of evidence as corroboration. I do not consider that he erred.

The medical evidence did not implicate the accused directly. However the Appellant does accept that he was with the complainant until he dropped her home, although, he says he never had sexual intercourse with her at all. His admission, his denial about sexual intercourse, and the complainant’s medical condition found on the same night, together were capable of corroborating the complainant’s evidence. I find that the learned Magistrate did not err in this regard.

The Appellant in his submissions in court said that he was not examined and that there ought to have been a nurse present during the examination. These matters were not put to Dr. Prem Chand during examination. Of course, an efficient investigator would have ensured that the accused is medically examined, and would have asked the doctor to report on whether the white substance found on the complainant’s vagina was sperm from the accused. However, despite shortcomings in the investigation (about which the learned Magistrate also complained) there was ample evidence to prove the Appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The last source of corroboration found by the learned Magistrate was the evidence of attempted reconciliation. He said at page 51 of the record:

“P4 the complainant’s father said the accused’s wife came to see him with yaqona to reconcile. Later the accused’s employer sent a cow, a calf and promised $1000 to withdraw the complaint. The defence submission is that the accused was not personally involved. But the interference related to the rape complaints. The interference was by the wife of the accused and the employer of the accused – also a corroborative circumstance.”

Evidence must, to be capable of being corroborative, be independent of the complaint, and must implicate the accused in a material way in respect of the offence charge. Whilst the evidence of reconciliation was certainly independent of the complainant, there was no evidence led as to any admissions made by the accused (or with his consent) during the exchange between the Appellant’s wife and employer, and the complainant’s father. If there had been admissions made during a conversation between the parties, and if those admissions had come from the Appellant either directly or indirectly, then the attempted reconciliation might have provided corroboration.

However, reconciliation is often an attempt to keep the peace between two sets of disputing parties. Often, admissions may be made about which the accused may not be consulted. In this case, it is not known what admissions were made, and to what extent the Appellant himself was implicated by any such attempt at reconciliation. As such, I consider that the learned Magistrate did err in accepting the attempted reconciliation as corroboration.

However, such error made no difference to the result. There was ample corroboration elsewhere in the case. Although the learned Magistrate made an error, there was no miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal fails. The appeal against conviction is unsuccessful.

Sentence

The final ground of appeal is in respect of sentence. The starting point for rape in Fiji is 7 years imprisonment. For the rape of children, it is 10 years imprisonment. Although the complainant was not a child under the age of 16, she was just 16 and still at school. The learned Magistrate was restricted by his sentencing powers and imposed 5 years imprisonment. The High Court would have imposed a heavier sentence, perhaps in the region of 7 - 8 years imprisonment.

As for the count of abduction, the circumstances of the abduction were not attractive. The inducements, the persuasion as to the use of marijuana and the fact that the Appellant was trusted as an older relative by the complainant, all called for a deterrent sentence. The learned Magistrate imposed the maximum possible under section 153 of the Penal Code.

Counsel for the State provided me with a number of English authorities for child abduction and kidnapping. The sentences ranged from 18 months imprisonment to 6 years imprisonment. However, the maximum sentence for kidnapping in England and Wales is 7 years imprisonment and therefore comparisons with our laws in Fiji is not helpful.

I would consider this case to be one of the worst of its kind. The betrayal of trust and the use of marijuana would justify a starting point of 18 months imprisonment. After reduction for good character, and enhancement for the age of the complainant, and the reasons for the abduction, I would arrive at a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. I do not consider that the learned Magistrate erred in passing a 2 year term on Count 1.

As for the consecutive sentences, separate offences normally lead to consecutive sentences. However where the total sentence is excessive and does not properly reflect the offending, concurrent sentences may be ordered.

In this case although the rape and abduction are factually closely linked they are separate offences. Further, a total of 7 years imprisonment is a sentence which reflects the totality of the offending in this case.

For these reasons, the appeal against sentence also fails. This appeal is wholly dismissed.

5,652,243699,"SENTENCE
 
  
• In a judgment delivered in the Suva Magistrate Court on 10 March 2017, the Learned Resident Magistrate found you guilty and convicted you on the following charge:
 

Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal code Act 17.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
AKUILA NAVUDA on the 22nd day of December 2006 at Samabula Central Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of L. S, without her consent.
 
  
• I have read the Magistrate Court record. The case started on 20 February 2007 and concluded on 10 March 2017, almost 10 years later. All parties are to be blamed for this sorry state of affairs, that is, the Prosecution, the defence and the court. The court should have taken a more robust case management method; the prosecution should have taken a more determined attitude to bring the case to a conclusion and the accused should not have absconded from the court for more than 3 years. This sorry state of affairs should be avoided in future by transferring all rape cases to the High Court for trial as soon as possible after first call.
 
 
• In any event, I have read the Learned Resident Magistrate judgment dated 10 March 2017, and as judge of fact and law, he had found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. In my view, his reasoning was sound.
 
 
• The facts of the case were as follows. In 2006, there was a training centre at Wailoku for young girls who wanted to become nuns. The complainant (PW1) was part of this group. She was assigned the task to prepare the breakfast for the girls on 22 December 2006. At 5am, she woke up and went outside to prepare the fire for their tea. While doing the same, a person approached her from behind, closed her mouth with one hand and put a knife to her neck. The person then dragged her to a nearby plantation, forcefully took off her clothes, indecently assaulted her and penetrated her vagina with his penis without her consent. During the attack, the person held a knife to the complainant’s stomach. The complainant identified the accused as her alleged rapist. The matter was reported to the police. An investigation was carried out. The accused was finally tried and convicted in the Suva Magistrate Court.
 
 
• As I have said in State v Poate Rainima, Criminal Case No. HAC 034 of 2011S, High Court, Suva, “Rape” is always a serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. It is the worst form of sexual assault on an individual. It is an unwanted invasion of a person’s body without that person’s consent. Consequently, the courts take a dim view of it, and have set a tariff of 7 to 15 years imprisonment. The worse form of rape is reserved for the higher end of the tariff See Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal. The final sentence will depend on the presence or otherwise of mitigating and/or aggravating factors.
 
 
• The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows: 
• (i) Use of a knife in the offence: The level of violence you used on the complainant while offending against her was very high. First, you attacked her from behind when she was lighting the fire for their tea. Then you gagged her mouth with a hand and put a knife to her neck, and threatened to kill her if she raised the alarm. Then you dragged her to a nearby plantation, performed indecencies on her and forcefully raped her. Throughout the rape, you held a knife to her stomach, and warned her not to raise the alarm. Then after raping her, you warned her that you will return. You were really mean to the complainant when you offended against her, and you must not complain when you loose your liberty to pay for your crime.
 
• (ii) You had no regard whatsoever to her right as a human being when you attacked and raped her.
 
• (iii) Obviously, you planned your attack on her early in the morning, when the others were still asleep.
 

 
• The mitigating factor was as follows: 
• (i) Looking at the court record, you had been remanded in custody for a total of 1 year 8 months approximately.
 

 
• I start with a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 19 years imprisonment. I deduct 2 years for time already served while remanded in custody, leaving a balance of 17 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Mr. Akuila Navuda, for violently raping the complainant at Wailoku in the Central Division on 22 December 2006, I sentence you to 17 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 16 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.
 
 
• Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009, the above sentence is designed to punish you in a manner which is just in all the circumstances, to protect the community from people like you, to deter other would-be offenders and to signify that the court and the community denounce what you did to the complainant on 22 December 2006 when you raped her using a knife
 
 
• The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.
 
 
• You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

",1,0,1,1,2,sentence,569
7,654,76004,"JUDGMENT

[1] On the 29th July 2011, the appellant entered an unequivocal plea of guilty to one charge of assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four months and now appeals that sentence on the grounds that it was harsh and excessive and secondly that similar cases have received more lenient sentences. 

[2] The facts admitted by the appellant in the court below were that on the 12th June 2011 at 7.30pm the appellant was drinking grog at home when an argument developed between him and his wife over her proposed visit to her family. The appellant pushed and punched his wife causing her to fall and hit her head on the stud of the house. The victim wife reported the matter to the Police the next morning and she was medically examined. The accused was arrested and admitted hitting the victim.

[3] The maximum penalty for this offence is five years imprisonment and the tariff ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation to nine months imprisonment for more serious assaults. (Devi HAC 4 of 1998, Seraka HAA27.2008). It was said in Korovata (2006) HAA115/06S that in domestic violence cases terms of 18 months could be justified.

[4] The learned Magistrate took a starting point of seven months imprisonment and enhanced that by two months for the aggravating feature of the assault being on his own wife. She then deducted three months for his mitigating features said to include remorse, reconciliation and co-operation with the Police and added a further discount of two months for the early guilty plea bringing the final total sentence to four months imprisonment.

[5] Mr Kohli for the appellant prays that the sentence is inconsistent with other sentences handed down for this offence in similar circumstances. He has not produced any cases to show this, but in any event it is a spurious submission. Every case turns on its own facts and it is a futile exercise to try to attach identical sentences to every conviction for the same offence. For every case that he might say attracted a suspended sentence there could be produced cases which have attracted lengthy terms of imprisonment.

[6] In the recent case of Raisoqoni HAA 004.2011S, Goundar J. upheld a six month term imposed by a Magistrate for the same offence, again in a domestic violence context. 

[7] In the instant case there was no evidence of provocation whatsoever. The wife was merely asking to visit her family, a request which for some reason appears to have irritated the appellant. His assault was swift, unnecessary and dangerous.

[8] Assaults in a domestic context are particularly odious in that wives, and husbands for that matter, should be able to feel safe in their homes without having their trust in their loved ones betrayed. The learned Magistrate was quite correct in finding that the domestic element to this offending was an aggravating feature.

[9] The sentence is well within the accepted tariff for the offence. The Magistrate has not made any error of law in passing the sentence, and in the circumstances it is an entirely appropriate sentence.

[10] The appeal against sentence has no merit and is dismissed.

",1,1,0,0,1,judgment,556
8,655,253957,"JUDGMENT
 
 
[1] On the 28th July 2014 in the Magistrates' Court at Suva the Respondent, a serving police officer, entered a plea of guilty to one count of assault causing actual bodily harm. He admitted a summary of facts
 
 
[2] On the 20th March 2015 he was sentenced as follows:
 
  
• No conviction recorded;
 
• Adjourned for 2 years;
 
• Bound over in the sum of $2000 for 2 years to be on good behavior;
 
• Commit no other offence in 2 years; and
 
• If no offending and good behavior in 2 years you will be discharged pursuant to s.44 of Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 

[3] The State appeals that sentence on two grounds:
 
  
• That the Magistrate erred in law in not imposing a conviction on the grounds that the accused was a police officer when there was no evidence that a conviction would affect his occupation.
 
 
• That the learned Magistrate imposed a sentence that was below tariff for this type of offending and was manifestly lenient.
 

Facts
 
 
[4] The facts of the case were that on the 9th March 2014 in the late afternoon the wife of the respondent confronted him asking why he had left their child unattended earlier that day. A heated argument arose, and the respondent assaulted his wife by throwing punches on to her face and the back of her head. A medical examination revealed ""bruising and abrasion on the left side of the forehead"". The respondent admitted the assault when interviewed under caution. He entered his plea of guilty at the first opportunity.
 
 
The Sentence
 
 
[5] The Magistrate in her discretion, rather than imposing an immediate penalty, made use of section 44 of Sentencing and Penalties Decree. She has followed the provisions of the section almost completely.
 
 
Analysis
 
 
[6] In her attempt to treat this accused leniently, the Magistrate unfortunately fell into errors. The provisions of s.44 of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree (""SPD"") only come into play after conviction (s.44(2)). Had she wanted to record no conviction then she could have used s.16 or s.43(d) but then the question arises; would this be an appropriate case to do so?
 
 
[7] A ""normal"" punishment for a domestic violence assault is a term of imprisonment for a period of between 9 and 12 months with an enhancement up to 18 months if the assault be considered serious. A judicial officer can of course sentence outside that tariff if and only if he or she gives reasons for departing from the tariff.
 
 
[8] In a domestic violence context, a sentencing tribunal must take into account the factors set out in section 4(3) of the SPD. Unfortunately, despite the word mustcontained in the section, so many judicial officers don't. In this case, although she does not specifically say so, the Magistrate has considered the factors she should. Section 4(3)(d) is particularly relevant which states:
 
 
 S.4(3) A Court must have regard to -
 
 (d) the effect of the offence in terms of hardship, dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim.
 
 
 In attempting to order no conviction and adjourn the matter with conditions, the Magistrate said;
 
 
 ""after considering s.16 of SPD, this Court takes into account that the offence is a minor one and that you have no previous convictions and that a conviction against you will affect your employment, therefore no conviction is entered against you.""
 
 
[9] Whether punching your wife's head, leaving 'bruises and abrasions', is a minor offence or not is debateable. The respondent's counsel refers me to the case of Kumar [2001] FJLR 225 where Gates J (as he then was) was determining the fate of a police officer who had assaulted his wife. Gates J ruled that the accused be discharged without conviction, saying:
 
 
 ""upon the basis that a punishment, if it were to result in the loss of the respondent's livelihood with the Police, would be disproportionate to the crime committed ..........""
 
 
 This case runs counter however to the same Judge's decision in Batiratu HAR 001/2012 where the Chief Justice distinguished the Kumar case and said ""absolute discharges are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances such as where no moral blame detaches, where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty.""
 
 
[10] There can be no doubt that this case is not a technical breach nor one where no moral blame attaches. In these days where domestic violence is very much in the forefront of the public consciousness, police officers who are tasked to uphold the law must be also seen to stay within the law.
 
 
[11] An appellate Court would upset the exercise of judicial discretion in a Court below very rarely, however in balancing here the competing interests of the State and the accused it has to be determined that the strict provisions of the Domestic Violence Decree must flow on to a policeman charged with assaulting his police-woman wife. There is no evidence before the Court either below or here that would say that his future in the Force would be affected but in any event that is a factor that he should have considered before launching a physical attack on his wife who had extended to him very little if any provocation.
 
 
[12] Since Batiratu (supra), it is now a well-entrenched truth in our criminal law that nobody is above the law. The Chief Justice there and this Court here give a loud voice of application of human dignity, equality and freedom as enshrined in section 3(1) of the Constitution 2013.
 
 
[13] There is no reason why there should be no conviction recorded in the present case. The Magistrate's order to the contrary is quashed and it is ordered that a conviction be recorded.
 
 
[14] Punches around the head are potentially dangerous and in this case an enormous overreaction to a dispute over babysitting. The accused having been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm must be punished for that crime.
 
 
[15] Given that the hypothetical plumber from Raiwaqa would receive a sentence of at least 9 months (depending on his mitigation), I would attach a high degree of leniency to this accused's sentence, taking him out of the tariff for the offence.
 
 
[16] On any review where a lenient sentence is to be replaced by a harsher penalty, that harsher sentence should be alleviated to compensate for the accused's reasonable expectation that his case had been dealt with and determined presumably to his satisfaction.
 
 
[17] In addition, the accused had strong mitigation features available to him in that he had entered a plea of guilty to the offence, he was a first offender, he had reconciled with his wife and he was relatively young.
 
 
[18] Pursuant to section 256(2) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009, I quash the adjournment orders made in the Court below and would substitute a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.
 
 
[19] I confirm the Magistrate's Domestic Violence Restraining Order imposed on the accused as perpetrator and the wife and child as protected persons, which will remain in force until further orders.
 
 
[20] This is a sentence passed in special circumstances and is not to be regarded as a precedent sentence for police officers assaulting their wives.

",1,1,0,0,1,judgment,1275
9,656,81457,"SENTENCE

	1.	Complainant victim of this case has been your de-facto wife. She was 30 and engaged in domestic duties. On 07.04.2012 she asked you to carry your 7 month old baby to ease him from crying. However you got annoyed from her call and later threw a punch at her.

	2.	She reported this matter to the police and shortly she was medically examined. The medical report states that she sustained mild swelling on her left forehead due to the assault. 

	3.	You were then arrested and interviewed under caution. The allegation was admitted during the caution interview. 

	4.	This incident led the police investigators to charge you on the following count.
	I.	Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm – Contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. 

	5.	You initially appeared without any legal representation and indicated willingness to seek Legal Aid assistance. The Court granted a date to facilitate your request. On 12.11.2012 you decided to enter a 'plea of guilt' before this Court. The Court is satisfied on the voluntariness of your plea. 

	6.	Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree will not have any application to this case for reconciliation due to the domestic setting of the facts. Thus Court further proceeded to issue an interim domestic violence restraining order against you for the well being of the victim until the conclusion of this case. 

	7.	Foregoing Summary of Facts was read over, explained and having understood the same, you admitted it. This Court convicts you for the offence.

	8.	The Penal Code offence of 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm' under Sections 245 attracted a maximum sentence of 05 years imprisonment. The present offence even though brought under Section 275 of the Crimes Decree 2009 is similar.

	9.	The Tariff for 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm' under Section 245 of the Penal Code (now repealed), varies from a suspended sentence to 09 months imprisonment. (per Goundar J in Jonethani Sereka v State [2008]HAA 027/08S, 25 APR 2008) 

	10.	In view of the foregoing facts and the sentencing guidelines stipulated in section 4 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I select 07 months imprisonment as the starting point for your sentence.

AGGRAVATING FACTORS

	1.	The victim is the de-facto wife of you and she was 30 years old. The vulnerability of the victim due to the domestic relationship is indeed an aggravating factor in the offence. 

	2.	In the circumstance, I increase the sentence by another 03 months.

	3.	Period of imprisonment now stands at 10 months.

MITIGATING FACTORS

	1.	Your early guilty plea takes 3 months of your sentence off.

	2.	In your mitigation submission, you stated that you are a 33 year old, separated from the relationship, unemployed person. You have sought forgiveness from the complainant victim. 

	3.	However the Court notes that you are not a first offender. Therefore I rule that you are not entitled for the concession which is given to the persons of good character.

	4.	The Court was informed by your mitigation submission that the victim had left you from the relationship.

	5.	The effect of your violence can be envisaged from her decision to leave you and your relationship. The legal system does not wish to intervene in to the relationships of the persons. There can be disagreements and differences between parties. And also there should be some room for the parties to resolve their own problems. But it must be free from any physical or physiological violence. 

	6.	It is the paramount duty of domestic legal framework to ensure a violence free household.

	7.	Your final term of imprisonment now stands at 7 months.

	8.	In terms of Section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 a sentence below two years could be suspended by this Court.

	9.	Section 4(1) (c) and (e) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 state that the Court should deter offender and the other persons of the community from committing the same or similar offences. And also it is important to denounce such crimes.

	10.	You have not been charged for a similar offence prior to the incident. These circumstances warrant a non custodial sentence. On the other hand the Court has to consider an intervention to the increasing number of domestic violence cases. A domestic relationship of parties does not give any kind of authorization to either party to use violence on the other party to solve their problems. The offenders of such should bear in mind that the Court will act on them strictly even they are first offenders. 

	11.	However you stated in your mitigation that you are currently in custody and looking after your one year old son. If the Court issues a custodial sentence the direct impact will be on the child and it will deteriorate his well being. Therefore the Court decided to suspend your sentence.

	12.	Jokatama Ledua today you are sentenced to 7 months imprisonment and it is suspended for 12 months.

	13.	Any subsequent conviction during the period of suspension will be a ground for the reactivation of the term imposed and suspended by this Court.

	14.	Further the interim domestic violence restraining order which was issued by this Court for non molestation will have permanent effect on you. The order is made in accordance with section 24(1) (b) (1) of the Domestic Violence Decree 2009 to ensure wellbeing of the victim. 

	15.	Twenty eight (28) days to appeal.

10,657,253671,"SENTENCE
 
  
• JOELI NOKA TAWAKE, you were charged in this Court for 03 counts of Defilement of Young Person between 13 and 16 years contrary to section 215 of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.
 
 
• You pleaded guilty for the charge and also admitted the summary of facts presented by the State. 
 
 
• Summary of facts states the following: 
 

The accused Joeli Noka Tawake a 24 years old farmer at Yacata Island of Cakaudrove and the victim is Seleima Sese a 15 years old student of Yacata Island Cakaudrove. The victim's date of birth was 30th May 1996. Both the accused and the victim were living at Yacata Island and on the 31st day of December 2010 at about 12 midnight the victim was celebrating new years with her friends when the accused took her to a vacant house belonging to one Tomasi undressed her and undressed himself and then penetrated the victim's vagina with his penis. The accused than told the victim not to tell her father and the victim said she will not tell her father.
 
 
Secondly, on the 1st day of January 2011 at about 9.00pm the victim was again beating drums in the village celebrating new year's with her friends when the accused took her again to the vacant house of Tomasi undressed her and removed his pants and underwear and penetrated her vagina with his penis whilst the victim was lying on the floor. After the sexual intercourse the victim got dressed and went to her home.
 
 
Thirdly, on the 2nd day of January 2011 at about 1.00am the accused again took the victim to the vacant house belonging to Tomasi and fondle with her breasts undressed her and then also undressed himself and then penetrated her vagina with his penis with her consent. The victim left home after the sexual intercourse.
 
 
Matter was reported to police and the accused was interviewed under caution and was charged for 3 counts of Rape and later amended to 3 counts of Defilement of a girl between 13 and 16 years of age.
 
 
Accused has no previous conviction.
 
  
• I am satisfied that your plea is unequivocal and convicts you for this charge. 
 

The Law and the Tariff 
 
  
• The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 
 
 
• In State v Raibevu [2012] FJHC 1040 his Lordship Justice Madigan stated:
 

""The maximum penalty for defilement is ten years' imprisonment; and the usual range of sentences is from a suspended sentence for protagonists in a ""virtuous relationship"" whilst the higher end of the range is for offenders who are older and in a position of trust. (Rokowaqa CA 37/2004, Kabaura HAC 117/2010). In the case of Donumainasuva CA 32/2001, Shameem, J said ""The offence is clearly designed to protect young girls who have entered puberty and experiencing social and hormonal changes, from sexual exploitation.
 
 
Aggravating Factors 
 
  
• I find no aggravating factors in this case apart from the facts that falls in to the elements of the offence. 
 

Mitigating factors 
 
  
• You are young offender as well as first offender. You seeks forgiveness from this court and remorseful. Also you are married with a child. You also pleaded guilty without going for a trial saving the victim from giving evidence.
 
 
• After considering the facts in this case I select 18 months as my starting point for each count and deduct 06 months for all the mitigating factors to reach 12 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• Considering the totality principle these are concurrent to each other. You have made a traditional apology which was accepted by the family of the victim. Also the State admitted that at the time of the offending there was a relationship between you and the victim. There is only a slight age differences between the parties which is another advantage factor for you 
 
 
• Therefore I find this is a fit and a proper case to give a suspend sentence which would enable you the chance to reform. Accordingly you are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for this charge and this will be suspended for 03 years. 
 
 
• If you commit any offences during next 03 years you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal

11,658,76549,"SENTENCE

1. On 3rd June, 2011, in the presence of your counsel, you pleaded guilty to the following charges:

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Cap 17. 

Particulars of Offence

N. S. between the 1st of January 2004 and the 31st of December 2004 at ... Village, Wainibuka in the Eastern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of V. R., without her consent.
SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

RAPE: contrary to Section 207(1) and 207(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

N. S. on the 29th day of August 2010 at ... Village, Wainibuka in the Eastern Division had carnal knowledge of V. R., without her consent.
2. The prosecutor read her summary of facts in court. Briefly, they were as follows. In 2004, you were having difficulties in your marital life. Your wife often refused intimacy with you, despite your request. Your child was aged 10 to 11 years at the time. She was attending Class 6. As a result of your marital difficulty, you forced yourself sexually on her, when she was 10 years and approaching 11 years. You had sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. In any event, a child under 13 years is incapable of consenting to sex in law. You knew, at the time that, she was not consenting to sex with you, and was incapable of consenting to sex, as she was a child.

3. On 29th August 2010, at a village in Wainibuka, you again forced yourself on your daughter. She was 17 years old at the time. You invited her to see the new family pig pen. Away from prying eyes, you forced her to take off her clothes. This was in the bush. You then inserted your penis into her vagina, without her consent. You knew at the time that she was not consenting to sex. You later threatened her not to tell anyone about the matter. However, the matter was reported to the police. An investigation was carried out. You admitted the offences when caution interviewed by police. As a result, you were charged with raping your daughter.

4. After the summary of facts were read in court, the court checked with your counsel to see that all the elements of rape were admitted by you. On your behalf, your counsel admitted that, you had sexual intercourse with the complainant, at the material times in counts No. 1 and 2, without her consent, and you knew she was not consenting to sex, at the time. As a result, the court found you guilty as charged on both counts, and convicted you accordingly, on those counts.

5. I know that at the age of 45 years old, this is your first offence. You are married with only one daughter. You earn your living by subsistence farming. According to your lawyer, your wife often belittles you, and continually deprives you of marital intimacy. This was further aggravated by the unkind taunting from your in-laws. I have carefully read all the papers submitted by the parties.

6. Rape is a serious offence. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment. For adults, the tariff is a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment: see Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwaiv The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal.

7. Since the complainant in this case was a juvenile in 2004, when she was 10 to 11 years old, the tariff for the rape of children is a sentence between 10 to 15 years: see Mark Mutch v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0060 of 1999, Fiji Court of Appeal; State v Lepani Saitava, Criminal Case No. HAC 10 of 2007, High Court, Suva; The State v AV, Criminal Case No. HAC 192 of 2008, High Court, Suva; State v VV, Criminal Case No. HAC 084 of 2009, High Court, Suva and State v Waqabaca, Criminal Case No. HAC 139 of 2008, High Court, Suva. The actual sentence will depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors.

8. The mitigating factors in your case were as follows. First, you pleaded guilty in this case, and therefore saved the court's time. In addition, you avoided the need for the complainant to re-live her ordeal in the courtroom, by giving evidence. Second, at the age of 45 years old, this is your first offence. Third, you are a person of limited education, reaching only Class 6 level. Fourth, you were remanded in custody from 29th October 2010 to 4th February, 2011, and from 3rd to 15th June 2011 – a period of approximately, 5 months.

9. The aggravating factors in your case were as follows. First, your case involved the rape of a child in 2004. This makes the case even more serious. Children are vulnerable members of our society, and when they are attacked sexually, the courts will step in to protect them. In protecting children, the courts are duty bound to give a deterrent sentence. Second, the complainant was your only child and daughter. Your offending was a gross abuse of parental trust. This child looked to you for protection. You are her father. Yet, instead of being a pillar of strength to her, you became a monster to her. You threw away the special protective and caring relationship between a father and daughter. Third, your offending against this child continued throughout 2004. You accompanied this immoral behavior with continued threats against her not to tell anyone about the matter. You continued to mistreat her, and swore at her, whenever you need to have sex with her. These simply are not the actions of a father. Fourth, you again raped her when she was 17 years old. You showed utter disregard to her safety and her right to be treated as a human being.

10. On count No. 1, I start with a sentence of 11 years imprisonment. For the mitigating factors, I deduct 3 years from the 11 years, leaving a balance of 8 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I add 7 years to the 8 years, making a total of 15 years imprisonment.

11. On count No. 2, I repeat the above process and sentence.

12. In summary, I sentence you to 15 years imprisonment on count No. 1 and count No. 2. Both sentences are concurrent to each other, that is, a total sentence of 15 years imprisonment. Pursuant to section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I fix the non-parole period as 11 years imprisonment.

",1,0,1,1,2,sentence,1150
12,659,71398,"JUDGMENT

[1] The appellant was convicted on his pleas of guilty on one count each of rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was sentenced on 19 March 2007 to seven years imprisonment for rape and twelve months imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with each other, giving a total sentence of seven years.

[2] He submitted an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on 30 April 2007. On 1 June 2007, Ward P directed that the record should be prepared so that the application for leave could be considered.

[3] On 24 March 2009, the appellant appeared in person and informed the Court that he wanted to pursue appeal against sentence alone. The application for leave and the substantive appeal were heard together.

[4] The facts were that on 8 March 2006 at around 1am, the appellant and the complainant left a nightclub together. As they walked down the street, the appellant punched the complainant on her mouth. She fell down and sustained cuts and bruises. She rolled down a slope.

[5] The appellant followed her and after forcefully removing her clothes, raped her. When they returned to the nightclub, the complainant complained to a police officer.

[6] The principal ground of appeal is that the sentence is harsh and excessive. The appellant repeats the mitigating factors which were raised at the trial.

[7] In passing sentence the judge explained the matters of which she took account:

""The starting point on Count 1 for rape is 7 years imprisonment. I do not take into account the assault, because you are charged separately for that. However I consider the breach of trust because you and the complainant are already known to each other, and the dragging down the slope which must have added to the trauma of the rape. For these factors I increase your sentence to 9 years imprisonment.

For your good character, guilty plea, remorse and family circumstances, I reduce your sentence by two years, to 7 years imprisonment.

On Count 1, I sentence you to 7 years imprisonment.

On Count 2, you assaulted someone known to you and caused injuries to her lip and hip. After taking into account all aggravating and mitigating circumstances I sentence you on Count 2 to 12 months imprisonment. Because I have not considered the injuries to the complainant on Count 1, I would be expected to order the sentences to be served consecutively. However I consider the 7 year term imposed on Count 1 to properly reflect the totality of the offending. The sentences on Counts 1 and 2 are therefore to be served concurrently.""

[8] It is trite law that an appellate court will only interfere with a sentence if it is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.

[9] Over the years the courts have considered rape a serious offence. The gravity of this offence has led the Court of Appeal in the case of Kasim v. State Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993 (27 May 1994) to fix a starting point. The Court said:

""While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this Court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

[10] Albeit Kasim was considered fifteen years ago and the starting point may need revisiting in the current sentencing climate, we consider the starting point of seven years imprisonment for rape in this case was an appropriate term.

[11] However, we are concerned about two aspects of the sentence. The judge considered the complainant’s relationship with the appellant and the fact that she was dragged down a slope as aggravating factors to justify an increase of the sentence by two years. In a case where the offender is in a position of trust arising from special position he or she holds, such as that of an employer or of a public transport operator, or is related to the victim, or is an authority figure to the victim, any breach of that trust is justified to be used as an aggravating factor to increase the sentence.

[12] In the present case, while the complainant knew the appellant through previous relationship, there was no evidence that at the time the offence was committed, they were in an existing relationship to give rise to a breach of trust. Previous relationship between the appellant and the complainant was irrelevant and should not have been considered either a mitigating or an aggravating factor. We find the judge fell in error when she considered the breach of trust as an aggravating factor to enhance the sentence. 

[13] Our second concern is the amount of credit given to the compelling mitigating factors present in this case. The appellant showed genuine remorse by admitting the offence to the police and by pleading guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. He not only saved the court time and the resources but relieved the complainant from giving evidence of sexual nature which would have been a distasteful experience for her. The appellant was a person of previous good character and came from a disadvantaged background. We take the view that the discount of two years did not sufficiently account for these mitigating factors. 

[14] We bear in mind that different judges may give different weight to the mitigating factors and that this Court should be slow to intervene in a sentence on the ground of insufficient weight given by the sentencing court to the various mitigating factors, we nevertheless, are satisfied that this is a case where our intervention is justified. Rape cases pose an inherent difficulty in its prosecution because of the nature of evidence that the complainant has to recollect and testify. When an accused pleads guilty, substantial discount should be given for relieving the complainant from giving evidence of sexual nature.

[15] In Navuniani Koroi v. The State Criminal Appeal No: AAU0037 of 2002S this court said:

""It has long been the practice of the courts to reduce a sentence where the accused person has pleaded guilty. In most cases that is a recognition of his contrition as expressed by an early admission and the fact that it will save the witnesses and the court a great deal of time and expense. In offences of a sexual nature, the amount of reduction is generally more because the plea saves the victim from having to attend the trial and relive her experience in the witness box.""

[16] We would start with seven years imprisonment and add one year for the use of violence in committing the rape. For the early guilty plea, remorse, previous good character and family circumstances we would reduce the sentence by three years and arrive at a term of five years imprisonment.

[17] We would not interfere with the sentence imposed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and with the order making the sentences concurrent.

Result

[18] Leave to appeal out of time is granted. The appeal against sentence is allowed.

[19] Sentence of seven years imprisonment for rape is quashed and a sentence of five years substituted.

[1] The accused has been convicted by this Court after trial of two counts of rape of the same girl who in the first instance was 12 years old and in the second incident 13 years old. 
 
 
[2] The facts were that the victim called Linda (not her real name) was with her father visiting relatives in Nabouwalu, Bua in 2012. They stayed overnight with many other visitors in the home of the accused’s uncle. The accused was also staying the night. During the night the accused took Linda to another room where he undressed her and had sexual intercourse with her. As she was under 13 at the time the issue of consent is not relevant.
 
 
[3] In August 2014, the young girl was again in the village and walking home from church. She came across the accused on the road and he dragged her off the road to a deserted spot where he detained her and raped her. She related the incident to her father who was incensed that she was late home and the Police were informed. 
 
 
[4] The accused is now 23 years old but 19 in 2012 and 21 in 2014. He is single but cares for his elderly widowed mother and a 9 year old nephew. He left school, aged 9 when his father died and has since that time built a house for his family in Siberia, Labasa. 
 
 
[5] He is employed as a construction labourer earning $130 per week. 
 
 
[6] He is a first offender.
 
 
[7] It is now well accepted after the Supreme Court’s decision in AnandAbhay RajCAV0003.2014that the tariff for rape of a minor is a band from 10 to 16 years. 
 
 
[8] Apart from the mitigating features advanced on the accused’s behalf by his Counsel, it is also to his credit that no violence was occasioned to the victim in either of the incidents. 
 
 
[9] It is tragic that a young man should become embroiled in such affairs that will deprive him of his constructive and valuable years and will deprive a family of a son who has appeared to be very responsible towards them.
 
 
[10] His mitigation is considerable and aggravation nil and in deference to the ethic of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I must do everything to promote the rehabilitation of this young man who has never offended before.
 
 
[11] I must also take note of the defilement and rape of such a young child whose progress to maturity has been inevitably impeded.
 
 
[12] I take a starting point for the first count of rape of twelve years. There is nothing to add for aggravating features but I deduct 2 years for his considerable mitigation, including his young age and clear record. 
 
 
[13] The resultant sentence of ten years is the sentence he will serve for each of the two rape sentences, sentences to be served concurrently with each other. 
 
 
[14] In the circumstances of the offending and the offender I decline to set a minimum term that he should serve before being eligible for parole.

On the 22nd September 2008 you had an argument with your elder brother in regards to the paying for the house labourers. The argument heated up and you tried to fight with the elder brother. The Complainant intervened and he pushed you away. Then you got hold of a glass dish and hit on the nose of the Complainant. The complainant received injuries and the matter was reported to the Police.

4. According to the medical report the Complainant had received a laceration on his nasal bridge and the doctor had commented that “the patient may have permanently deformed Nasal Bridge”. The Complainant had been treated in the hospital for two days.

5. In State v. Mokubula [2003]FJHC 164 Justice Shameem stated that;

“On the basis of these authorities, the tariff for sentences under section 224 of the Penal Code, is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. In a case of an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years, depending on the nature of the weapon. 

Aggravating factors would be:

1. Seriousness of the injuries;
2. Evidence of premeditation or planning;
3. Length and nature of the attack;
4. Special vulnerability of the victim;
Mitigating factors would be:
1. Previous good character;
2. Guilty plea;
3. Provocation by the victim;
4. Apology, reparation or compensation.”

6. In this case you attacked 67 year old your own father who was trying to settle the dispute between you and your elder brother. I consider that as an aggravating feature.

7. In mitigation you said that you are 42 years, single and a priest. You said that you seek forgiveness. You promised that you will not re offend. You further informed Court that you have reconciled with the Complainant and now live in the same house. 

8. Although you claimed to be a priest your conduct does not seem to fall in line with the conduct of a priest. In any event, the Complainant was present in Court and he confirmed reconciliation. However it should be noted that this is not an offence which can be reconciled. Besides you waited for five years until the date of the trial to inform that you have reconciled with your father. I do not see any remorse on your part. Furthermore domestic violence acts of this nature have been repeatedly denounced by Courts. In State V David Batiratu HAR 01/2012 Chief Justice Gates stated;

“There may have been association here with reconciliation. Reconciliation is maintained in the Criminal Procedure Decree [section 154]; it was originally provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code at section 163. The promotion of reconciliation applies only to charges for offences of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, criminal trespass or damaging property. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree provides a much more detailed section than its predecessor, taking into account appropriate forms of apology, respect for the victim, mandatory counselling, rehabilitation, promises and undertakings to alter habits or conduct, such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs. Most especially the court must be satisfied that reconciliation is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner. This approach gives proper protection to children, women, or vulnerable persons. It also indicates the need for awareness of improper pressures which might be exerted to force through reconciliation. I respectfully suggest the old cases, approving discounts in sentence for cases where the complainant wished to withdraw are no longer the correct approach’: See Rt Peni Baleidraiba Kevetibau v State (1992) 38 FLR 110.”

9. You have 4 previous convictions. However I disregard two of them as they are more than ten years ago. The incident happened in September 2008 and you pleaded guilty only when the case was taken up for trial on the 17th April 2012. I cannot consider your plea as a timely plea of guilt. 

10. In this case I pick my starting point as 2 years. For the aggravating feature I enhance the sentence by 6 months. For the mitigatory factors I reduce the sentence by 12 months. Accordingly I impose 18 months imprisonment on you.

11. In State v. Mokubula [2003]FJHC 164 Justice Shameem further stated that;

“As a matter of principle, a suspended sentence is not appropriate for a case of act with intent to cause grievous harm not only because it is contrary to the accepted tariff, but also because section 29(3)(a) of the Penal Code contains a legislative fetter to the section 29 powers to impose a suspended sentence for crimes of violence"".

12. However as at now sentencing of persons is regulated by the Sentencing and penalties Decree No 42 of 2009. Although the offence in this case is committed prior to the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, as per the transitional provisions set out in section 61 of the Sentencing and penalties Decree I decide that section 29(3) of the Penal Code has no relevancy anymore.

13. Yet I do not think that the circumstances of this case and the guidelines set out by previous Court decisions warrant a non custodial sentence to be imposed on you. The Courts have time and again shown disinclination to impose non custodial sentences for grievous harm charges.

14. In the circumstances I impose 18 months imprisonment on you.

28 days to appeal.

• Eroni Vakalevulevu, you were charged for the following offences by the Director of Public Prosecutions;
 

FIRST COUNT
Statement of offence
 
ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT RAPE: Contrary to Section 209 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, assaulted NASI VAKACEGU by punching her on the back with intent to commit rape.
 
 
SECOND COUNT
Statement of offence
 
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted NASI VAKACEGU by rubbing his penis on the body of the said NASI VAKACEGU.
 
 
THIRD COUNT
Statement of offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (c) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
ERONI VAKALEVULEVU, on the 16th day of October, 2015 in Nakorouto Settlement, Tailevu, in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of NASI VAKACEGU, with his penis without her consent.
 
  
• You pleaded guilty for all the above charges on 02nd December 2015 and you were convicted accordingly.
 
 
• According to the summary of facts;
  
• You are the stepfather of the victim who is 14 years old. On the 16th October 2015, while your wife and two children were attending a funeral in Naivicula village, you asked the victim who was staying at a Pastor's house at that time to come home with you. You then called her to the bedroom, you caressed her breasts and you forcefully undressed her. You told her to bend down to the floor and you rubbed your penis against her body.
 
 
• You then punched her back, strangled her neck, grabbed her hair and told her to suck your penis.
 
 
• You then held her neck to force her mouth to open and inserted your penis into her mouth.
 
 
• You stopped when you saw the victim crying.
 

 
• Section 209 of the Crimes Decree 2009, provides that the maximum sentence for the offence of Assault with intent to commit Rape is 10 years. In the case of Jone Tabaka v State [2013] FJHC 667, this court had endorsed an imprisonment of 1 to 4 years as the tariff for this offence.
 
 
• The offence of Sexual Assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJSC 1414, this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for Sexual Assault.
 
 
• The maximum sentence for the offence of Rape is imprisonment for life and the sentencing tariff for rape of a child is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, reads thus;
 

""If an offender is convicted of more than one offence founded on the same facts, or which form a series of offences of the same or a similar character, the court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of those offences that does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment that could be imposed if the court had imposed a separate term of imprisonment for each of them.""
 
  
• The three offences you are convicted of are based on the same facts. Therefore, in view of the provisions of section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I opt to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the three offences.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors;
  
• You are victim's stepfather. There is a breach of trust
 
 
• You are 20 years older than the victim
 
 
• There was planning involved and you used your authority to compel the victim to be alone with you during the time of offence
 
 
• You used violence on her
 

 
• I consider the following as your mitigating factors;
  
• You pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity
 
 
• Your counsel says you are remorseful
 
 
• You are 34 years old and married with 2 children
 

 
• In 2008, you have been convicted of the offence of attempted Rape. Therefore, I cannot consider you as a person of previous good character.
 
 
• I consider 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence. Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I add 7 years. Now your sentence is 17 years imprisonment.
 
 
• You pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Thereby, you saved Court's time and also prevented the victim from having to relive her ordeal by giving evidence in this Court. Therefore, you deserve a one third reduction of your sentence. I deduct 5 years and 8 months of your sentence for your early guilty plea and arrive at 11 years and 4 months. For the other mitigating factors, I deduct a further 1 year.
 
 
• I hereby sentence you for an imprisonment term of 10 years and 4 months. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 9 years of that sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.
 
 
• The offence of Rape attracts the highest term of imprisonment considering the other two offences you are convicted of and the above sentence is within the tariff of the offence of Rape when it comes to a child victim. Hence, I am satisfied that the above aggregate sentence of imprisonment does not exceed the total effective period of imprisonment had this court imposed separate terms of imprisonment for the three charges.
 
 
• Section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree reads thus;
 

""If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.""
 
  
• I note that you were first produced before the Magistrate Court on 19th October 2015. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served by you pertaining to the sentence imposed on you in this case. I hold that the period to be considered as served should be 2 months.
 
 
• Accordingly, the time remaining to be served is as follows;
 

Head Sentence – 10 years and 2 months
 
Non-parole period – 8 years and 10 months
 
  
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

 Particulars of Offence
 
 
JOSEVA QIOKATA on the 8th day and 9th day of September, 2010 at Nadi, in the Western Division inserted his penis into the vagina of JR without her consent.
 
  
• You pleaded not guilty to above charge. Following trial lasting three days in this Court, you were found guilty on above count against you.
 
 
• After considering the unanimous verdict of Guilty of the assessors and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial, the Court decided to concur with the verdict of the assessors and found you guilty of the above charge and convicted you.
 
 
• The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. The 22 year old victim JR was married with two children. She was 4 months pregnant. You are from the same settlement. You had invited the husband to go to a night club. You have left him there and come to the complainant's house. You forced open the door, dragged the victim out and raped her. 
 
 
• You had no remorse for your above conduct.
 
 
• You are not a first offender. 
 
 
• According to the Crimes Decree, the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for Life. It is a serious offence. The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates in State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.
 
 
• In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed 
 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
  
• Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 7 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Aggravating factors;
  
• (a) Victim is your neighbor, you breached the trust between neighbors
 
• (b) You are not remorseful
 
• (c) This is a planned offence 
 
• (d) The victim was pregnant
 


Considering all, I increase your sentence by 4 years, now the sentence is 11 years imprisonment.
 
  
• Mitigating circumstances;
  
• (a) Family depending on you and you are father of three children 
 

 
• Considering above, I reduce 1 year from your sentence now your sentence is 10 years imprisonment.
 
 
• You were in remand from 10.9.2010 to 28.9.2010 and again from 3.3.2014 to 26.3.2014 for a period of 41 days. I deduct that 2 months from your sentence. Now your sentence is 9 years and 10 months. 
 
 
• Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 8 years as non-parole period.
 
 
• You are sentenced to 9 years and 10 months imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 8 years of imprisonment.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

17,664,82570,"RULING ON APPEAL

The appellant appeals against the sentence imposed on him of 3 years imprisonment at Nadi Magistrates Court on the 19th February 2005.

Statement of Offence

ACT WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM: Contrary to section 224(a) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

MANUELI ROKOTUINAKELO, on the 6th day of February 2005 at Navakai, Nadi in the Western Division, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to VASENAI NAIVALULEVU, struck the said VASENAI NAIVALULEVU with a kitchen knife.

The particulars of the offence as accepted by you and as put before the Magistrate are that on Sunday, the 6th February 2005 at about 1130 hours you hit Vasenai Naivalulevu with a kitchen knife on her left thigh causing her grievous bodily harm. On that day, you and your wife were talking when an argument arose, she walked past you and you said to her not to show her black ass in front of you. She then called you names, you got very angry and you started punching and kicking her when she fell to the ground. You took a kitchen knife and stabbed her left thigh causing injuries. The matter was then reported to the police and she went to the hospital. You were arrested and charged. To you credit, you entered a plea of guilty on your first appearance in Court on the 19th February 2005.

Before the Learned Magistrate you said you were 43 years of age that you were sorry that you made a mistake that you lost your temper and got very angry. You now tell this Court that you and your wife have reconciled and whilst I acknowledged that this is not a reconcilable offence, certainly the fact that you and your wife have reconciled is a matter for the Court to take into account in mitigation.

You have prior convictions which include in recent years being drunk and disorderly and damaging property..

In State v Mokubula – HAA0052 of 2003S, Madam Justice Shameem said when considering the tariff for this type of offence that the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment depending on the nature of the weapon. Here the weapon is a kitchen knife. There is however here no premeditation, no planning and there is what might be considered some provocation by virtue of the argument that was occurring between you and your wife at the time.

I consider therefore in the circumstances that an appropriate starting point taking account of the aggravating factors to which I have referred is 4 years imprisonment. From that you are entitled to a discount of approximately one-third for your early plea of guilty and you are entitled to a further discount for having subsequently reconciled with your wife.

In the circumstances therefore I am of the opinion that an appropriate resultant sentence is 12 months imprisonment and accordingly the appeal is allowed, conviction is confirmed, I quash the sentence of 3 years imprisonment and in lieu thereof I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of 12 months.

• JONE TUBUNA, you were charged with one count of Act with Intend to cause Grievous Harm contrary to section 255(a) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. 
 
• You pleaded guilty for this charge on 19/07/2016 and also admitted the following summary of facts: 

On the 15th May 2016 at about 6.00am at Nadonumai Settlement, Lami, Jason Ramateni (hereafter PW1), 15 years old, student was sleeping inside his room when his father JoneTubana (hereafter “the Accused”) 46 years old, Businessman woke PW1 up to drive their vehicle registration number DH050 to go and buy beer for him and his friends.
 
Upon the arrival at home the Accused was sleeping. PW1 went back inside his room and slept. PW1 was then woken up by the Accused questioning him why they were late. PW1 informed the Accused that his friends had told him to go to the shop at Toorak to buy beer however the shop was closed, so they drove back to Lami to buy the beer.
 
The Accused then started to hit PW1 with an electrical cord, the accused hit PW1 on is bottom and his left calf several times that caused him injuries.
 
PW1 left his residence and went to his Aunt JieniCakacaka (hereafter PW2), 29 years old, Hotel Receptionist of Lot 14 Balolo Street, Narere.
 
PW2 reported the matter at the Nasinu Police Station, whereby PW1 was examined at the Raiwaqa Health Centre on the 15th May 2016. The medical report states that the injuries sustained are; thigh – back u shaped laceration/abrasion, skin peeled off around 8cm long, tender and U shaped on (L) lateral leg 12cm long. Tender. The doctor’s professional opinion was that it was caused by high intensity beating. 
 
The Accused was arrested and caution interviewed where the accused stated that he wacked his son because he took his car without permission. The accused was charge with 1 Count of ACT WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVIOUS HARM: contrary to Section 255 of the Crimes Decree Number 44 of 2009
  
• I am satisfied that your plea was voluntarily and unequivocal. Accordingly I convict you for this charge. 

The Law and the Tariff 
  
• The maximum penalty for Act with Intent to Cause Grievous Injuries under the Crimes Decree is life imprisonment. 
 
• In State v Drelinavai [2014] FJHC 309 his Lordship Justice Madigan said :

“The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. Various cases, but in particular MabaMokubula HAA0052of 2003, have held that the tariff for the offence must be from 2 years to 5 years imprisonment, and more in a domestic violence context.
 
In the Mokubula case, Shameem J. analysed several cases from the High Court and the Court of Appeal and concluded that in an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range between 2 years and 5 years, depending on the weapon used. She added that a suspended sentence in not appropriate. 
 
Although Shameem J. was considering an appeal of sentence for the identical offence under the Penal Code, the new offence under the Crimes Decree has the same maximum penalty and this Court does now confirm that the tariff is a term of immediate imprisonment from 2 to 5 years, and the nature and danger of the weapon used along with the injuries inflicted will be the determinants of where in that range the starting point is taken.”
  
• As for the starting point the UK Sentencing Guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non-domestic context. Therefore the starting point should be same irrespective of whether the parties are known to each other. 
 
• In Koroivuki v. State[2013] FJCA 15; AAU 0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Suresh Chandra said:

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.""
  
• Considering the gravity of offending and your culpability I select 02 years as the starting point for this sentence.

Aggravating Factors 
  
• In UK Guidelines following are considered as aggravating factors in domestic violence cases :  
• Abuse of trust and abuse of power ;
 
• Victim is particularly vulnerable ;
 
• Impact on children; 
 
• Using contact arrangements with a child to instigate an offence ;
 
• A proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting; 
 
• history of disobedience to court orders; 
 
• Victim forced to leave home  .

 
• When sentencing for a domestic violence a court in Fiji can consider the above aggravating factors and any other factors that would further aggravate the offence. 
 
• Section 4(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree has to consideralso by a sentencing court in a domestic violence offence. 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors in this case : 
• The victim is your son and by committing this offence you breached the trust placed on you by him ;
 
• You used an electrical cord to assault him several times ;
 
• The victim had to leave the home and go to his aunt home because of your beating. 

 
• For these aggravating factors I add 02 years to reach 04 years imprisonment. 

Mitigating Factors 
  
• The learned counsel from the legal aid filed a written mitigating submission and from that I consider the following :  
• Married with 7 children ;
 
• Sole bread winner of the family ;
 
• Remorseful. 

 
• For these mitigating factors I deduct 01 year to reach 03 years imprisonment. 
 
• Even though you informed this Court that you have reconciled with your son, this offence is not reconcilable and also there is no evidence before me to confirm that also. Therefore I do not give weight to that. 
 
• Further you have previous convictions and therefore not entitle for discounts for your character. 

Guilty Plea 
  
• In Naikelekevesi v The State Criminal Appeal No AAU 0061 of 2007 it was observed :

“...where there is a guilty plea, this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factors in a case”. 
  
• In UK Guilty Plea guidelines of 2007 it has been held that when an accused pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity the reduction is 1/3 and after a trial date is set 1/4 recommended. But when an accused pleaded guilty at the door of the court or after the trial has started he maybe entitle for only 1/10 discount.
 
• After getting proper legal advice you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and giving full credit for that I deduct 1/3 to reach 02 years imprisonment. 
 
• You were in remand for this case for nearly 01 month and pursuant to section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I deduct that period from your sentence to reach 23 months imprisonment. Even though the final sentence is below the tariff for this offence, the reason for that were the early guilty plea and the remand period of the accused. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend your sentence as request by your counsel in his mitigation. 
 
• Without any justification you assaulted your son just because he got late bringing beer to you and your friends in the morning. You used an electrical cord for the assault causing serious injuries. Further it was shown that previously you assaulted your wife and was on a bound over for that. Reoffending during the bound over also shows that you are not prepared to rehabilitate and also your family members are not safe from your violence. Hence a custodial sentence is warranted to denounce your behavior and deter you from committing violence against your close family members in future. 
 
• But I also note that you are the sole bread winner of the family and one of your daughters is presently studying in USP and need your support to continue with her education. Even though I have no sympathy for you, I am also mindful that full custodial sentence would be detrimental to your family and your children with their education .Considering all these circumstances I believe partly suspended sentence would be justifiable in this case. 
 
• JONE TUBUNA, I sentence you to 23 months imprisonment for one count of Act with Intend to cause Grievous Harm contrary to section 255(b) of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009. From that you have to serve 13 months in correction center and balance 10 months will be suspended for 03 years. 
 
• For the safety of the victim I also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
• Since this court is exercising the extended jurisdiction of the High Court case, the parties may appeal against this sentence within 30 days with leave to the Court of Appeal.

",1,1,1,0,2,sentence,1611
19,666,78929,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The appellants were each convicted on a charge of rape following a trial in the High Court at Suva. Each was then sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Both appealed against conviction and sentence. Both accused represented themselves at the trial. They were for a period represented by counsel on the appeal, who put forward written submissions on behalf of each of them and these were before the court. Counsel did not however appear at the hearing of the appeals and the appellants again represented themselves. 

The complainant in this case was 21 years old at the time of the trial. She alleged that on the 31st of December 1995 she went alone to Signals nightclub where she met two other persons, one of whom was Timoci Waitawa. She remained at the nightclub until closing time 1: 00 a.m. in the morning when she left with her friend and Timoci, together with certain other persons not known to her. She went with the others to Toorak by taxi and they got out of the taxi beside the Dudley church. They walked up Amy Street to Brewster Street. There were said to have been some ten persons in the group. She claimed to have walked away from the group and to have had sexual intercourse with Timoci. They then returned to the others in Brewster Street. She said that when they got back to the steps in Brewster Street they were empty. They returned to Amy Street when she saw a boy coming who said something to Timoci. This boy, she claimed, took hold of her and said he wanted to talk to her. She said she did not want to talk to him. She claimed that he held her hand and pulled her towards Brewster Street. She was shouting she did not want to go with him. She said that Timoci had disappeared. 

She said that she was pulled to the cassava patch behind the stairs where her friends had been. She said that there was a stone slab there from the remains of a house, that she was pulled there, pushed to the ground and fell onto the slab. She claimed that the boy tried to take off her underpants. She shouted for assistance and saw some more boys coming towards them through the cassava patch. She claimed that she saw a Fijian man who was strongly built, a very big man who came and said to “give herself”. Without going into further detail she claimed that she was forced by the first boy to have sexual intercourse with him which included penetration. After that intercourse had finished she stood up and put on her pants and she claimed then that a big man who had spoken to her before came towards her, pushed her to the ground, took off her pants and did the same as the first one, having sexual intercourse which included penetration. While the second man was still on top of her she saw a light approaching. Those approaching were police and their presence brought the incident to an end. 

The first ground taken on appeal involves an allegation that in his summing up, in referring to the question of demeanour the Judge’s comments to the assessors were unbalanced. The appellants claimed that in referring to the evidence of the complainant the Judge made a comparison between the possibility that she was a scheming devious girl or a soft feminine not overly robust girl, and then made the contrast as to how strong she would have needed to be to resist a man of the build of the appellants. The appellants complained that this part of the summing up appeared in the context of a reference to demeanour but had nothing to do with demeanour and was likely to unfairly influence the assessors. It is true that the comment appears in the context of a reference to demeanour but the context in the summing up was wider than this. The Judge was in fact referring to matters which the assessors could take into account in deciding whether or not they could rely upon the evidence of the complainant. The Judge put the matter on the basis that how the complainant appeared was a matter for the assessors. Although the comment does appear favourable to the complainant the Judge went on to remind the assessors that the appearance of the complainant at the time of trial might have been different from her appearance at the time of the alleged incidents pointing out that at the time of the trial she had just given birth. Such a comment was favourable to the appellants.

The appellants then submit that, although the Judge correctly advised the assessors of the necessity to reach a verdict beyond reasonable doubt, this was not specifically directed at the right of the appellants, nor did it take into account discrepancies in the evidence from the prosecution witnesses which might have led to such a doubt. We cannot agree with this submission and do not consider that the assessors would have been misled by the way in which this aspect of the summing up was put to them. 

The third point taken on appeal related to a lack of injury. The complainant said she was forced down onto a concrete slab. The Judge in his summing up noted that she did not have any injury which she might have been expected to sustain from a forcible placing onto a concrete slab which had projecting material, saying that this may have occurred on the slab or partly off the slab or “whatever”. The point taken by the appellants is that if she had been on the slab (as she had stated in her evidence) then the lack of injuries was a significant point in determining whether or not there had been consent to intercourse which had taken place. The Judge told the assessors to consider all those things. While his summing up may be interpreted as including an explanation favourable to the prosecution, this is not necessarily so, nor would it have been an improper exercise of the Judge’s obligation to refer to the material before the Court. The appellants took particular exception to the use of the term “whatever” and this was emphasised by Mr Vesikula. We do not think that this assists them. The question in the end is whether or not the assessors believed the evidence of the complainant overall. The absence of injuries was no doubt a factor to be taken into account but it is plainly only one aspect. 

The fourth point taken by the appellants relates to corroboration. They submitted that it was unfair of the Judge to advise the assessors there was a considerable amount of corroboration and in particular they complain that one of the aspects of the evidence which the Judge accepted as being corroborative was not as a matter of law corroborative. That was a reference to an admission by the appellant Sirinaturaga that he was there. His presence is a part of the prosecution case and the Judge was correct in accepting that it linked the appellant to the incident at least to some limited extent, even if it did not corroborate other necessary ingredients of the offence. The appellants complained that the Judge did not specifically state to the assessors that it was dangerous to convict in the absence of corroboration and cited authority to the effect that such an omission was serious. The Judge informed the assessors that they could convict without corroboration but went on to say that it was very advisable to look for it. The Judge specifically noted that there was only the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant that any intercourse which took place was without consent. While it is usual for the direction to include the word “dangerous” that is not essential provided the meaning is otherwise adequate and the assessors made fully aware of the dangers. (R v. Spencer & Others [1986] 2 All E.R. 928 (House of Lords)). We are satisfied that in the circumstances of this case and in the context of the summing up as a whole, the assessors could not have been left in doubt about the risk of convicting without corroboration. 

The fifth ground on which the appellants rely is that the Judge put too much emphasis on the distress of the complainant as material negativing consent. He said “the law says that distressed state is not something to be over-exaggerated by assessors. Certainly in a particular case it can be quite powerful. You might think it is here.” He then referred to the particular evidence. He went on to say “So you ask yourself is this all put on or is it a very genuine rape victim and you can take account of the distressed state on the question of consent or otherwise.” We do not think that this criticism of the summing up can be sustained. 

The sixth ground on which the appellants rely is one of balance. The appellants claim that the defence put forward by the first appellant is dealt with in 8 paragraphs out of a summing up which contains 133 paragraphs. The second appellant has his defence dealt with in two paragraphs. We do not think that a submission based on mathematical proportions such as this can succeed. While an unbalanced summing up amounting to real prejudice to the defendant may give grounds for an appeal, this is not such a case. The question is whether or not the defences were put and here they were. 

Finally the appellants relied upon an alleged inconsistency in the medical report. This point was further emphasised by the appellants at the hearing before us. The medical report is contained in a document of two pages. The first page refers to an allegation that the complainant had been raped by one Fijian man. It is the appellants’ contention that since this was patently contrary to the evidence of the complainant the Judge ought to have informed the assessors that it was a serious inconsistency. In fact the first page on which the statement appears is the police instruction to the Doctor. It was plainly not filled out by the Doctor who completed the medical report and his report quite expressly states that the complainant said she was raped by two Fijian men. The fact that the police docket refers to a rape by one Fijian man is a factor which the appellants might have raised as an inconsistency in a complaint to the police. But it was not so raised at the trial and is quite inconsistent with the other evidence from police officers. There is no substance in this ground. 

The grounds referred to above were those contained in a submission prepared by counsel who was then acting on behalf of both appellants. Those submissions were dated the 15th of March 2000. In November of 1999 grounds of appeal prepared by the appellant Sirinaturaga were filed. Those were of course prepared before the submission of Counsel on which the appellants relied in this Court. They were substantially in line with that submission but we note that they contain an allegation that the prosecution failed to tender in court a statement made by the complainant to the police. This is not referred to in the submissions made by counsel. In the absence of any direct reference to inconsistencies the failure to produce such a statement would not at this stage be sufficient to support the appeal. 

For the foregoing reasons the appeals against conviction cannot succeed and must be dismissed. 

Both appellants also appealed against sentence. The Judge in his sentencing remarks expressed in very strong terms his view of the behaviour of the appellants. Having had an opportunity to hear directly the evidence it plainly convinced him of the seriousness of what had occurred. In this case the complainant was held to have been raped by two men one after another in the presence of a number of onlookers. This is very close to gang rape which will always be regarded by the Courts as extremely serious. In the circumstances there were aggravating features which took this above the normal starting point for sentences for rape. We could not hold that the sentence as imposed was so excessive as to justify the interference of this Court. The appeals against sentence will also be dismissed. 

Result

The appeals against conviction and sentence are dismissed.

• TEVITA GAUNACA , you pleaded guilty to one count of Abduction of Person under 18 years to have carnal knowledge contrary to section 211(1) (a) of the Crimes Act No 44 of 2009(“Crimes Act”). 
 
•  You also admitted that on 20/03/2018 at Nabua you took the victim away from her father without his consent with the intention to have carnal knowledge. After the father reported the incident you were arrested and admitted to the police about this offence. 
 
• I am satisfied that your plea was made voluntarily and unequivocal. Accordingly I convict you for this charge. 
 
• The maximum penalty for Abduction of Person under 18 years of age with intent to have carnal knowledge is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
• In State v Kartik [2012] FJHC 840 his Lordship Justice Madigan held that tariff for this offence is from 12 months to 03 years.
 
• In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Goundar discussed the guiding principles for determining the starting point in sentencing in the following manner: 

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. 
  
• Considering the above judicial precedents and based on an objective seriousness, I select 20 months imprisonment as the starting point for this sentence. 
 
• There are no aggravating factors and in mitigation you submitted the following :  
• You are 20 years old;
 
• Single ; 
 
• Seeking forgiveness.

 
• In Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 003 of 2014) his Lordship Chief Justice Anthony Gates held that in Rape cases little weight can be given for personal mitigating factors of an accused. 
 
• In my view this applies to other sexual offences also and this also falls in to that category. Hence I disregard your personal mitigating factors. 
 
• But you are a first offender and for that, I deduct 04 months to reach 16 months imprisonment.  
• In Naikelekevesi v The State Criminal Appeal No AAU 0061 of 2007 it was observed :


“...where there is a guilty plea , this should be discounted for separately from the mitigating factors in a case”. 
  
• In Posate Rainima v The State , Criminal Appeal No AAU 0022 of 2012 the Court of Appeal said : 

“. It has always been accepted (though not by authorative judgment) that the ""high water mark"" of discount is one third for a plea willingly made at the earliest opportunity. This Court now adopts that principle to be valid and to be applied in all future proceedings at first instance.”
  
• You admitted to this offence in the police station and also pleaded guilty on the first day when you were produced in the court. Hence giving full credit for your plea I deduct 1/3 to reach 12 months imprisonment. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend your sentence pursuant to section 26(2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.  
• In State v Kartik [2012] FJHC 840; HAA003.2012 (7 February 2012) Justice Madigan said: 


“It is significant that the accused and the girl have known each other forsome time and wish to marry when legally able to do so. The accused is a first offender of young age, and no purpose would be served incarcerating him for this offence. The offence exists to protect young girls from predatory men with lascivious intent; but this was not the situation here. Despite the age difference it was the wish of both parties to spend the night together.”
  
• Facts in this case also show that the parties were in a relationship and the victim went with the accused and stayed with him in his village. The accused is first and young offender and prepared to accept the victim and the child from her previous relationship. Hence suspending this sentence would allow him the chance to rehabilitate whilst looking after the young family. 
• Accordingly I suspend your 12 months imprisonment to 02 years. 
 
• If you commit any offences during next 02 years you can be charge under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

21,668,78633,"SENTENCE

Luke Kata, you have pleaded guilty to one count of arson. On the 15th of March 2008 at Navua, you were drinking beer with your de facto wife and friends at the house of Henry Danford, occupied by you and your wife. After the drinking was over, you asked your de facto wife for sexual intercourse. She refused. You then asked her to buy you beer and she refused. You then had an argument and you set fire to a suitcase full of your wife’s clothes. She threw the suitcase outside and escaped out of the house. You then picked up the burning suitcase and threw it back into the house. You then ran after your wife.

The house burnt down completely. It was valued at $60,000 and contained furniture to the value of $10,000. It was insured.

You have 10 previous convictions, the latest being one for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in December 2002. In mitigation, counsel refers to the absence of an intention to injure anyone, and to your plea of guilty. He also said that the act of arson was out of character and that this offence should result in a non-custodial sentence.

The tariff for arson is 2-4 years imprisonment (Kelemedi Lagi & Others v. State [2004] HAA004/04S, Aporosa Tuitokova & Others v. State [2005] HAA67. Where a person lights a fire knowing that the result of such reckless conduct would cause a fire, sentences of around 3 years imprisonment have been imposed. A 2 year custody sentence in Amina Begum Koya v. State (1998) CAV0002/97 was upheld on appeal. In that case a fire was lit as part of an insurance fraud. Where the harm done is minimal, there have been sentences passed of 15 months imprisonment (State v. Inia Vulaono HAC 7/90).

In this case, the fire you lit destroyed the whole house belonging to your landlord. I commence at 3 years imprisonment. I take into account all mitigating and aggravating circumstances. I consider that an appropriate sentence after trial would be 3 years imprisonment. However, you have pleaded guilty and are entitled to reduction of the sentence on that basis. I reduce your sentence by one-third to 2 years imprisonment.

I decline to suspend your sentence. Although it is accepted that the house was insured, the result of your act is that the insurance company must now bear the cost of it. Further, a family has lost its home. In these circumstances I must sentence you to an immediate custodial term of 2 years imprisonment.

SECOND COUNT
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
 RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) and (3) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 JOSATEKI VAKACEGU on the 15th of February 2016, at Muslim League Settlement, in Nabua, in the Central Division, penetrated the vagina of AA, a child under the age of 13 years, with his penis.
 
 
[2] You pleaded not guilty to the above mentioned charges and the ensuing trial was held over 4 days. The complainant (AA), her grandmother, Mere Rokotuni, and a Medical Officer, Dr. Kelerayani Namudu, gave evidence for the prosecution.
 
[3] At the conclusion of the evidence and after the directions given in the summing up, by a unanimous decision, the three Assessors found you guilty of the first count of Rape, and found you guilty for the alternative charge of Sexual Assault in respect of the second count. Having reviewed the evidence, this Court decided to accept the unanimous opinion of the Assessors and accordingly found you guilty and convicted you for the offence of Rape, contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009 (“Crimes Act”), in respect of count one; and Sexual Assault, contrary to Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act, in respect of count two. 
 
[4] It was proved during the trial that, on the 15 February 2016, you raped the complainant, who was a child under the age of 13 years, by penetrating her vagina, with your finger. It was also proved that, on the 15 February 2016, you unlawfully and indecently assaulted the complainant, by placing your penis on the complainant’s external genitalia (her vulva), but without penetrating the external genitalia. 
 
[5] You are the granduncle of the complainant. The complainant was only 9 years and 11 and a half months of age at the time you committed the above offences on her, and as such, she was a juvenile. 
 
[6] The complainant testified in Court that when you were penetrating her vagina with your finger she had felt pain. She said your finger had been inside her vagina for a few minutes.
 
[7] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act No. 42 of 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”) stipulates the factors that a Court should take into account during the sentencing process. Section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act is reproduced below.
 
 “4. — (1) The only purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court are — 
 
(a) to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances;
 
(b) to protect the community from offenders;
 
(c) to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
 
(d) to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
 
(e) to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or
 
(f) any combination of these purposes. 
 
(2) In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to — 
 
(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 
 
(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;
 
(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;
 
(d) the offender’s culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;
 
(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 
 
(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 
 
(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;
 
(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;
 
(i) the offender’s previous character;
 
(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 
 
(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option.” 
 
[8] The offence of Rape in terms of Section 207(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. 
 
[9] The severity of the offence of Rape was highlighted by the Fiji Court of Appeal in the case of Mohammed Kasim v. The State [1994] FJCA 25; AAU 21 of 93 (27 May 1994); where it was stated:
 
 “It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage.” 
 
[10] In the case of State v. Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 16 of 2003S (23 April 2004); His Lordship Justice Gates stated:
 
 “Rape is the most serious sexual offence. The Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and meting out harsher sentences”.
 
[11] His Lordship Justice Goundar in the case of State v. AV [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192 of 2008 (2 February 2009); observed:
 
“Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children. Children are our future. The Courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences”.
 
[12]  In the case of State v. Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216; HAC 27 of 2011 (18 April 2011); His Lordship Justice Paul Madigan stated:
 
“Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.” 
 
[13] In the case of Anand Abhay Raj v. The State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 03 of 2014 (20 August 2014); Chief Justice Anthony Gates (with Justice Sathyaa Hettige and Madam Justice Chandra Ekanayake agreeing) endorsed the view that Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the acceptable range of sentences or sentencing tariff is between 10 and 16 years imprisonment.
 
[14] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, the Court of Appeal, in Laisiasa Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU 0018 of 2010 (5 March 2013); has formulated the following guiding principles:
 
 “In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.”
 
[15] In the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 10 years imprisonment for the count of Rape. 
 
[16]  The aggravating factors are as follows:
 
 (i) You are the granduncle of the complainant. 
 
 (ii) Being her granduncle you should have protected her. Instead you have breached the trust expected from you and the breach was gross. 
 
 (iii) There was a large disparity in age between you and the complainant. The complainant was merely 10 years of age and you were 47 years of age, at the time of the offence. 
 
 (iv) You took advantage of the complainant’s vulnerability, helplessness and naivety.
 
 (v) You have exposed the innocent mind of a child to sexual activity at such a tender age. 
 
[17] You are now 49 years of age, married with two children, who are aged 21 years and 18 years respectively. Your wife is said to be 3 months pregnant with your third child. You are said to be a construction worker, earning about $160 weekly. You are the sole bread winner of your family. It is the opinion of this Court that these are personal circumstances and cannot be considered as mitigating circumstances. 
 
[18] It is confirmed that you are a first offender. In terms of the Previous Convictions Report filed in Court, there have been no previous convictions recorded against you over the past 10 years. Therefore, this Court considers you as a first offender.
 
[19] Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 15 years imprisonment. As I have stated above, considering that you are a first offender, I deduct 3 years from your sentence for your previous good character. Your sentence is now 12 years imprisonment. Accordingly, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment for the offence of Rape.
 
[20] You have been convicted of one count of Sexual Assault in terms of Section 210(1) (a) of the Crimes Act (Second Count). 
 
[21] The offence of Sexual Assault in terms of Section 210(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
 
[22] In the cases of State v. Abdul Khaiyum [2012] FJHC 1274; Criminal Case (HAC) 160 of 2010 (10 August 2012) and State v. Epeli Ratabacaca Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012); Justice Madigan proposed a tariff between 2 years to 8 years imprisonment for offences of Sexual Assault in terms of Section 210 (1) of the Crimes Act. 
 
[23] It was held in State v Laca (supra) “The top of the range is reserved for blatant manipulation of the naked genitalia or anus. The bottom of the range is for less serious assaults such as brushing of covered breasts or buttocks.”
 
“A very helpful guide to sentencing for sexual assault can be found in the United Kingdom's Legal Guidelines for Sentencing. Those guidelines divide sexual assault offending into three categories:
 
Category 1 (the most serious)
 

Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia, face or mouth of the victim.
 

Category 2
 
 
 (i) Contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and another part of the victim's body;

(ii) Contact with the genitalia of the victim by the offender using part of his or her body other than the genitalia, or an object;
 
(iii) Contact between either the clothed genitalia of the offender and the naked genitalia of the victim; or the naked genitalia of the offender and the clothed genitalia of the victim.
 
Category 3
 
Contact between part of the offender's body (other than the genitalia) with part of the victim's body (other than the genitalia).”
 
 
[24] In this case it has been proven that you placed your penis on the complainant’s external genitalia (her vulva). This would clearly come under category 1 above, which refers to contact between the naked genitalia of the offender and naked genitalia of the victim. As such, in the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 4 years imprisonment for the offence of Sexual Assault, in terms of Section 210 (1) of the Crimes Act. 
 
[25] Considering the aggravating factors aforementioned, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 9 years imprisonment. As I have stated above, considering that you are a first offender, I deduct 3 years from your sentence for your previous good character. Your sentence is now 6 years imprisonment. Accordingly, I sentence you to 6 years imprisonment for the offence of Sexual Assault.
 
 [26] In the circumstances, your sentences are as follows: 
 
First Count – Rape in terms of Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Act - 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
Second Count - Sexual Assault in terms of Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Act – 6 years imprisonment.
 
 
I order that both these sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Therefore, your total term of imprisonment will be 12 years.
 
[27] Accordingly, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 12 years imprisonment. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 10 years of that sentence.
 
[28] Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act reads thus: 
 
 “If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
[29] You have been in remand for this case from 15 February 2016 up to the time you were enlarged on bail on 18 March 2016. Thereafter, you have been in remand custody since 25 April 2018, the day on which I delivered the judgment in this case. Accordingly, you have been in remand custody for a little over one month. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as period of imprisonment already served by you. I hold that the period of one and a half months should be considered as served in terms of the provisions of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 
[30] In the result, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. Considering the time you have spent in remand, the time remaining to be served is as follows:
 
 Head Sentence - 11 years and 10 and a ½ months. 
 
 Non-parole period - 9 years 10 and a ½ months. 
 
[31] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal if you so wish.

Calanchini P
 
[1] The appellant was charged with two counts of rape contrary to section 207(1) 2(a) and 2(b). The particulars of the first count were that between 1 and 31 May 2012 at Yalava the appellant penetrated the vagina of a girl (the complainant) age 11 years with his finger. The particulars of the second count were that between 1 and 31 May 2012 at Yalava the appellant penetrated the vagina of a girl (the complainant) aged 11 with his penis.
 
[2] Up to the commencement of the trial on 29 November 2013 the appellant had maintained his plea of not guilty to both counts. However after the complainant had been cross-examined the appellant changed his plea to guilty on both counts.
 
[3] The appellant was subsequently convicted on his plea of guilty to both counts. On 5 December 2013 the appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 11 years and 9 months on each count to be served concurrently with a non-parole term of 10 years.
 
[4] The appellant subsequently filed a notice of appeal against conviction and sentence which, although drafted and submitted to the Corrections Office within time, was filed about 21 days out of time. On 27 April 2015 the Legal Aid Commission filed an amended notice relying on one ground of appeal against sentence which provided:
 
“The Learned Trial Judge erred in principle and also erred in exercising his sentencing discretion to the extent that the non-parole period is too close to the head sentence resulting in much more severe punishment.”
 
[5] It would appear that the appellant had abandoned his appeal against conviction. Having read the transcript of the complainant’s evidence it would appear that there was no evidence before the court to establish the first count of rape by penetration of the complainant’s vagina with the finger. This omission was not the subject of either cross-examination or re-examination. In the summary of facts that was presented by the respondent to the Court after the appellant’s change of plea to guilty the incident is stated as follows:
 
“He then came on top of her and _ _ _ then used his hands to forcefully penetrate the complainant’s vagina. Afterwards he then forcefully inserted his penis into her vagina.”
 
[6] Although the material before the Court was not entirely convincing in relation to count 1 it must be acknowledged that the appellant as the adult who committed the offences was in the best position to recall what he had done on that day and as a result his unequivocal plea of guilty to both counts cannot be doubted. His subsequent appeal against conviction will be marked as having been abandoned and will be dismissed.
 
[7] On 13 August 2015 a judge of the Court granted an enlargement of time and lave to appeal against sentence.
 
[8] In his sentencing decision the learned Judge summarized the background facts which summary is now reproduced. The complainant was the appellant’s grand-niece as he and her grandfather are bothers. Between 1 and 31 May 2012 the appellant was visiting the complainant’s house to attend her grandmother’s funeral. Sometime during that period on a Saturday during the day, the complainant was in one of the three bedrooms while her cousins were watching movies in the living room. At that time the complainant was 11 years old and was in class 6. The appellant was in another room and called the complainant’s name. The complainant went to the appellant and asked him what happened. She was wearing a blue and white top, white vest, skirt, black tights and red underwear. As soon as she got to him, the appellant pushed her on to the bed in the room and as a result her skirt went up. He then came on top of her and forcefully removed her black tights and her underwear while leaving on her top. He then used his hands to forcefully penetrate the complainant’s vagina. Afterwards, he then forcefully inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt it was painful and also felt blood coming from her vagina. After about 10 seconds the complainant pushed the accused away onto the bed before grabbing her clothes and running away to her room.
 
[9] The ground of appeal is concerned with what is claimed to be the close proximity of the non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment to the head sentence of 11 years and 9 months imprisonment.
 
[10] The power to fix a non-parole period is set out in section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009. So far as is relevant to the present appeal section 18 states:
 
“18. – (1) Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
(2) If a court considers that the nature of the offence, or the past history of the offender, make the fixing of a non-parole period inappropriate, the court may decline to fix a non-parole period under sub-section (1).
 
(3) If a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for a term of less than 2 years but not less than one year, the court may fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
(4) Any non-parole period fixed under this section must be at least 6 months less than the term of the sentence.
 
(5) - (7) _ _ _”
 
[11] The sentencing court is required to fix a non-parole period which is at least 6 months less than the head sentence where the head sentence imposed is more than 2 years unless the court considers that the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender makes the fixing of a non-parole period inappropriate. The court is not required to give reasons for imposing a non-parole term since the requirement is mandatory. However the court is required to give reason if it considers it inappropriate to fix a non-parole term.
 
[12] There is authority for the proposition that the purpose of fixing a non-parole period is to record the sentencing court’s perception of the minimum term of imprisonment to be served before the offender becomes eligible for release: Zamfirescu v R [2012] VSCA 157, Kumora -v- The Queen [2012] VSCA 212, Naitini and Others –v- The State [2015] FJCA 154 AAU 102 of 2010 (3 December 2015). In Doreen Singh –v- The State [2016] FJCA 126 AAU 9 of 2013 (30 September 2016), this Court concluded that the earlier authorities stood for the proposition that:
 
“The non-parole period was intended to be the minimum period which the offender would have serve so that he or she would not be released earlier than the court thought appropriate, whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission.”
 
[13] It would appear that where a sentencing court considers it inappropriate to fix a non-parole term it is in effect saying that there is no minimum term that the offender is required to serve before being considered eligible for release. It is difficult to conclude that section 18(2) should be read as meaning that the decision not to fix a non-parole term requires the offender to serve the head sentence before being eligible for release. There is no basis for keeping the offender incarcerated once he has served the period of imprisonment imposed as the head sentence. In other words when the court considers it inappropriate to fix a non-parole term, the offender is eligible to be considered for parole at any time and furthermore any remission to which the offender is entitled is effectively calculated on the head sentence from the date the sentence is imposed not from the date of having completed the non-parole term of the sentence.
 
[14] In the present case the non-parole term was 1 year and 9 months less than the head sentence. Both the head sentence of 11 years 9 months and the non-parole sentence of 10 years are both at the lower end of the accepted tariff for rape of a minor.
 
[15] The offence of rape of young person related to the appellant is a serious offence. In this case the complainant was 11 years old and the appellant was her grand uncle (her grandfather’s brother). The authorities indicate that whilst rehabilitation is a factor to be considered when fixing a non-parole period, so also are deterrence, denunciation, condign punishment and community protection and expectations. The appropriate person to balance these objectives in each case is the sentencing judge. In the present case, given the age of the appellant, re-habilitation is not a particularly relevant matter whereas the expectations of the community and the protection of young girls should be reflected in both the head sentence and the non-parole term so as to send a strong signal that the counts will impose appropriate sentences in such cases.
 
[16] I do not consider that the sentencing judge has erred in fixing the non-parole term in the present case at 10 years and as a result I would dismiss the appeal.

The appellant was convicted in the Labasa Magistrates' Court for the following offence.

Statement of Offence [a]

RAPE: Contrary to section 149 & 150 of Penal Code Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence [b]

JOHN SAMUEL NAIDU on the 28th day of August, 2009 at Vunivere, Seaqaqa in the Northern Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of RAM DEI without her consent.

On his own plea of guilty appellant was convicted, and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He appeals against the said conviction and sentence on the following grounds.

1. The sentence ordered by the trial court is too harsh and excessive in nature.

2. That the petitioner had only been convicted on his guilty plea, and that the summary of facts did not contain evidence of the offence charged for a safe conviction by the trial court.

Ground 1

The offence of Rape carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Offence of Rape is a prevalent offence in Fiji. In this case the age of the victim is 78 years. She is a vulnerable member in the society.

In case of Drotini v State (2006) FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005S (24 march 2006) sentence of 11 years imprisonment, was affirmed for a rape of a step daughter.

In this case the victim is a 78 year old woman and it is a horrendous experience for a woman of that age, and is incapable of resisting such a sexual invasion. Therefore deterrent punishment is justified. The accused deserves much more severe punishment, but he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment as it was the maximum punishment that the Magistrate Court could impose.

Therefore the 1st ground, that the punishment is too harsh and excessive, is without merit.

Ground 2

After the plea of guilty the learned Magistrate convicted the accused Appellant upon admitting the summary of facts. Summary of facts which the accused admitted are filed of record and it contains full facts and elements of the offence of Rape.

The counsel for appellant submitted that the accused did not understand the charge. The learned Magistrate has read and explained the charge to the accused, and the record shows that the accused understood the charge.

When the right to counsel was explained to accused, Appellant had said that he did not need Legal Aid assistance and that he would defend himself.

After pleading guilty to the charge he admitted the summary of facts. The learned Magistrate has followed the correct procedure in dealing with the unrepresented accused. The learned Magistrate was satisfied that the plea of guilty by appellant was unequivocal. I see no reason to interfere with the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. 

Hence appeal against the conviction and the sentence is dismissed.

25,672,76588,"JUDGMENT
 
On 19th February 2001, the Appellant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment, on his plea of guilty, for the following offence:
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Act 17.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
SISA KANAVEILOMANI, on the 16th day of February, 2001 at Samabula in the Central Division, had unlawful carnal knowledge of AMANDA LELA without her consent.
 
The Appellant now appeals against sentence. At the hearing of the appeal, he also submitted that his conviction should be set aside because he was not legally represented.
 
The facts of the case, as outlined by the prosecution are that the accused, who is 42 years old, climbed into the bedroom of the complainant, Amanda Lela, on the 16th of February 2001. At the time, the complainant was 19 years old and a Form 6 student at Cathedral Secondary School. The Appellant entered the complainant’s bedroom between 5.30am and 6.30am, by climbing up a side wall to a balcony outside her room. He then entered her room. The complainant recognised him as a frequent visitor to the house, and brother to the lady with whom the complainant lived. She told him to leave, but he grabbed her hair and forced her to lie on the settee. He smelt of liquor. He muffled her mouth, undressed her and had sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. He then went to the kitchen to light a cigarette. The complainant got dressed, and complained to the owners of the house. The Appellant was then chased away from the house and the matter was reported to the police.
 
The complainant’s medical report, which was tendered by the prosecution in the Magistrates Court states that the complainant was distressed, some 4 hours after the rape. She had bite marks on her lips and breasts. On a genital examination, her hymen was found to be ragged, torn and bleeding. Semen was found in her vagina, and she found it too painful to walk. The doctor found that her medical condition was consistent with a sexual assault. Under the title “Any other relevant matters worthy of comment”, the doctor, presumably in answer to the question posed of her by the police on page 1 of the report, recorded “patient is not virgin.”
 
The Appellant was arrested and interviewed by the police. He said he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant, but that she had consented. He appeared in the Magistrates Court on 19th February 2001. He elected Magistrates Court trial. The charge was then read, and explained and the Appellant said he understood it. He pleaded guilty. The facts were read and the medical report tendered. The Appellant is then recorded as having said:
 
“Facts admitted: Yes we had sex. She did not consent. I didn’t know whether or not she was consenting.”
 
In mitigation the Appellant said he was 42 years old, separated from his wife, employed as a part time carpenter, said the complainant and he had had sex before, said he thought the victim did not like what he did and that he did not know if she consented, and asked for forgiveness. He said he has 6 children living overseas. He was convicted. The Learned Chief Magistrate said that the offence is serious, that he had taken into account the plea in mitigation, and that a custodial sentence was warranted. The Appellant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.
 
Conviction
 
In Surend Singh & Others -v- State Criminal Appeal No. 079 of 2000, I suggested a formula for magistrates to follow, to ensure that section 28 of the Constitution is complied with. When unrepresented accused persons appear in the Magistrates Court the magistrate must ask the accused if he/she wished to be represented by a lawyer. If the accused wishes then to proceed to plea without a lawyer, his answer must be recorded. He is then said to have waived his constitutional right to counsel. Unfortunately the learned Chief Magistrate did not follow the suggested formula in this case.
 
The Appellant now says he was prejudiced by the fact that he was unrepresented. Such a complaint will inevitably be made, when the court fails to inform an accused person of his right to counsel.
 
Having said that, however, I note that the learned Chief Magistrate was careful to ensure that the Appellant understood the charge, and that in agreeing to the facts, the elements of the offence of Rape were admitted to. The Appellant said that he did not care whether the complainant consented or not. The mens rea for Rape includes recklessness.
 
In the circumstances, I do not consider that the Appellant was prejudiced by the failure to inform him of the right to counsel. I also consider that his plea of guilty was unequivocal. The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
 
One last point. The medical report tendered by the prosecution records a statement that the complainant was not a virgin. It is not clear whether this was as a result of the rape, or whether this refers to previous sexual experience. Previous sexual experience is not admissible in a sexual offences trial unless the defence can show that such experience is relevant to the mens rea for rape. In other words, did the accused honestly believe that the victim was consenting, and was that belief based on his own consensual sexual experience with her? It is difficult to see how previous sexual experience could otherwise be relevant and therefore admissible. To ask this question of the doctor, and to tender the answer in the rape trial, or guilty plea proceedings, is doing the victim of the rape a great wrong. It is also evidence which is irrelevant and inadmissible and may allow the defence to cross-examine on previous sexual experience without having to show relevance. I would suggest that police officers filling out such reports refrain from asking questions about the victim’s sexual experience.
 
Sentence
 
The Appellant says that the sentence of 5 years imprisonment is harsh and excessive, and that more lenient sentences for rape have been imposed in the Magistrates Court.
 
State Counsel submits that the sentence is proper because of the Court of Appeal guidelines in Mohammed Kasim -v- The State Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993. She also submits that the Appellant was in a position of trust in relation to the complainant, that she was injured in the course of the rape and that there are no mitigating circumstances except for the guilty plea.
 
Different offenders in the courts who are convicted of the same or similar offence, do not always get the same sentence. Indeed in our system of sentencing which is based on individual offending (with the exception of offences which carry mandatory sentences) it would be surprising if all offenders got the same sentence. An offender is sentenced with regard to the seriousness of the offence, the character, age and antecedents of the accused, and with consideration for the totality of the offending.
 
Offenders convicted for rape will not always receive the same sentence. A first offender may get a considerably shorter term, than an offender who has previous convictions for rape. A man who rapes his daughter may receive a longer term than a juvenile who rapes his girlfriend. On the other hand, where a rape is particularly brutal, the circumstances of the offender may make very little difference to the length of sentence. The exercise of the judicial discretion in sentencing is not expected to result in a mathematical calculation designed to achieve consistent sentences. The judicial discretion is expected to be exercised to achieve consistency in approach to sentencing. It is for this reason that guideline judgments are useful. They set out the tariff, based on sentences imposed for an offence by the courts, and then set out matters which mitigate or aggravate the circumstances, requiring the sentencer to adjust up or down. This discretion must be exercised in a consistent manner in all cases, and because the sentencer is dealing with different individuals and circumstances each time, the result will obviously not be identical on each occasion. I set out these principles in some detail because it appears that the sentencing process is not well understood by appellants, many of whom complain of inconsistency.
 
Rape sentencing however, puts the Magistrate in a difficult position. The Magistrate is limited to imposing a term of 5 years imprisonment. In Mohammed Kasim -v- The State (supra) the Fiji Court of Appeal suggested a starting point of 7 years imprisonment. A magistrate cannot impose 7 years imprisonment because that exceeds his jurisdiction, and if there are no mitigating circumstances other than that of good character, he/she cannot refer the matter to the High Court for sentencing. What then is the Magistrate to do?
 
In Mohammed Kasim (supra) the Court of Appeal said at page 6:
 
“We should add a brief comment in respect of rape sentences imposed in the Magistrate’s Court. The maximum sentence in such cases for a single count is 5 years. It follows that ordinarily a Magistrate should commit a rape offender to the High Court for sentence unless there are clearly mitigating circumstances.”
 
However in Timoci Momotu -v- State Crim. App. No. AAU0018 of 1994, the Court of Appeal considered the powers of the Magistrate’s Court to commit to the High Court for sentence. The Court held (per Thompson JA and Quillam JA, Dillon JA dissenting), as follows:
 
“We come then to section 222(1) which we have set out earlier. This provides for the case of a trial which has proceeded in the Magistrate’s Court to the point of conviction, and the question as to the circumstances in which the Magistrate may then commit to the High Court for sentence. The words used are clear. The Magistrate may do so if, on obtaining information as to the offender’s character and antecedents, he is of the opinion that those matters (that is the character and antecedents) are such that greater punishment should be inflicted. Clearly this is additional to the circumstances and gravity of the offence, which have by then been established. The Magistrate must decide as a separate matter whether the character and antecedents disclose matters which make the offence a more serious one than the details of the offence itself have already shown.”
 
The majority decision of the Court of Appeal makes clear that “evidence of character and antecedents” is not limited to evidence of previous offending. Although the Court did not list matters which reflect on character and which would justify committal to the High Court for sentence, it is common sense that given the jurisdictional limit of the Magistrate’s Court, the broadest interpretation of matters reflecting on character, should be preferred. Matters such as an unsatisfactory employment or school record, a relationship of trust with the victim, and the previous convictions of the accused would all be matters which would fall within the scope of section 222. It is therefore desirable that the prosecution in the Magistrate’s Court tender an antecedent history of the accused before mitigation, setting out such relevant matters.
 
Of course, as the Court of Appeal suggested in Mohammed Kasim (supra) the Director of Public Prosecutions may decide to exercise his discretion under section 220 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to refer the matter to the High Court for a trial. However, if the accused wishes to plead guilty, he will have to wait for the Preliminary Inquiry process, and for Information to be filed, before he can plead. The delay may result in unfairness to accused and victim alike. The section 220 option may also not be possible if the relevant file has not been referred to the DPP’s Office by the police.
 
Turning therefore to the sentencing process, it is wrong in principle for magistrates to start at 5 years imprisonment, for an offence where the High Court starts at 7 years imprisonment. Irrespective, therefore, of the limits to their jurisdiction magistrates must, after hearing facts, antecedents and mitigation, start at 7 years imprisonment. The sentence must be adjusted downwards for mitigating circumstances such as the guilty plea. It must then be adjusted upwards for aggravating circumstances such as injuries to the victim. If having arrived at a proper sentence the sentence exceeds 5 years imprisonment, the magistrate must commit to the High Court for sentence, explaining the reasons (relevant to character) why he/she has decided to take that step. If, having arrived at a sentence, it does not exceed 5 years imprisonment, the magistrate can sentence in his/her own court.
 
The process therefore of sentencing for rape must be consistent whether the sentencer is a magistrate or a judge. The starting point in all courts must be 7 years imprisonment, and where the end result of the sentencing process exceeds the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court, the magistrate must commit to the High Court for sentence. Where however the accused has an unblemished character (considered in its broadest sense), then a committal for sentence is impossible, and any adjustment for good character and guilty plea must reduce the sentence to 5 years or less. Such an adjustment may result in a sentence which is manifestly lenient. However, such a result can only, after the decision in Timoci Momotu (supra) be cured by legislative reform. I would recommend the urgent attention of the authorities, to such reform.
 
Rape is a serious offence, and sentencing for rape is also a serious matter. The sentencing process must therefore reflect the seriousness of the case. As Gates J said in Ananaia Nawaqa -v- The State Miscellaneous Action No. HBM0014/2000L:
 
“In dispensing summary justice, a magistrate will find the handling of a rape case with as many as 8 accused, far from straightforward. Rape is one of the most serious cases for a Magistrate, indeed for any court, to handle. Such a case should be heard with special care and should not be rushed.”
 
What of this case? The learned Chief Magistrate’s sentencing remarks do not reveal whether he considered aggravating or mitigating circumstances which led to the adjustment of the sentence. However, the Appellant’s previous convictions for Drunk and Disorderly Behaviour are relatively trivial.
 
Starting at 7 years imprisonment, the Appellant was entitled to a discount of 1 year’s imprisonment for his guilty plea. However the violence used on the complainant, the invasion of the privacy of her own bedroom, and the age of the complainant, are all aggravating circumstances which warranted an adjustment up of 1 year. A sentence of 7 years imprisonment would have been justified, leading to a committal for sentence based on the accused’s previous convictions. However, this court cannot now impose a sentence which the lower court could not impose.
 
In all the circumstances the sentence imposed is not excessive and the appeal is dismissed.

26,673,244329,"SENTENCE
  
• Mr. Nand Kishore, you were charged with the following information and tried before three assessors.
 

Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
NAND KISHORE, on the 22nd day of April 2015 at Elevuka, Ba, in the Western Division, penetrated the vagina of KV, a child under the age of 13 years, with his finger.
  
•  Assessors unanimously found you guilty of Rape as charged. Court accepted assessors opinion and convicted you of Rape. You now come before this Court for sentence. 

3. The facts of the case in brief were that: 
 
The Victim was 8 years old at the time of the offence. She came back from school and went outside to play with her two sisters. You were renovating landlord’s house in the adjoining compound and called them to pour water on cement. Victim’s mother sent the Victim and her sister’s to help you. You then went inside landlord’s house and asked the Victim to pick rubbish in the room. The Victim went into the room, but there was no rubbish. You quickly closed all the windows of the room and told Victim to bend down and look properly. When she bent down, you pulled her shorts and poked her vagina with your finger. She screamed when she felt pain. She was frightened. She pulled up her shorts and ran outside. Then she reported the matter to her mother. Doctor who examined the Victim observed redness around her vaginal area and found her hymen not to be intact. In the caution interview, you admitted penetrating Victim’s vagina with your finger. 
 
4. The maximum penalty for Rape is life imprisonment. 
  
• Tariff for juvenile rape is now well settled. The Supreme Court in Anand Abhay Raj CAV003.2014 confirmed that the tariff for rape of a juvenile should be 10-16 years’ imprisonment. 
 
• Rape is a serious crime. By prescribing life imprisonment for Rape, the law makers expect Courts to impose harsher punishment on rape offenders. Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji. Courts and the society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children. Not only the offender himself but also the potential offenders must be deterred. The sentence must send a clear warning to the society. The offender must be severely punished and be incarcerated to ensure that our younger generation is safe and secure.  
• Having considered the gravity of the offending, I pick eleven (11) years’ imprisonment as the starting point. 


Aggravating Circumstances
 
 ➢ The age gap between the Accused and the Victim is nearly 51 years. In principle, the younger the child and the greater the age gap between the offender and the victim, the higher the sentence should be. 
 ➢ Victim’s mother sent the Victim to help you trusting you as an elderly carpenter. You breached that trust. 
 ➢ According to the medical report and Victim Impact Statement, Victim has suffered physically and psychologically. She lost her virginity at very young age. Offending left a scar and trauma for the rest of her life. 
 ➢ You have not saved the young girl from giving evidence and reliving the ordeal. 
 ➢ You planned to commit this offence. 

8. Mitigating Circumstances
 
 ➢ You admitted the offence and cooperated with police.
 ➢ You are a first offender and have maintained a clear record. 
 
• I add two (2) years to the starting point for above mentioned aggravating factors bringing the interim sentence to thirteen (13) years’ imprisonment. I deduct 1 year for the above mentioned mitigating factors bringing the sentence to twelve years’ (12) imprisonment. I deduct further 45 days to reflect your remand period. Your final sentence is 11 years’ and 9 1/2 months’ imprisonment.
 
• You are a 63 year old carpenter. The medical report tendered on your behalf shows that you are a cancer patient. Character certificates and letters filed by your Counsel show that you have been maintaining a good relationship with your villages and helping your community. It is unfortunate that you have committed this offence in your twilight years of your life. Court has no option but to send you to prison not only to punish you but also to deter others from committing this type of abhorrent crimes. 
 
• Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I impose a non-parole period of nine (9) years.

Summary
 
You are sentenced to 11 years and 9 1/2 months’ imprisonment. You are eligible for parole after serving nine (09) years in prison. 
 
12. 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
MOHAMMED HAKIK between the 1st day of November 2011 and the 31st day of November 2011, at Nadi in the Western Division, penetrated his penis into the vagina of FS, without her consent.
 
  
• You pleaded not guilty to above charge. Following trial lasting two days in this Court, you were found guilty on above count against you.
 
 
• After considering the unanimous verdict of Guilty of the assessors and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial, the Court decided to concur with the verdict of guilty in respect of the charge and also found you guilty of the charge.
 
 
• The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. Prosecution case was based on the evidence of the victim. She was 12 years old at the time of the incident. Accused is her step-father. The accused had asked the complainant to put her brother to sleep. Then accused had come and got inside the blanket. Then accused had removed her clothes and his clothes. Then accused had rubbed his penis on the private part of the victim. 
 
 
• Her step brother had seen the accused on top of the complainant and the blanket going up and down. He confirms the evidence of the complainant. According to the doctor medical findings are that the hymen was open and not intact. 
 
 
• The complainant and step brother had told the mother about the incident soon after the incident. But she had not taken any steps to report the matter to Police. When she informed neighbor she took them to the police station to make a report.
 
 
• In his caution interview the accused had admitted the offence.
 
 
• According to the Crimes Decree the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence. 
 
 
• The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates inState v Marawa. [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004). The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.
 
 
• In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed:
 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
  
• The tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 16 years. It was held by Court of Appeal in Raj v State [2014] FJCA 18; AAU0038.2010 (5.3.2014) Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years.This was upheld by the Supreme Court. 
 
 
• In State v Mario Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:
 

""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""
 
 
In this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter.
 
  
• In State v Anthony [2012] FJHC 1013; HAC 151.2010 Hon. Mr. Justice Priyantha Nawana held that:
 

""The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl of MB's standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in case of this nature, deterrence is therefore, of paramount importance."" 
 
  
• Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment for the charge of Rape.
 
 
• The aggravating factors are:
  
• (i) Serious breach of trust by the victim towards you as step-father
 
• (ii) Victim is of young age the age gap is more than 20 years
 
• (iii) Lack of remorse, You let the victim relive her experience in Court,
 
• (iv) You took advantage of the victim's vulnerability
 

 
• I add four years for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 15 years.
 
 
• The mitigating factors are:
  
• (i) At the age of 38 you are first offender 
 

 
• I deduct 1 year for the above mitigating factor. Now the sentence is 14 years.
 
 
• You were in remand from 4.12.2011 to 30.1.2012 for a period of 2 months after conviction for a period of 13 days. That period to be deducted from your sentence acting under Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. Now your sentence is 13 years 9 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• Considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 11 years as non- parole period.
 
 
• Having considered the Domestic nature of the relationship you had with the victim, I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) in place, identifying victim FS as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any contact with the victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.
 
 
• Your sentences are as follows:
  
• (i) Count of Rape - 13 years 9 months
 


Summary
 
  
• You are sentenced to 13years 9 monthsimprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving11years of imprisonment.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

COUNT 4
 
Statement of Offence
 
 RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
JOSEFA VODONAYALEWA between the 1st day of December 2013 and the 31st day of December 2013, at Gau Island in the Central Division, penetrated the vagina of JK with his penis, without her consent. 
 
 
[2] You pleaded not guilty to the above mentioned charges and the ensuing trial was held over 3 days. The complainant, JK, an Assistant Pastor (lay Pastor), Semi Vueti, and Waisake Yavala Dakai, a Minister of the Methodist Church gave evidence for the prosecution. 
 
 [3] At the conclusion of the evidence and after the directions given in the summing up, by a unanimous decision, the three Assessors found you guilty of all four charges. Having reviewed the evidence, this Court decided to accept the unanimous opinion of the Assessors and found you guilty and convicted you of the said charges. 
 
[4] It was proved during the trial that, between 1 August 2013 and 31 August 2013, at Gau Island, you unlawfully and indecently assaulted JK by fondling her breasts.
 
[5] It was also proved during the trial that, during the period 1 August 2013 and 31 August 2013, at Gau Island, you penetrated the vagina of JK with your finger, without the consent of the complainant and that you knew or believed that the complainant was not consenting, or that you were reckless as to whether or not she was consenting. 
 
[6] It was further proved during the trial that, during the period 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2013, at Gau Island, you penetrated the vagina of JK with your tongue, without the consent of the complainant and that you knew or believed that the complainant was not consenting, or that you were reckless as to whether or not she was consenting.
 
[7] And finally it was proved that, during the period 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2013, at Gau Island, you penetrated the vagina of JK with your penis, without the consent of the complainant and that you knew or believed that the complainant was not consenting, or that you were reckless as to whether or not she was consenting.
 
[8] You are the paternal grandfather of the complainant. The complainant was only 14 years and 9 months of age, as at August 2013, and four months older in December 2013, the time you committed the above offences on her (her date of birth is 25 October 1998), and as such, she was a juvenile. 
 
[9] The complainant clearly testified that during the month of August 2013, you unlawfully and indecently assaulted her by fondling her breasts. She testified that during the course of the same incident you had penetrated her vagina, with your finger, without her consent.
 
[10] The complainant further testified that during the month of December 2013, you had penetrated her vagina, with your tongue, without her consent. During the course of the same incident you had penetrated her vagina, with your penis, without her consent.
 
[11] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act No. 42 of 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”) stipulates the relevant factors that a Court should take into account during the sentencing process. I have duly considered these factors in determining the sentence to be imposed on you.
 
[12] The offence of Rape in terms of Section 207(1) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009 (“Crimes Act”) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. 
 
[13] The severity of the offence of Rape was highlighted by the Fiji Court of Appeal in the case of Mohammed Kasim v. The State [1994] FJCA 25; AAU 21 of 93 (27 May 1994); where it was stated:
 
 “....It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage.” 
 
[14] In the case of State v. Marawa [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 16T of 2003S (23 April 2004); His Lordship Justice Anthony Gates stated:
 
 “Parliament has prescribed the sentence of life imprisonment for rape. Rape is the most serious sexual offence. The Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime by hardening their hearts to offenders and meting out harsher sentences”.
 
“A long custodial sentence is inevitable. This is to mark the gravity of the offence as felt, and correctly so, by the community. Imprisonment emphasizes the public’s disapproval and serves as a warning to others who may hitherto regard such acts lightly. One must not ignore the validity of the imposition of condign punishment for serious crime. Lastly the sentence is set in order to protect women from such crimes: Roberts and Roberts (1982) 4 Cr. App R(S) 8; The State v Lasaro Turagabeci and Others (unreported) Suva High Court Crim. Case No. HAC0008.1996S.”
 
 
[15] In The State v Lasaro Turagabeci and Others (supra) Pain J had said:
 
“The Courts have made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.”
 
[16] His Lordship Justice Daniel Goundar, in the case of State v. AV [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192 of 2008 (2 February 2009); observed:
 
“....Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children. Children are our future. The Courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences”.
 
[17] In the case of State v. Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216; HAC 27 of 2011 (18 April 2011); His Lordship Justice Paul Madigan stated:
 
“Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.” 
 
[18] In the case of Anand Abhay Raj v. The State [2014] FJSC 12; CAV 03 of 2014 (20 August 2014); Chief Justice Anthony Gates (with Justice Sathyaa Hettige and Madam Justice Chandra Ekanayake agreeing) endorsed the view that Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the acceptable range of sentences or sentencing tariff is between 10 and 16 years imprisonment.
 
[19] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, the Court of Appeal, in Laisiasa Koroivuki v. State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU 0018 of 2010 (5 March 2013); has formulated the following guiding principles:
 
 “In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.”
 
[20] In the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 10 years imprisonment for the second count of Rape (Count 2). 
 
[21] The aggravating factors are as follows:
 
 (i) You are the paternal grandfather of the complainant. Her father had passed away in the year 2000. Thereafter, her mother had remarried. You and your wife have taken care of the complainant since then. The complainant considered you as her own father. 
 
 (ii) Being her grandfather you should have protected her. Instead you have breached the trust expected from you and the breach was gross. 
 
 (iii) There was a large disparity in age between you and the complainant. The complainant was merely 14 years of age at the time you first committed the offences on her (and had just turned 15 when you committed the offences set out in Counts 3 and 4). At the time you were 63 years of age. Therefore, there was a difference in age of nearly 50 years. 
 
 (iv) You took advantage of the complainant’s vulnerability, helplessness and naivety.
 
 (v) You have exposed the innocent mind of a child to sexual activity at such a tender age. 
 
 (vi) You are convicted of multiple offending. 
 
[22] You are now 68 years of age, married and residing with your wife and granddaughter. You are said to be having a hip problem and finding it hard to walk and you require the assistance of a walking stick. These are all personal circumstances and cannot be considered as mitigating circumstances. 
 
[23] As per the Antecedent Report filed it was submitted by the State there are no previous convictions recorded against you. Therefore, this Court considers you as a person of previous good character.
 
[24] Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 15 years. Considering your previous good character, I deduct 2 years from your sentence. Your sentence is now 13 years imprisonment for Count 2. 
 
[25] Similarly, in the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 10 years imprisonment for the third count of Rape (Count 3). 
 
[26] Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, which are common for all offences, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 15 years. Considering your previous good character, I deduct 2 years from your sentence. Your sentence is now 13 years imprisonment for Count 3. 
 
[27] Similarly, in the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 10 years imprisonment for the fourth count of Rape (Count 4). 
 
[28] Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, which are common for all offences, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 15 years. Considering your previous good character, I deduct 2 years from your sentence. Your sentence is now 13 years imprisonment for Count 4. 
 
[29] The offence of Indecent Assault in terms of Section 212 of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. 
 
[30] As held in Ratu Penioni Rokota v. State [2002] FJHC 168; HAA 68J of 2002S (23 August 2002); the applicable tariff for the offence of Indecent Assault is 12 months to 4 years imprisonment. This was followed by His Lordship Justice Vinsent Perera in State v. Mohammed Zubair [2017] FJHC 895; HAC 425 of 2016 (24 November 2017).
 
[31] In the light of the above guiding principles, and taking into consideration the objective seriousness of the offence, I commence your sentence at 12 months imprisonment for the first count of Indecent Assault.
 
[32] Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors, which are common for all offences, I increase your sentence by a further 5 years. Now your sentence is 6 years. Considering your previous good character, I deduct 2 years from your sentence. Your sentence is now 4 years imprisonment for Count 1. 
 
[33] In the circumstances, your sentences are as follows:
 
Count 1- Indecent Assault contrary to Section 212 (1) of the Crimes Act - 4 years imprisonment.
 
Count 2- Rape contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act – 13 years imprisonment.
 
Count 3- Rape contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act – 13 years imprisonment.
 
Count 4- Rape contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act – 13 years imprisonment.
 
 
I order that all four sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Therefore, your total term of imprisonment will be 13 years.
 
[34] The next issue for consideration is whether this Court should grant you any concessions due to your advanced age. 
 
[35] In State v. Spowart [2013] FJHC 352; HAC 89 of 2011 (24 July 2013), His Lordship Justice Madigan had sentenced a 74 year old man to a term of imprisonment of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 4 years, for the Rape of a 5 year old girl. 
 
[36] Similarly in State v. Banuve [2016] FJHC 320; HAC 183 of 2015 (25 April 2016), His Lordship Justice Aluthge sentenced a 72 year old man to a term of imprisonment of 8 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years, for the Rape of an 8 year old girl.
 
[37] Having perused the said authorities, I am of the opinion that the said two cases must be distinguished from the present case. This is due to the fact that in both those cases the accused had entered a guilty plea at the first available opportunity, thereby showing genuine remorse and, more importantly, relieving the complainants in the said cases from giving evidence in Court.
 
[38] In State vs. Cati [2016] FJHC 705; HAC 224 of 2015 (5 August 2016), His Lordship Justice Perera in sentencing a 74 year old man to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, for the causing the Rape of a 4 year old girl, held as follows:
 
 
“It stands to reason that a term of imprisonment will bring you immense hardship given your old age and your impaired hearing. However, the harm you have done to the victim and to her future is not outweighed by the hardship you may endure in serving a prison term. The victim who is 8 years old now will suffer throughout her remaining lifetime due to your shameful conduct.”
 
[39] Her Ladyship Madam Justice Nazhat Shameem in the case of Rokota v. The State [2002] FJHC 168; HAA 68J of 2002S (23 August 2002) (supra) held as follows:
 
 
“...However, the Appellant is 64 years old. There are special sentencing principles for the sentencing of the elderly, particularly those of previous good character.”
 
 
[40] Making reference to Principles of Sentencing (2nd Edition), by D. A. Thomas, Her Ladyship said: 
 
“Recognition of age as a mitigating factor does not mean that imprisonment should never be imposed on elderly offenders, and the Court has upheld sentences of imprisonment on men in their seventies. It is however a long-established principle that a sentence should normally be shortened so as to avoid the possibility that the offender will not live to be released.”
 
[41] Considering all the facts and circumstances of this case, especially the fact that the victim herself was merely 14 years of age at the time of the incident, I am not inclined to reduce the primary sentence or head sentence I am imposing on you. 
 
[42] Accordingly, I sentence you to a term of 13 years imprisonment. 
 
[43] However, in determining the non-parole period to be imposed on you, I have given due consideration to your advanced age and to the fact that you are having a disability in walking. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act, I fix your non-parole period as 9 years imprisonment. 
 
[44] In doing so I have taken into consideration the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Tora v. State [2015] FJCA 20; AAU 63 of 2011 (27 February 2015), which was upheld by the Supreme Court in Tora v. State [2015] FJSC 23; CAV 11 of 2015 (22 October 2015).
 
[45] Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act reads thus: 
 
 “If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
[46] You have been in remand custody from 21 December 2015 to 24 July 2017, when you were granted bail by this Court. Thereafter, you have been in remand custody since 4 July 2018, the day on which I delivered the Judgment in this case. Accordingly, you have been in custody for a total period of more than 1 year and 7 months. The period you were in custody shall be regarded as period of imprisonment already served by you. I hold that a period of 1 year and 8 months should be considered as served in terms of the provisions of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 
[47] In the result, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. Considering the time you have spent in remand, the time remaining to be served is as follows:
 
 Head Sentence - 11 years and 4 months.
 
 Non-parole period - 7 years and 4 months.
 
[48] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal if you so wish.

",1,1,0,1,2,sentence,3209
29,676,271656,"RULING
 
 
[1] The appellant was charged with a representative count of rape contrary to section 207(1)(2)(b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree. It was alleged that between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2011, the appellant had a carnal knowledge of the complainant without her consent. The complainant was a student at the Gospel School for the Deaf. She had hearing and speech impediment and was 16 years old at the time of the offence. She resided at the hostel run by the School. The appellant and his wife were the wardens of the hostel. Apart from being the warden, the appellant was also a bible teacher at the School.
 
 
[2] The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge. On 26 July 2013, he was convicted of the charge after a trial. At trial, the appellant was represented by two senior counsel, Mr. Nawaikula and Mr. Vere. On 31 July 2013, the appellant was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years by the High Court.
 
 
[3] On 7 October 2013, he filed a Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence. That Notice is dated 23 August 2013, but the Department of Corrections did not forward the Notice to the Court of Appeal Registry until 7 October 2013, by which time the appeal was out of time by about one month.
 
 
[4] On 20 November 2014, the appellant filed an amended Notice of Appeal through his legal aid counsel. The amended Notice contains only one ground of appeal and that ground relates to the appellant's conviction.
 
 
[5] The ground of appeal states:
 
 
 ""The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he allowed in evidence the history given to the doctor by the complainant considering it was hearsay evidence thereby causing a miscarriage of justice.""
 
 
[6] Fortunately, the judge's notes have been typed and were made available to me for the purpose of leave hearing.
 
 
[7] It is clear that the appellant's proposed ground of appeal is not arguable for three main reasons. Firstly, the appellant's trial counsel did not take any objection to the admissibility of the medical history evidence at trial. Secondly, the court record shows that both the complainant and the doctor who examined her gave evidence at trial. Thus, the medical history that the complainant related to the doctor was not hearsay evidence. Both the doctor and the complainant could have been cross-examined on the history that the complainant gave to the doctor. Thirdly, the appellant was not convicted on the medical history evidence, but on the complainant's evidence led at trial. The conviction appeal on this ground is therefore not arguable.
 
 
[8] Although the appellant has not advanced any grounds against sentence, perusal of the trial judge's sentencing remarks show some arguable grounds. Unfortunately, counsel for the appellant has not seen fit to appeal against sentence. The arguable grounds relate to the factors that the trial judge identified to increase the appellant's sentence. The aggravating factors identified by the trial judge in summary are:
 
 
(i) Para 11 of sentencing remarks – the appellant's position of authority – add 3 years to sentence.
 
 
(ii) Para 12 of sentencing remarks – the breach of trust – add 3 years to sentence.
 
 
(iii) Para 13 of sentencing remarks – opportunistic crime – add 2 years to sentence.
 
 
(iv) Para 14 of sentencing remarks – pre-planning involved and several sexual acts involved – add 1 year to sentence.
 
 
(v) Para 15 of sentencing remarks – lack of remorse – add 1 year to sentence.
 
 
[9] The appellant's position of authority and the breach of trust arose from a common fact, namely, that the appellant was the complainant's teacher and guardian at the school and the hostel. Arguably, the appellant was punished twice based on the same fact. The trial judge further contradicts himself by saying this was both an opportunistic and pre-planned crime. Furthermore, although the appellant was charged with a representative count, he was convicted of one sexual act and not several as considered by the trial judge. Arguably, the appellant was sentenced for un-convicted crimes. The lack of remorse arose because the appellant elected to exercise his right to a trial. Arguably, he cannot be punished for exercising his right.
 
 
[10] For these reasons, the appeal against sentence is arguable.
 
 
Result
[11] Extension of time is granted. 
 
 
[12] Leave to appeal against conviction is refused.
 
 
[13] Leave to appeal against sentence is allowed.

30,677,76655,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] Following a trial in the Magistrates’ Court, the appellant was convicted of insulting the modesty of a female contrary to section 154(4) of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years.

[2] At the trial, the victim gave evidence. She was 14 years old at the time of the offence. The appellant was her neighbour. On the day in question, the victim went to a corner shop where the appellant pulled her from behind and proposed to marry her and invited her to accompany him to a motel to have sex. He said to her that if she refused he would rape and throw her in a river. The victim was offended by what the appellant said to her. She immediately reported the incident to her mother and then to the police. 

[3] The appellant also gave evidence. He said it was the victim who made sexual gestures to him and wanted to marry him. He denied the allegations that he insulted the modesty of the victim.

[4] The learned trial Magistrate believed the evidence of the victim and convicted the appellant.

[5] The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence to the High Court. He founded his grounds of appeal against conviction by challenging the findings of fact of the learned trial Magistrate. Further, he contended that his sentence was excessive.

[6] The High Court did not find any merit in the appeal, and on 6 August 2007, dismissed it.

[7] The appellant then filed an appeal to this Court. On 23 May 2008, Byrne JA refused leave to appeal after concluding the grounds of appeal were without merit.

[8] The appellant now seeks leave to appeal from the full Court.

[9] In his written and oral submissions, the appellant challenges the findings of fact made by the learned trial Magistrate to convict him. He made no submission on sentence.

[10] Section 22 of the Court of Appeal Act (Cap. 12) governs appeals from the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction to this Court. Sub-section (1) provides:

""Any party to an appeal from a Magistrates’ Court to the High Court may appeal, under this Part, against the decision of the High Court in such appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law only.""

[11] Sub-section (1A), added to the Act by the Court of Appeal (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998, provides:

""(1A) No appeal under subsection (1) lies in respect of a sentence imposed by the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction unless the appeal is on the ground –

(a) that the sentence was an unlawful one or was passed in consequence of an error of law; or

(b) that the High Court imposed an immediate custodial sentence in substitution for a non-custodial sentence.""

[12] We have considered the submissions of the appellant. We are satisfied that none of the grounds raised by him constitute an error of law only. It therefore follows that the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. Leave to appeal cannot be properly given in a case where the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. That is the situation here.

[13] For the reasons given, we conclude Byrne JA was correct to refuse leave to appeal.

ORDER

[14] Leave to appeal refused.

The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following charge in the Suva Magistrate’s Court.

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Cap 17.

Particulars of Offence

MANOJ KUMAR s/o Krishna Goundar on the 14th day of October 2002 at Suva in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely ASHNA NAMRATA SINGH d/o Virendra Singh aged 5 years.

He was sentenced on the 3rd of December 2002 to a 9 month sentence of imprisonment, suspended for 3 years. The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against this sentence on the grounds that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle, and was manifestly lenient.

The charge was laid on the 17th of October 2002. The Respondent pleaded not guilty, and was remanded in custody. On 14th November 2002, he changed his plea to one of guilty. He was represented by counsel. The facts were that on the 14th of October 2002, the victim was 5 years and 7 months old. On that day, she accompanied her uncle to visit neighbours to watch a video. The Respondent who is 30 years old, was also there watching the video and drinking beer. At 11.45pm the victim went outside to urinate. The Respondent followed her and took her into a tool room. He turned off the outside light, made the victim lie down, touched her breasts, pulled off her pants and rubbed his fingers over her vagina. The victim’s father and uncle started to look for her. They checked the tool room and found it locked. They then saw the accused running away from the tool room, and found it locked. They found the victim inside crying. She told her uncle what had happened and the matter was reported to the police. The victim was examined by a doctor, who found a small abrasion on the hymen, with minimal bleeding. The history related to the doctor by the victim was that the Respondent had forced her onto the bed in the tool room, closed her mouth with one hand, pulled her shorts down and took off his own shorts. He then punched her on the stomach, thigh and chest and penetrated her vagina with two fingers. He fondled her private parts, and kissed her.

The Respondent admitted the offence when he was interviewed by the police. He admitted the facts outlined in court. The record shows that he read the medical report, as did counsel.

In mitigation, counsel submitted that he had not intended to commit the offence but had followed her “to check she had completed urination.” She said that he was married with two daughters and expressed remorse. He had one previous conviction in 1991, but was treated as a first offender.

The learned Magistrate then made the following sentencing remarks:

“Accused is a first offender. He has pleaded guilty in the first instance. He appears remorseful. He was remanded in custody pending sentence. His term in remand will have been a lesson to him. He has also assisted the court in pleading guilty in the first instance. Persuasive mitigation by counsel from Legal Aid has assisted the accused. He is severely warned for the offence. In consideration of the principles of sentencing including deterrence, the accused is sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 3 years with effect from today.

Suspended sentence explained.”

In his comprehensive, and well-researched submissions, counsel for the State outlined the principles of sentencing in cases of the sexual assault of children. He argued firstly that section 29(3)(a) of the Penal Code, expressly provided that a sentence must not be suspended in cases of indecency towards children. Secondly he submitted the sentences for indecent assault in Fiji ranged from 1 year to 4 years imprisonment, and that relevant factors determining sentence were the age difference between offender and victim, the penetrative nature of the assault, and any betrayal of trust. He suggested that a 3 year sentence would reflect the nature of the offending in this case.

The Respondent asked for his non-custodial sentence to remain, saying that a custodial sentence will result in hardship for his family.

The suspended sentence

Section 29(3) of the Penal Code provides:

“A court which passes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of not more than six months in respect of one offence shall not make an order under the provisions of subsection (1) where –

(a) the act or any of the acts constituting that offence consisted of an assault on or threat of violence to another person or having or possessing a firearm, an imitation firearm, an explosive or an offensive weapon or of indecent conduct with or towards a person under the age of sixteen years.”

This subsection appears to apply to prevent the suspension of a sentence, where the sentence of imprisonment is for less than 6 months, and the offence committed is one of indecency to children. Fatiaki J in DPP –v- Saviriano Radovu Crim. App. No. HAA0006 of 1996 considered this provision in an appeal by the State against a suspended sentence imposed for the indecent assault of an 8 year old child. In that case the sentence imposed was 9 years imprisonment suspended for 18 months and a fine of $30.00. His Lordship held that whilst it appeared that the limitation to section 29 applied only to sentences below 6 months imprisonment:

“I cannot accept that in expressly excluding such acts from the operation of subsection (1) of section 29, the legislature was concerned only with the length of sentence imposed and not with the nature or type of offence committed. Quite plainly it was. If this were not so, one would have the rather extraordinary situation where serious offending such as Attempted Armed Robbery, where a prison sentence under 2 years was imposed could technically be suspended, whereas a misdemeanour of Being in Possession of an Offensive Weapon in a Public Place could not be suspended if the trial magistrate imposed a sentence of less than 6 months.”

Further, at page 7, he pointed out that the entire purpose of the limitations imposed by section 29(3)(a) could be circumvented by imposing a sentence longer than 6 months in order to suspend it. He held that the whole of section 29 must be read together and that a court was therefore prevented from suspending the sentence of any offender convicted of the offences set out therein, irrespective of the length of the sentence.

On a careful reading of section 29(1)(a) of the Code, the reference to sentences of less than 6 months imprisonment is difficult to understand. Further, whilst section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (U.K.) had a similar provision, (although as Fatiaki J said in Saviriano Radovu (supra), with quite a different effect) its successor, the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 (U.K.) has no such limitation. Further section 118 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides as follows:

“(4) A court shall not deal with an offender by means of a suspended sentence unless it is of the opinion –

(a) that the case is one in which a sentence of imprisonment would have been appropriate even without the power to suspend the sentence; and

(b) that the exercise of that power can be justified by the exceptional circumstances of the case.”

The courts have interpreted the phrase “exceptional circumstances” strictly (R –v- Robinson 14 Cr. App. R(s) 559, A-G’s Reference (No. 5 of 993) (R –v- Hartland 15 Cr. App. R(s) 201) and there can be no doubt that the general limitation of the statutory availability of the suspended sentence, originated from public dissatisfaction with perceived over-use of the suspended sentence.

With respect, such a general limitation on section 29 of the Penal Code, would be far more useful, then the ambiguous and anomalous provisions of section 29(3)(a).

For the purposes of this appeal, I find that the purpose of the sub-section is to limit the use of suspended sentences in cases of, inter alia, offences of indecency against children, and that to that extent the suspended sentence imposed in this case, although it exceeded 6 months in length, offended that purpose.

Sentencing principles generally

Even, in the absence of section 29(3)(a) however, the sentence was wrong in principle. There are now many decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal which have allowed for the setting of a tariff for indecent assault cases. Sentences range from 1 year to 4 years, and where the victim is a child, the starting point is 3 years imprisonment. I upheld that starting point in Apisai Bavadra –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0006 of 2003S. In that case a 45 year old man rubbed his fingers over the vagina of a 9 year old child. A sentence of 2 years imprisonment was imposed and upheld. In Robin Abhinesh Lal –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0029 of 1998, Surman J upheld a sentence of 18 months imprisonment imposed for the rubbing of the victim’s vagina with the offender’s penis. The victim was 3 years old, the offender was 18.

In Mark Mutch –v- State Crim. App. No. AAU0060.1999, sentences of 4 years imprisonment each on separate counts of indecent assault which involved the fondling of breasts and the inserting of fingers into the vagina of the victims, were upheld by the Court of Appeal. As I said in Ratu Penioni Rakota –v- The State Crim. App. No. HAA0068 of 2002, aggravating factors in the indecent assault of children include the nature of the assault, whether violence was used, whether weapons were used, the length of time over which the assaults took place, the betrayal of the child’s trust in a family member or friend, and a large disparity in age between victim and offender. Mitigating factors include a plea of guilty, previous good character and remorse.

In this case, the Respondent was rightly treated as a first offender, and credit was given for the guilty plea. However, the aggravating circumstances were the assaults on the victim, the penetration of her vagina with two fingers and the age of the child compared with the age of the Respondent. With a starting point of 3 years imprisonment, reduction for the mitigation, and an increase for the aggravating factors, I arrive at a sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

The suspended sentence was therefore wrong in principle and manifestly lenient.

Conclusion

This appeal is allowed. The Respondent is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to commence today.

",1,0,1,0,1,judgment,1732
32,679,73216,"SENTENCE

Epeli Nasau Naivalu, you were charged with murder but the assessors were of the unanimous opinion that you were not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and I concurred with their opinion and convicted you accordingly.

The deceased, your wife and the mother of your 3-year-old child, was living with you and with her sister and brother in law at Links Road, Kashmir at Lautoka in May 2003.

On the 1st May 2003 about 6.30pm she went to work at the Bollywood nightclub where she was employed. Her sister went with her and although she was also employed at that nightclub, she was not working on this particular night. Your wife was to work from 7.00pm until 1.00am the next day. By arrangement, she met her sister and bouncers from the nightclub when she finished work and they were drinking beer at the seawall. Your wife and her sister returned home at about 7.00am.

You were employed as a cook at Blue Lagoon Cruises and had fed and dressed your daughter when your wife arrived home. You were dressed only in a towel and were about to have your bath to go to work. Your wife asked for and demanded money as she said she was hungry. There was food in the house, cooked by you the previous night – chicken and cassava. Your wife was drunk. She continued to demand money and you refused saying that you only had $5.00 and you needed that for your bus fare to get to work. Your wife followed you to the bathroom and after putting your daughter down, you punched her in the face. Whilst she attempted to protect herself, you punched her and she went outside, you followed and caught her and punched her, she ran away and fell over near a drain and you punched her and kicked her. When it was apparent that she was unconscious, you put water on her face, changed her clothes and took her to the Lautoka Hospital where she unable to be revived and was pronounced dead.

Your wife was an habitual drinker of alcohol and went out or stayed out drinking 2 or 3 times a week and you cared for your child, taking her to your parents when you had to go work. Your wife spent your wages and her wages on drink and at times pledged you bank card to the moneylenders for more money.

You and your wife married in 2001 and sometime later your wife left you taking the child. You followed and this resulted in you and your wife living with her sister and the sister’s husband and child.

You are 27 years of age being the oldest of 3 sisters and a brother. Your father is an Education Officer and your mother is a schoolteacher. You were brought up as a member of the Methodist Church from a young age. You have no prior convictions and you are person of previous good character.

Your counsel in the plea in mitigation asks that the court impose a suspended sentence and he submits that such a sentence is appropriate in the circumstances taking account the provocation as found by the assessors and the court, your prior record and the punishment you have and will suffer having killed the mother of your child.

The aggravating factors in the offence you committed, is the severity of the attack on your wife and the fact that you followed and even chased her outside and continued the assault. It wasn’t merely 1 or 2 blows.

The punishment for manslaughter in this country has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Kim Nam Bae v The State – AAU0015 of 1998S where the court said:

“The task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculations. This is particularly so with manslaughter where the circumstances and the offender’s culpability can vary greatly from case to case. An appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations. In order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case, the courts must have regard to sentences imposed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence.

The cases demonstrate that the penalty imposed for manslaughter ranges from a suspended sentence where there may have been grave provocation to 12 years imprisonment where the degree of violence is high and provocation is minimal. It is important to bear in mind that this range covers a very wide set of varying circumstances which attract different sentences in different manslaughter cases. Each case will attract the appropriate sentence within the range depending on its own facts.”

In Sashi Kapoor Rayan v The State – Crim App. AAU0028 of 2000S the court noted that sentences for manslaughter of a serious kind range from 7 to 10 years. State Counsel submits that the circumstances of this matter cause it to fall in the middle range and I take that to be a range of 3 to 6 years.

I have been referred to several authorities by counsel but each matter must depend on its own particular facts but the resultant sentence should be within the range the authorities set.

The incidence of domestic violence offences in this country seems disproportionately high with a high degree of acceptance of violence towards women. It is incumbent on the court to clearly show that such behaviour is not acceptable in any community in the 21st century.

I am of the opinion that an appropriate starting point in this instance is 5 years imprisonment.

Accepting as I do, that you were provoked, that you are of previous good character and that from your record you are not likely to re-offend. I give you a discount of 18 months.

You have served 3 months imprisonment whilst on remand which when adjusted for remission equates to about 5 months and I give you credit for this.

As I have said, sentencing is not a mathematical calculation and taking account of all the circumstances and the facts as referred to, I sentence you to 3 years imprisonment from today.

33,680,82905,"SENTENCE

[1] On the 16th September 2010 this accused entered a plea of guilty in the Ba Magistrates Court to one offence of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17. The particulars state that on the 23rd May 2009 at Koronubu, Ba he had unlawful carnal knowledge of (a girl) without her consent.

[2] This plea was entered after a voir dire ruling that his cautioned interview be admitted into evidence, however most oddly, the accused had entered a plea of guilty on his very first appearance on 17th June 2009, a fact that appeared to have been overlooked by both the Magistrate and the prosecution at later appearances.

[3] The facts of the case which the accused admitted in the Court below reveals that on the 23rd May 2009 at about 5.00pm, the accused who is the victim's step father called her to work in the cassava patch 150 metres from their home. In the course of the work the accused took the victim farther away from the house to a dry creek bed. Beside that creek he removed her and his own clothes and proceeded to lick her breasts, stomach and vagina. He then penetrated her and ejaculated. As a result she was infected with a sexually transmitted disease and her genitals were injured. The accused confessed to Police in an interview under caution.

[4] The victim was 13 years old at the time and a school student in Class 7. She lived in the same house with the accused, her step father. The victim had been left in the care of the accused when her mother had gone to town to shop.

[5] The accused is 40 years of age, and works as a farmer. He appeared most remorseful and asks the Court for forgiveness. He says that he succumbed to temptation. He produced in Court a letter of reference from the head of the Tavua circuit of the Methodist Church, which letter sets out his family circumstances, including the poverty faced by the family if he is removed from them, and it also states that he has commenced training as a junior lay preacher, ""having devoted his life to the Lord Jesus Christ.""

[6] The State has filed concise but relevant submissions on sentence.

[7] Rape of children in Fiji is becoming far too prevalent. It is profoundly sad that girls of school age at an extremely vulnerable stage in their development should have to suffer the crushing indignity of this offence. As Goundar J. said in State v AV HAC 192 of 2008:

""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault...Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children...sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offence.""

Psychologists tell us that the emotional damage occasioned to child victims in sexual offences is immeasurable.

[8] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment, with the tariff for rape of a child being between ten and fifteen years. If rape of a child is not serious enough, the fact that she was your step daughter adds much to the severity of the offence. As a stepfather you have a role as her protector, role model and mentor. Instead you shattered that role in a small period of which you call ""temptation"". Your relationship will never be the same again, nor could you expect it to be, nor should you deserve to be restored to a parental role in the future.

[9] For this heinous crime, I take a starting point in sentence of fifteen years. For the highly aggravating circumstances in which you infected her with a sexually transmitted disease and caused injury to her vagina, I add to that term a further 3 years. You have powerful mitigation in your favour. You pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and you are obviously remorseful. You have spent less than 2 months in custody pending sentence. For these mitigatory factors I reduce your sentence to one of 12 years and that is the sentence of the Court. You will spend 10 years in custody before you are eligible for parole.

[10] It is to be noted that the names of the accused and that of the victim have been suppressed, in order that the victim may in anonymity be allowed to recover psychologically.

[11] You have 30 days to appeal to the Fiji Court of Appeal.

• ROHIT RAJ , you were convicted after a trial to one count of Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) of the Penal Code. 
 
 
• The Prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that on 02nd August 2011 you indecently assaulted the complainant by touching her breast. 
 
 
• The maximum penalty for this offence under the Crimes Decree is 05 years imprisonment. In the Penal Code the identical offence under the section 154(1) carried similar penalty and therefore the tariff applied under the Penal Code is still valid for this offence. 
 
 
• In RT Penioni Rokota v State HAA 68/02S madam Justice Shameem held that 
 

""Sentence for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonments to 4 years. The gravity of the offence would determine the starting point for the sentence. A non custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of victim and the accused are similar and assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type""
 
  
• Considering gravity of offending I select 02 years as the starting point. 
 
 
• There are no aggravating factors and therefore I would not enhance your sentence. 
 
 
• Mitigating factors as submitted by the learned defence counsel are 31 years old, single, sole bread winner and first offender and for these I deduct 06 months to reach 18 months imprisonment. 
 
 
• Now I would consider whether to suspend this sentence as urged by the defence . You are a first offender and promised not to reoffend. Also the age of the parties are similar and this can be considered as non-penetrative assault. 
 
 
• Therefore for the purpose of reform I suspend this 18 months imprisonment to 03 years. If you commit any offences during next 03 years you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

01. Isimeli Ronavutukalou has been found guilty after trial and convicted on one count of Rape contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(a) of the Crimes Decree 2009. 

02. According to the victim on 31/08/2011 she had gone to Naisogo Village to see her daughter who was looked after there. When she got off the bus it was dark. As her house is little far from the road she started to walk. On the way she had met the accused, Emoni and two other boys and she requested from Emoni whether he could come with her up to her house. He agreed and all walked up to a bridge. At the bridge accused told Emoni that he was going to drop the victim. At that time victim wanted to relieve herself. When she was about to wear her undergarment after relieving herself the accused came there and grabbed her hand put her down on the grass and raped her. She never consented for sex with the accused at that time.

03. In this case the accused took up the position that he had sex with the victim with consent and therefore denied charge. 

04. As per section 207(1) (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009 the maximum sentence for an offence of Rape is to imprisonment for life.

Tariffs for Rape

05. In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:

""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent... the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must...reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008). The court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & others HAC 0008 of 1996, the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

06. The accused is 24 years of age and looks after his wife. He is a farmer and educated up to form 4. He is a first offender. 

07. In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person""

08. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

09. Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

10. The objectives of sentencing, as found in section 4(1) of the Decree, are as follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;

	2.	To protect the community from offenders;

	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;

	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or 

	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

11. Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;

(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;

(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;

(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

12. Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The accused is a relation of the victim.

	2.	The accused under the guise of providing protection on her way home raped the victim.

3. The accused showed total disregard to the victim's right to a peaceful life by committing this offence.

13. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

(a) Accused is 24 years and a young offender. 

(b) He is married and looks after his young wife.

(c) He is a first offender.

(e) He is remorseful.

(f) He does community service and helps elders and other needy people.

14. Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I sentence you as follows:

I take 07 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add 03 years for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 10 years. I deduct 02 years for the mitigating factors.

15. In summary you are sentenced to 08 years imprisonment.

16. Acting in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 06 years as non-parole period. 

17. 30 days to appeal.

36,683,270400,"SENTENCE
 
  
• In a judgment delivered yesterday, the court found you guilty of ""burglary"" [count no. 1], ""rape"" [count no. 2 and 3] and ""sexual assault"" [count no. 4]. You were convicted accordingly on those counts.
 
 
• The brief facts were as follows. On 31 May 2013, you were 40 years old, the female complainant was 49 years old, and her husband was 55 years old. You were a close friend of the complainant's husband, and often visited their home to drink grog with him. On 31 May 2013, between 9pm and 10pm, you invaded the complainant's house, went into her bedroom while wearing a mask and brandishing a cane knife, forcefully tied her up, and later raped her twice. You also sexually assaulted her by kissing her breasts. After committing the offences, you fled the crime scene.
 
 
• I will start with the offence of ""rape"", as it was the most serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, although the tariff set by previous case laws was a sentence between 7 to 15 years imprisonment. ""Burglary"" carries a maximum sentence of 13 years imprisonment, although previous case laws had set the tariff a sentence between 18 months to 3 years imprisonment. ""Sexual assault"" carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Previous case laws had often set the tariff between 1 to 4 years imprisonment. Of course, the final sentence will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.
 
 
• In this case, the aggravating factors, were as follows:
  
• (i) Breach of Trust: The complainant's husband was a close friend of yours. He treated you like a son. You often went to his house to drink grog. In fact, the complainant's family treated you as a family friend, and opened their house to you. Unbeknown to them, you were really nothing but a conniving con artist. When your friend's wife was left alone, at the material time, you raided their house, held a knife against her, sexually assaulted and raped her. You certainly breached the trust they had in you;
 
 
• (ii) Use of Extreme Violence: You used a cane knife to threaten and subdue the helpless and vulnerable complainant at the material time. Then you proceeded to tie her hands and legs with pieces of cloth and tapes. Then you blindfolded her and taped the cloth on her face, and also taped her mouth. You completely subdued her when offending against her. This was obviously a frightening experience for the complainant.
 
 
• (iii) After committing the crimes against the complainant, you returned to their house, and pretend to sympathize with them, and drank grog with them until the morning. This was the height of all evil and blatant deceit.
 

 
• The mitigating factors were as follows:
  
• (i) At the age of 41 years old, this was your first offending;
 
 
• (ii) You have been remanded in custody for the previous 1 year 8 months.
 

 
• I will start with the ""rape"" offences, as they are the most serious of the offences. On count no. 2 [rape], I start with a sentence of 15 years imprisonment. I add 4 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 19 years imprisonment. I deduct 1 year 8 months for the time spent in remand, leaving a balance of 17 years 4 months. I deduct a further 1 year 4 months for being a first offender, leaving a balance of 16 years imprisonment.
 
 
• I repeat the above process and sentence for count no. 3 [rape].
 
 
• On the ""burglary"" charge [count no. 1], I start with 1 ½ years imprisonment. I add 2 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 3 ½ years imprisonment. I deduct 1 ½ years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 2 years imprisonment.
 
 
• On the ""sexual assault"" charge [count no. 4], I start with a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. I add 1 year for the aggravating factors, making a total of 3 years imprisonment. I deduct 1 year for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 2 years imprisonment.
 
 
• In summary, your sentences are as follows:
  
• (i) Count no. 1 : Burglary : 2 years imprisonment
 
• (ii) Count no. 2 : Rape : 16 years imprisonment
 
• (iii) Count no. 3 : Rape : 16 years imprisonment
 
• (iv) Count no. 4 : Sexual assault : 2 years imprisonment
 

 
• Because of the totality principle of sentencing, I direct that all the above sentences are made concurrent to each other, thus making a final sentence of 16 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Mubarak Hussain, for burgling, sexually assaulting and raping the complainant on 31 May 2013, at Nausori in the Central Division, I sentence you to 16 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 years, effective forthwith.
 
 
• The name of the complainant is permanently suppressed to protect her privacy.

	1.	The Accused was found guilty and convicted for the offence of rape after full trial, DPP v Veresa [2012] FJMC 167; Criminal Case 1560.2007(17July 2012). 

	2.	The Charge read as follows;
	3.	
CHARGE:

Statement of Offence [a]

RAPE: Contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code Act 17.

Particulars of Offence [b]

LEONE KOTOBALAVU VERESA, on the 8th day of December, 2007 at Nasinu in the Central Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of Kelera Veresa without her consent.

	1.	The Accused and the virtual Complainant are related as biological brother and sister. The day in question, that afternoon, the victim was called by the accused to his home. The accused was acquainted by their parents regarding some lesbian behavior and stealing of money. He then questioned the victim regarding homo sexual relationship (Lesbian) with a lady and stealing of $600 money which she denied. The accused was having party gathering and fully drunk at the moment. The victim was then assaulted and questioned. While in this process, the victim urinated and passed feces because of fear and assaults. She was 22 years at that time. Then, on request of the accused’s wife, the victim had a bath and cleaned herself and then, she was taken into a room for counseling instead the accused ravished and raped her.

	2.	Section 150 of the Penal Code provides the punishment.

Punishment of rape

“150. Any person who commits the offence of rape is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without corporal punishment”

	1.	Tariff for the offence of this nature (incestuous rape) is discussed in many cases including Drotini v State Cr. App. AAU001/05, State v Tamanitokula (2010) FJHC 373. HAC 028/2010 (2 September 2010) and The State v Navaunioni Koroi (Unreported) Cri App Case No HAA 050.2002S. It is between 10 years to 20 years. In Navauniami Koroi (HAA 0050.2002), Shameem J. found that it was a serious aggravating factor that the rape victim was the convict's daughter and added four years to the sentence to reflect that and again Shameem J. In Poese (HAA0091J.2004S) in dealing with an accused convicted of raping his 17 year old daughter, and similarly to this case showing a dagger at the time) , found that a term of 15 years imprisonment was appropriate. 

	2.	But this court cannot exceed its maximum sentencing range 10 years. I commence your sentence at 10 years imprisonment.

	3.	Both parties have filed closing submissions and mitigating submissions. The Court has called the Victim Impact report and Antecedent Report. I am mindful of those documents. 

	4.	Aggravating Factors:
		(a) The virtual Complainant is your sister;

		(b) You betrayed the trust of brother and sister;

		(c) The victim was severely assaulted;

Considering the above aggravating factors I increase your sentence by 2 years now your sentence is 12 years imprisonment.

	1.	Mitigating Circumstances:
		(a) You are 1st offender and ex Special Police Inspector;
		(b) You are 33 years old;
		(c) Married with four children( Age 10, 8, 6 and 2 years);
		(d) Baby sitter of 4 children
		(e) Care giver of the wife’s 64 years old grandmother.
		(f) Matter is hung over 5 years over his head.
		(g) You suffered humiliation and mental agony.
		(h) You are totally remorseful of your actions;
		(i) You seek suspended sentence.

Considering above mitigating factors I reduce your sentence by 4 years. Now your actual sentence is 08 years imprisonment.

10 It is to be noted that this is an incestuous rape. The circumstance offending is ironic. The accused was overjoyed by his “Sukuna bowl” winning for the first time. He started drinking that Friday after winning with his mates and continued to drink almost 24 hours till this incident happened. He drank several brands of alcohols such as Whiskey, Rum, Gin, Beer and home brewed. His mind was anomalous. It seems that the act was done by his alcohol, if he was in normal sense he would not have done this act. It is seen that act was done to get rid of homo sexual behavior of the victim (According to the accused) and get affection to men and natural behavior of sex. It should be noted that there is no single injury in genital areas and the victim was tuned up and ravished before the act. This act was to get affection for natural behavior of sex. This act was suggested to him by his alcoholic mind. Thus, superficially this is a grave, cynical crime but attended alcoholic circumstance says that is was not done for lust but to chasten the victim from homo sexual behavior. This was a random act and it was not premeditated. 

11 The accused sought court leniency and forgiveness. He stressed that he be given a suspended sentence. I have already concluded 8 years imprisonment and under section 26(2) a sentence over two year cannot be wholly suspended by a Magistrate. I consider law in depth for this matter. 
12 In Sec 15(3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree clearly says that court has to consider all other options and the prison sentence should be the last resort. This is the main of object of sentencing. I reproduce it for clarity; 
As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part (Emphasis is mine).

13 Superior Courts have reiterated this objective for fist offenders. In Prasad v State [1994] FJCA 19; Aau0023u.93s (24 May 1994), Fiji Court of Appeal held that "".... Courts ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence for first offenders."" It has been noted in Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132 that criminologists recognise that a prison sentence should be the last resort especially where a first offender is concerned unless the charge is very serious or the offender is dangerous and imprisonment is called for in the public interest or in the interest of the offender himself. (Emphasize is mine). 

14 In sentencing, I draw my attention to sentencing principles which set out in Sentencing and Penalty Decree 2009.

Section 4(2) provides;”In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to; 

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender’s culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender’s previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option.” 

15 What are the options available for the court? The sec 15 (1) set down the range of the sentences court can impose .They are as follows;

(a) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment; 

(b) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment partly in custody and partly in the community; 

(c) record a conviction and make a drug treatment order in accordance with regulations made under section 30;

(d) record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment that is wholly or partly suspended; 

(e) with or without recording a conviction, make an order for community work to be undertaken in accordance with the Community Work Act 1994 or for a probation order under the Probation of Offenders Act [Cap. 22]; 

(f) with or without recording a conviction, order the offender to pay a fine;

(g) record a conviction and order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court;

(h) record a conviction and order the discharge of the offender;

(i) without recording a conviction, order the release of the offender on the adjournment of the hearing, and subject to the offender complying with certain conditions determined by the court; 

(j) without recording a conviction, order the dismissal of the charge; or

(k) impose any other sentence or make any other order that is authorized under this Decree or any other Act.

16 Section 26(1) the said Decree says;

""On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.""

17. In ""Divendra Bija vs State"" 43 FLR 144, it was held ""each case must be assessed and evaluated in its true merits and that the best guidance as always is for the courts to grasp the essence of established general principles of sentencing and apply them based on the fundamental premise that a sentence should not be harsh and excessive or wrong in principle"". (Emphasis is mine) 

17 Partly suspension of a sentence is therefore satisfied by this court and appropriate with relate to offence. When contemplating, it is a sad and unfortunate incident occurred but the offence was done by the accused. But he was so foolish and no proper judgment could be taken at that time due to his anomalous mind. Normally, incestuous rapes are done by perpetrators for long period of time on victims and many times but in this occasion it was a single act of rape. I therefore decide to give partial suspended sentence. 

18 You, LEONE KOTOBALAVU VERESA, are sentenced to 08 years imprisonment and your sentence will run on every weekends. That means you attend/admit every Friday 7pm to Sunday 7pm to the correction centre to serve your sentence. Your sentence is partially suspended on rest of weekdays. That means you will be released from prison on every Sunday 7pm to Friday 7pm. This sentence is with effect from today. By this sentence you will serve 104 days (52 weeks X 2) in custody per year. I do not set any non parole period. You are abide by the Prison Rules and Regulations. The court hopes this sentence will proportionate the crime and ease your family business. But you are severely warned not to re offend and you are placed on non contact order and non molestation order under Domestic Violence Decree 2009 considering victim's impact report. 

19 If you want to appeal, you may appeal within 28 days to the High Court of Fiji. A copy of the sentence is given to the both parties for this purpose.

38,685,82417,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1] In November of 2001 the present applicant was charged in the Magistrate’s Court at Suva on a charge that he had carnal knowledge of a girl without her consent.

[2] After various adjournments counsel for the Applicant Mr Fa accepted that there was a prima facie case for the charge to be referred to the High Court for trial, and he consented to committal without consideration of the evidence. The prosecution agreed and the proceedings were accordingly referred to the High Court.

[3] In June 2003 at 11 am on that date the Judge was advised by Mr Fa that there was a possibility of a plea of guilty and the proceedings were stood over to the following Monday when in the absence of a plea of guilty the trial was to proceed.

[4] On Monday the 30 June the information was read to the applicant who stated that he understood the charge and entered a plea of guilty.

[5] Mr Fa entered a plea in mitigation on behalf of the accused and he was sentenced at 11 am on that morning.

[6] The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven years.

[7] On the 23 September the applicant acting on his own behalf without the benefit of counsel applied for leave to appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal against both conviction and sentence. The application was heard by a single Judge of this Court who considered that the seriousness of the charge and the sentence imposed justified the granting of leave and granted leave accordingly. The Judge further recommended that legal aid be granted to the applicant.

[8] The appeal came before the Court of Appeal on the 16 March 2005. The applicant appeared on his own behalf and the judgment shows that at the hearing the applicant abandoned his appeal against conviction, proceeding only with an appeal against sentence.

[9] The Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of seven years imprisonment.

[10] The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against both conviction and sentence.

Grounds of Appeal
[11] (i) That the learned High Court Judge erred in Law and in fact in accepting the uncorroborated evidence of the Complainant.

(ii) That the learned trial Judge erred in Law and in fact in admitting the medical report as evidence of the fact that the Complainant was raped.

(iii) That the learned trial judge erred in Law and in fact in failing to give reasons for either believing or disbelieving the material witness.

(iv) That the learned trial judge misdirected herself as to the onus of proof that lay on the prosecution.

(v) That the verdict is unsafe, dangerous and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence as a whole.

(vi) That the sentence is harsh and excessive having regards to all the circumstances of the case.

Decision

[12] The first five grounds of appeal all related to the evidence against the appellant. The applicant complains that the evidence of the complainant was uncorroborated and that certain medical evidence ought not to have been admitted. He contends that the Judge ought to have given reasons for either believing or disbelieving the material witness (presumably the complainant) that she misdirected herself as to the onus of proof and that the verdict was unsafe and could not be supported.

[13] The problem for the Applicant is that he entered a plea of guilty so that the matters of which he complained were not before the Judge and not pronounced on by her.

[14] It appears that the applicant now contends that he was persuaded by counsel, against his will to enter the plea of guilty.

[15] Unfortunately he abandoned his appeal against conviction in the Court of Appeal so that none of the matters of which he now complains were considered in that Court. The abandonment of the appeal against conviction in the Court of Appeal results in there being no decision of that Court which is appealable.

[16] We cannot certify that the appeal against sentence in this case gave rise to a question of significant public importance or that there were grounds for giving leave to appeal.

[17] The application is accordingly declined.

39,686,80598,"SENTENCE

	1.	In a judgment delivered by the court yesterday, the accused was found guilty of raping a 14 year old female complainant, by inserting his finger into her vagina, without her consent, contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(b) of the Crimes Decree 2009. He was convicted accordingly.

	2.	The facts were briefly as follows. The complainant, while walking near a beach in Natauloa Village, Nairai, on 24th January, 2011, was suddenly grabbed by the accused, who was 49 years old, at the time. He then forcefully took off her sulu, her shorts and panty, and forced her to lie on the ground. He then knelt beside her, and inserted his finger into her vagina, without her consent. At the time, he knew the complainant was not consenting to the above. Matter was later reported to police, and the accused was charged with rape.

3. As I have said in State v Poate Rainima, Criminal Case No. HAC 034 of 2011S, High Court, Suva, ""Rape"" is always a serious offence. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. It is the worst form of sexual assault on an individual. It is an unwanted invasion of a person's body without that person's consent. Consequently, the courts take a dim view of it, and have set a tariff of 7 to 15 years imprisonment. The worse form of rape is reserved for the higher end of the tariff. See Mohammed Kasim v The State, Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 1993, Fiji Court of Appeal; Bera Yalimaiwai v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0033 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal; Navuniani Koroi v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0037 of 2002, Fiji Court of Appeal and Viliame Tamani v The State, Criminal Appeal No. AAU 0025 of 2003, Fiji Court of Appeal.

4. The mitigating factors in this case were as follows:

(i) At the age of 51 years old, this is your first offence;

(ii) You are married with five children aged between 5 to 21 years old;

(iii) You are a subsistence farmer at Natauloa Village, Nairai, and you are the sole bread winner;

(iv) You have been remanded in custody, in this case, for approximately 6 months.

	1.	The aggravating factors were as follows:
		(i) The complainant was 14 years old, at the time, and you were 49 years old. There was a 35 years age gap between the two of you, and one could say that, because you both resided in Natauloa Village Nairai, you stood in a position of an elder in the village, and consequently, in a position of trust. As an elder, you were supposed to look after and care for the village children. The complainant was old enough to be your child. Yet you exploited the trust she previously held for you, and unlawfully inserted your finger into her vagina. This was a serious breach of trust by a village elder. And for this breach of trust, you will have to accept that your liberty will have to be forfeited;

		(ii) During the hearing, you unnecessarily defamed the character of this complainant, by saying she was watching blue movies, and she wanted you to perform some moves on her. In my view, these were outright lies by you, and they were totally unnecessary. In my view, the above were your own wild imagination.

	2.	I start with a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. For the aggravating factors, I increase the sentence by 3 years to 10 years imprisonment. I deduct the 10 years by 2 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 8 years imprisonment.

	3.	In summary, I sentence you to 8 years imprisonment and you are to serve a non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment, effective forthwith.

",1,0,1,0,1,sentence,642
40,687,79741,"JUDGMENT

Chief Justice Anthony Gates:

[1] The Petitioner’s amended petition of appeal was filed on 28th July 2014. This raises two grounds of appeal, one concerning a failure to direct on recent complaint evidence and one against excessive sentence. The original signed petition which was hand written had been filed within time on 31st March 2014. The Court of Appeal’s decision which is now challenged had been delivered on 5th March 2014.

[2] All of the grounds raised in the original petition, when the Petitioner was not represented, according to Mr. Sharma, counsel for the petitioner, are now abandoned in favour of the two new grounds.

[3] On 7th June 2010 the Petitioner was convicted before the Suva High Court of 4 counts of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code and one count of indecent assault contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code. All of the counts in the information were said to be representative of the total wrongdoing. The three assessors tendered unanimous opinions that the Petitioner was guilty on all 5 counts. The judge accepted those opinions and convicted the Petitioner on all 5 counts.

[4] On 10th June 2010 the Petitioner was sentenced to terms of 16 years imprisonment concurrent on the rape charges with a minimum non-parole period fixed of 12 years. He was sentenced to a concurrent term of 3 years imprisonment on the indecent assault charge.

The Evidence in the High Court
[5] The victim, a female child, was aged 10 years when her 37 year old de facto step-father, the Petitioner, first committed an act of rape upon her. The unlawful conduct was said to have been going on for a little more than a year, between January 2008 – January 2009 at the Petitioner’s home in Muanikoso. The Petitioner denied any form of sexual contact with the victim. However at trial he chose to remain silent. In doing so he exercised a right which was properly open to him without attracting adverse inference, and this the learned judge made clear to the assessors.

[6] The victim’s mother had to go out to work at times when the Petitioner was at home alone with the victim.

[7] In the Court of Appeal judgment the nub of the case was summarised [at para [4]:

“The complainant said in her evidence that he would touch her all over the body and in Court using a body chart she pointed to genitals saying that he would insert his penis into her vagina and then threaten her that if she told anyone he would kill her. Once when she wanted to tell her mother he hit her on the mouth causing her to bleed. Her mother asked her what had happened and she said nothing because the accused was present watching and she was scared. She told of repeated acts of rape in 2008 and 2009 and said she didn’t like it and didn’t want him to do it. She eventually told her cousin in Navua who told her own mother and the offences were thus revealed.”

[8] In her evidence the complainant gave explicit evidence of penile penetration by the Petitioner. She also referred to the threats to kill her if she told anyone. It used to happen when the Petitioner did not go to work. She did not tell her mother about it but instead eventually told her cousin sister who lived in Navua. She did not tell her mother she said because “my stepfather beat me up” [Record p180]. She was hit on the mouth and was injured. He threatened to beat her up “if she told her mother.”

[9] She mentioned the occasion when the Petitioner had been sitting outside with two neighbours. He had then come into her bedroom and touched her breasts. She pushed him away. This was seen by the two men she said, one of whom came to give evidence which supported what she had said had happened to her in full view of those two. Her mother was in the bathroom whilst this was going on. This was the incident that formed the indecent assault charge.

[10] She said she had told her grandmother and cousin sister about this incident. The cousin was told a few days later in Navua when she went on a visit. She did not tell them of the insertions, only of the touching, and that the Petitioner had said he wanted “to make a baby like my sister’s daughter.” She said she did not tell the full story because she was scared.

[11] She went with the grandmother after this conversation and they visited the Social Welfare. She was not taken to the police then, only after she had been injured by the Petitioner. In court the complainant moved out from behind the screen and identified the Petitioner as the perpetrator.

[12] The complainant said it was the first time she had experienced such a thing.

[13] In cross-examination, she said she had not told one of her sisters who was living with her because “I was scared that if I tell her she will reveal everything to mom and she will get beaten by the Accused.” She conceded she never liked the Accused, who was very strict with her, telling her she must go to school.

[14] One of the cousin sisters was younger than the complainant. She was 8 years old when she gave evidence. She said the complainant told her the Petitioner was touching her body and her breasts, “and if I want I can tell my mother about it.” She did, and her mother was the next witness.

[15] The mother spoke to the complainant. She said the complainant was crying and afraid. But she repeated the allegation against the Petitioner. This information was passed on to the grandmother, who next gave evidence of the complaint and of taking the granddaughter to the Social Welfare.

[16] The 5th prosecution witness Prani Pradeep Singh was the next door neighbour. He was married with a 3 year old child. He said he had seen the Petitioner touching the complainant’s private parts and breasts. They had been drinking beer with the Petitioner. He had been helping the Petitioner the whole day repairing a vehicle. This witness and a man called Danny were in the porch and could see inside the house to the bedroom.

[17] The complainant was lying on the bed. Prani saw the Petitioner put his hands underneath the dress of the complainant. He saw him touching her private parts and her breasts. The girl’s reaction he said was “very scared and helpless.” He saw her trying to push him away. The Petitioner was in the room for approximately 7 minutes. He confronted the Petitioner when he returned to the porch. The Petitioner said he was just cuddling the girl “so I told him that I saw what he was doing to the girl. He didn’t speak further. That was the last beer we had. I went home.” [Record p202].

[18] He conceded in cross-examination that he witnessed the incident whilst “standing and leaning against the car” not from the sitting room. The last part of the cross-examination went as follows [Record p205]:

“Q: I put it to you, you do this because you have a grudge against Anand for confronting you on the battery?
A: No why I am doing this today because I have a 3 year old daughter too.

Q: Even though you have a 3 year old daughter in 2009 June you didn’t report to Police?
A: I thought it would be suitable for my wife to talk to Anand’s wife about this.”

[19] The witness was not shaken in cross-examination.

[20] Dr. Reapi Mataika, a Paediatric Registrar, had a Diploma in Child Health and was studying for her Masters in Child Medicine. The complainant was taken to the doctor by her grandmother. In her report the doctor observed and noted that the child was “quite distressed when asked to recount incidents, crying.” The medical report was read out in the course of the witness’ evidence and exhibited. Upon her examination the doctor noted that there was no evidence of an hymen. She explained that the hymen could be lost through sexual intercourse or if there were a blood trauma. Sometimes physical activity such as horse riding could also cause the loss.

[21] The doctor was of the opinion that the loss as described by the complainant was consistent with what was found upon examination. The Petitioner’s behaviour towards the child was sufficient to cause the loss.

[22] The doctor said the history and examination were undertaken when the complainant was alone with her. The grandmother was asked to be outside, which is the normal procedure in such cases.

[23] The Petitioner was interviewed by the police and these allegations put to him. He denied them completely, as also in his charge statement.

[24] As I have said earlier, the Petitioner declined to give evidence himself. He called no witnesses.

The Court of Appeal and the Raising of a Fresh Ground
[25] Apart from one ground, the alleged severity of the sentence, the appeal to the Court of Appeal against conviction was made on grounds not carried forward to this court. The appeal against conviction is now made on an entirely fresh ground, which I set out below:

Ground One
The Learned Appellate Judges of Appeal erred in law and in fact when they failed to realize that the summing up of the Learned Trial Judge lacks directions to the assessors on the use of recent complaint evidence to assess the credibility of the complainant resulting in substantial miscarriage of justice.

[26] It must be remembered that when the decision of the Court of Appeal is not itself impugned, but that an entirely fresh ground is sought to be argued in the Apex Court, the task of the Petitioner in achieving the grant of special leave is that much more arduous.

[27] In Dip Chand v The State CAV0014/2012, 9th May 2012 this Court [at paragraph 34] held that:

“Given that the criteria set out in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act No. 14 of 1998 are extremely stringent, and special leave to appeal is not granted as a matter of course, the fact that the majority of the grounds relied upon by the petitioner for special leave to appeal have not been raised in the Court of Appeal makes the task of the petitioner of crossing the threshold requirements for special leave even more difficult.”

[28] The Court continued at paragraph 36:

“The Supreme Court has been even more stringent in considering the applications for special leave to appeal on the basis of grounds of appeal not taken up or argued in the Court of Appeal. In Josateki Solinakoroi –v- The State Criminal Appeal No. CAV 0005 of 2005 the Supreme Court of Fiji in an exceptional case took into consideration the principles developed by (the) Privy Council in similar situations and in particular relied on the following observation in Kwaku Mensah –v- The King (1946) AC 83:

“Where a substantial and grave injustice might otherwise occur the Privy Council would allow a new point to be taken which had not been raised below even when it was not raised in the petitioner’s printed case.”

[29] The same line was taken in Akuila Dromudole v. The State CAV0013/2013, 19th August 2014, a decision delivered in these very same sittings. In Charles v. The State [2000] 1 WLR 384 the Board observed that matters should be raised first with the trial judge [which it was] and then with the Court of Appeal [which it was not]. The matters there involved delay, re-trial and abuse of process. Lord Slynn of Hadley at page 387H said:

“Their Lordships would generally be reluctant to allow the issue to be raised for the first time before them. Here, the issue was raised squarely before the judge even though it was not raised before the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances their Lordships accept that since the matter was raised before the trial judge the defendants are entitled to raise the issue before them on this appeal.”

[30] In the instant case, counsel for the Petitioner was asked by the trial judge whether he sought any re-directions at the end of the summing up. Counsel agreed with prosecuting counsel there was nothing else to direct on [Record p208]. This omission is in itself usually sufficient to disregard a ground such as is raised here: Segran Murti v. The State Crim. App. No. CAV0016/2008S 12th February 2009 paragraphs 11, 15, 21-23; Truong v. The Queen [2004] HCA 10; 2004 ALJR 473.

[31] The position might have been different if the charge laid was incapable of being proved, such as where evidence led had been given at a Royal Commission which evidence had by statute been specifically made inadmissible in criminal proceedings: Gianarelli v. The Queen [1983] HCA 41; (1983) 154 CLR 212. Such a set of circumstances was truly exceptional, and this is the threshold to be applied.

Evidence of Recent Complaint
[32] Fiji courts are no longer concerned with corroboration of a complainant’s evidence in a trial for an offence of a sexual nature. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 governed the evidentiary conduct of the trial, though the events related pre-dated the imposition of that section. It read:

S.129 “Where any person is tried for an offence of a sexual nature, no corroboration of the complainant’s evidence shall be necessary for that person to be convicted; and in any such case the judge or magistrate shall not be required to give any warning to the assessors relating to the absence of corroboration.”

[33] In any case evidence of recent complaint was never capable of corroborating the complainant’s account: R v. Whitehead (1929) 1 KB 99. At most it was relevant to the question of consistency, or inconsistency, in the complainant’s conduct, and as such was a matter going to her credibility and reliability as a witness: Basant Singh & Others v. The State Crim. App. 12 of 1989; Jones v. The Queen [1997] HCA 12; (1997) 191 CLR 439; Vasu v. The State Crim. App. AAU0011/2006S, 24th November 2006.

[34] At trial, defence counsel could have raised with the judge the proper direction to the assessors. In Abdul Khair Mohammd Islam [1997] 1 Cr. App. R. 22 Buxton LJ said:

“We are told that before speeches, and very usefully and properly, in accordance with the practice repeatedly urged by this Court, counsel discussed with the judge any particular directions that he should give to the jury. It was apparently agreed that he should remind the jury of the particular, and limited, nature and effect of the complaint evidence. In the event, however, no such direction was given. At the end of the summing-up neither counsel reminded the judge of that omission.”

[35] The raising of direction matters in this way is a useful trial function and in following it, counsel assist in achieving a fair trial. In doing so they act in their client’s interest. The appellate courts will not look favourably on cases where counsel have held their seats, hoping for an appeal point, when issues in directions should have been raised with the judge. We do not believe this was intended in this case.

[36] In the case before us the judge referred in his directions to the complaints to the other witnesses in these terms [Record p41]:

“The prosecution case rests substantially on the evidence of the victim Shayal. Prosecution says that her evidence is reliable, that it is strengthened by her informing it to the cousin sister, grandmother and the Doctor.”

[37] Procedurally for the evidence of recent complaint to be admissible, both the complainant and the witness complained to, must testify as to the terms of the complaint: Kory White v. The Queen [1999] 1 AC 210 at p215H. This was done here.

[38] The complaint is not evidence of facts complained of, nor is it corroboration. It goes to the consistency of the conduct of the complainant with her evidence given at the trial. It goes to support and enhance the credibility of the complainant.

[39] The complaint need not disclose all of the ingredients of the offence. But it must disclose evidence of material and relevant unlawful sexual conduct on the part of the Accused. It is not necessary for the complainant to describe the full extent of the unlawful sexual conduct, provided it is capable of supporting the credibility of the complainant’s evidence. The judge should point out inconsistencies. These he referred to in an earlier paragraph.

[40] The Petitioner’s argument is that the complainant did not go so far as to complain to the witnesses about rape. The cousin sister said the complainant told her that the Petitioner was touching her body and breasts. The same story was related by the aunt, the mother of the cousin sister, and by the grandmother.

[41] However when alone with the doctor, the complainant told a fuller story. She recorded the complainant as saying “Her stepdad Anand usually touches her breasts and at times would remove her panties and insert his fingers into her. He also sucks her breasts and twice he put his ‘susu’ into her ‘susu’.”

[42] In The State v. Waisea Volavola Cr. App. HAA 106/2002S in dealing with recent complaint and the issue of the complaint being “recent” Shameem J said at p13:

“However, her silence could easily have been consistent with her shame at the incident, connected with cultural taboos in relation to discussing sexual matters with elders. To say that an absence of recent complaint confirms consent is an error of both fact and law. On the facts of this case, there was nothing to suggest that her silence meant consent to the sexual intercourse.”

[43] This might explain the lack of explicit forthrightness by the complainant on the extent of the molestation when speaking to her relatives, as against the opportunity to put the story to the doctor when she was not overshadowed by those taboos. Certainly it was open to regard the report to the doctor as a recent complaint in view of the fear with which she was observed preventing her from telling the full story, and the fear of which she testified. Strict dicta to the contrary in Peniasi Senikarawa v. The State Crim. App. AAU0005/2004S 24th March 2006 may have been setting too inflexible a rule. A complainant’s explanation as to why a report was not made immediately, or in its fullest detail, is to be expected. The real question is whether the witness was consistent and credible in her conduct and in her explanation of it.

[44] There were of course several difficulties with the recent complaint evidence in Senikarawa. The mother’s evidence did not tally well with that of the complainant daughter. But one must bear in mind as was said in Spooner v. R [2004] EWCA Crim. 1320 Eng. Court of Appeal it is not necessary for the complainant to describe “the full extent of the unlawful sexual conduct.” It is enough here, besides the evidence of touching the body all over, the touching the breasts, touching of private parts, and the inserting of fingers into the vagina. Molested traumatised children are not to be expected to provide answers with confident all-encompassing and anatomical precision as if to a Board of Examining Surgeons.

[45] In White supra at p220C, the Privy Council held that since the case turned entirely upon the complainant’s credibility, it was not possible to apply the proviso and the appeal had to be allowed and the conviction set aside. In that case the persons to whom she complained were not called to give evidence, and so there was no supportive evidence of her consistency and credibility.

[46] In the instant case, the judge’s recounting of the prosecutor’s closing arguments may have been infelicitous. It was after all the credibility and consistency of the complainant that was supported, if accepted, by the evidence of recent complaints, not the complainant’s ‘evidence’ that was strengthened. The distinction in the purpose of the evidence has been done away with in England by the passing of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which makes the previous statements admissible if certain conditions are met [s.120 (4) (7) and (8)].

[47] Here though there were repeated complaints, they did at least provide evidence of the complainant’s consistent conduct: R v. O [2006] 2 Cr. App. R. 27.

[48] The judge went on to refer to the other evidence which provided supportive evidence of the complaint. First there was the doctor’s evidence. There was no other suggestion as to how the hymen was missing. Of course the doctor’s evidence did not link the Petitioner in the crime. That identity was provided by the complainant whom the assessors and judge upon their observations at trial were to decide whether she had been truthful and credible in making such accusations.

[49] The other powerful evidence was that of the neighbour who saw the molestation in the bedroom from the porch. That was direct evidence, supporting the complainant’s evidence, contradicting the defence case of total denial of any impropriety and tending to confirm the complainant was a witness of truth. This was clearly cogent and convincing evidence. There was no such independent evidence in White.

[50] The inadequacy of the direction would not therefore have affected the result.

[51] Special leave is not to be granted on an issue not raised in the two lower courts, for no exceptional grounds have been raised. If such had been found, the proviso would have been applied since there was available other convincing evidence of guilt disregarding the credibility evidence of recent complaints. A substantial and grave injustice will not occur from a refusal of special leave on this ground and on the appeal against conviction [section 7 (2) (c) Supreme Court Act]. The threshold requirements for leave have not been reached.

Against Sentence
[52] The Petitioner through his counsel files a single ground of appeal against sentence stating that the learned trial judge “erred in principle and also erred in exercising his sentencing discretion to the extent –

(a) That he took a high starting point of 12 years imprisonment.
(b) Adding 7 years as aggravating factors to the already high starting point.”
[53] As has been said often by this court, the challenge in the Supreme Court must be to the error of the court below in its judgment, that is of the Court of Appeal, not that of the High Court. The appeal by petition is brought by virtue of this court’s jurisdiction [section 98 (3) Constitution of 2013].

[54] Counsel referred us to Simeli Bili Naisua v. The State Crim. App. No. CAV 0010 of 2003. At paragraphs 19, 20 Goundar JA in the Supreme Court set out the correct approach to sentencing appeals. It is worth repeating those clear directions:

“[19] It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentencing using the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v The State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0015 at [2]. Appellate courts will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:

(i) Acted upon a wrong principle;
(ii) Allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
(iii) Mistook the facts;
(iv) Failed to take into account some relevant consideration.
[20] When considering the grounds of appeal against sentence, the above principles serve as an important yardstick to arrive at a conclusion whether the ground is arguable. This point is well supported by a decision on leave to appeal against sentence in Chirk King Yam v The State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0095 of 2011 at [18]-[9]. In the present case, the learned judge’s conclusion that the appellant had not shown his sentence was wrong in law was made in error. The test for leave is not whether the sentence is wrong in law. The test is whether the grounds of appeal against sentence are arguable points under the four principles of Kim Bam Bae’s case.”

[55] I therefore asked the Petitioner’s counsel under which of these permissible appellate headings he sought to bring this sentencing appeal. He indicated it was on (i) that is that the judge acted upon a wrong principle. However as was clear during the course of counsel’s argument, and in the written submissions, the complaint dealt with quantum of sentence rather than principle. Indeed the nature of the principle offended was not identified. Quantum can rarely be a ground for the intervention of the Supreme Court.

[56] In the High Court the Accused was sentenced as follows:

Count 1. [Rape] 16 years imprisonment
2. [Rape] “
3. [Rape] “
4. [Rape] “
5. [Indecent Assault] 3 years imprisonment

All sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. The total sentence therefore was 16 years. The judge ordered a non-parole period or minimum term to be served of 12 years imprisonment.

[57] The learned judge referred to State v. AV [2009] FJHC 24; HAC 192.2008, 21st February 2009 where it had been said:

“Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault .... Society cannot condone any form of sexual assaults on children ... Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.”

[58] The judge correctly identified the tariff for rape of a child as being between 10-14 years imprisonment (Mutch v. State Cr. App. AAU 0060/99, Mani v. State Cr. App. No. HAA 0053/021, State v. Saitava Cr. Case No. HAC 10/07, State v. Tony Cr. App. No. HAA 003/08).

[59] His Lordship took his starting point as 12 years and added 7 years for the aggravating factors. No criticism can be made of the starting point selected. It was within the tariff.

[60] A reduction of 2 years was allowed for the Petitioner’s mitigating factors. The mitigation was identified as that he was 40 years old with a 5 year old son from a previous marriage and that he was looking after a 53 year old mother. In addition it was acknowledged that his business and properties had been taken over by his brother, “and that he was remorseful.” In the circumstances, the allowance of 2 years was over-generous as was noted by the Court of Appeal. His responsibility for his 5 year old son and 53 year old mother was in reality of little mitigatory value.

[61] However the suggestion that he was remorseful could count for nothing. He had pleaded not guilty, which was his right. But in doing so, he had put the complainant through the misery, fear, and embarrassment of having to give evidence and be cross-examined. Then he gave no evidence. Such a combination has been considered to amount to no mitigation at all: Asesela Drotini v. The State Crim. App. AAU0001/2005S 24th March 2006. She gave evidence in court from behind a screen. Indeed in his appeal, and by his appeal against conviction, he has maintained his innocence. No value can be attached to such remorse.

[62] The high level of the sentence had its origin in the seriously aggravating factors which were identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks.

[63] They were:

(i) The Petitioner was the complainant’s stepfather who should have protected her. Instead he breached the trust expected of him, and the breach was gross.

(ii) The rape offences took place continuously over a long period of time. Such an experience “will surely scar her for the rest of her life” [Record p24].

(iii) She was a child of 10 years. It is not clear what factors the learned judge took into account when fixing the starting point on the tariff. The age of the child, if very young, could yet be an aggravating factor. In this case it is more likely and appropriate that it be put into consideration for arriving at the tariff only, and not added on later as an aggravating factor.

(iv) The frequency of the crime against children in Fiji, and therefore the need for deterrence.

(v) She had been subjected to threats to kill her, assaulted and injured by the Petitioner.

(vi) She was observed to be in real fear of the Petitioner. Such threats besides causing fear and anxiety in the victim over a long period, had postponed the exposure of these offences.
[63] These aggravating factors made this a particularly bad case of child abuse and for the specific crime charged namely rape.

[64] The judge allowed a further 1 year discount on sentence for the period of time spent on remand [Record p25], bringing the sentence on each of the rape counts down to 16 years.

[65] It is not accurate to say, as was submitted in the written submissions, that “the victim was not physically harmed by any violence on her.” She gave evidence of being assaulted and injured on the face, and of attempts at penetration with difficulty for which pain can be assumed. She lost her hymen at age 10 and was in constant fear of his threats to kill or of violence.

[66] The learned sentencing judge was correct in his approach. The Court of Appeal in its judgment at paragraph 18 said:

“Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years. There can be no fault in the sentencing approach of the learned Judge referred to above (in para 13), save as to say we do not consider that allowance should have been made for family circumstances. To that extent the appellant was afforded leniency that he did not deserve.”

We indorse those remarks.

[67] The sentences in this case were at the high end for such sentences. But there was ample reasoning provided for the extent of those necessary and condign sentences. This child suffered greatly and the punishment must reflect society’s abhorrence of such prolonged ill treatment and abuse. The sentences reflected correctly the totality of the offending and were just, in accordance with the purpose expressed in section 4 (1) (a) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

[68] No wrong principle has been demonstrated here, no miscarriage of sentencing discretion. Special leave cannot be granted on the petition against sentence.

Conclusion

[69] In the result:

1. The petition for special leave against conviction and sentence is refused.
2. The decision of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.

Hettige JA:

I agree with the reasoning and the proposed orders of the Chief Justice.

41,688,249821,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. The accused has been convicted after trial in this court of one count of rape; he having raped his 12 year old stepdaughter.
 
 
2. The accused is the husband of the 12 year old’s mother and it is therefore her step-father. On the 22nd June 2016 the mother had gone to Nabuowalu for a few days to care for her sick brother. While she was away the accused stayed in their simple village house looking after the victim and the two young sons of the second marriage.
 
 
3. During the night of the 22nd/23rd June the girl awoke to find her father on top of her. He had undressed her and was in the process of penetrating her with his penis.
 
 
4. He told her not to shout or say anything. When he had finished and left her she felt blood escaping from her.
 
 
5. A few days later when the mother was due back, he gave her $100 and told her to go up to Labasa and stay with an aunt. 
 The girl told the aunt of the rape and she suggested that she go home and tell her mother which she did. Sadly the mother was unsympathetic and unsupportive and sent the 12 year old on the bus alone to Dreketi to report the incident.
 
 
6. The girl being younger than 13, consent to the act is not 
 in issue, nor would it have been in this case.
 
 
7. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the tariff for rapes of children is a term of imprisonment of between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj  CAV003 of 2014).
 
 
8. The accused is 55 years old and married with 3 children under 10. His wife is caring for the family. He had been working as a security man earning only $120 per fortnight.
 
 
9. He is the only income earner for this young family and his nocturnal lust therefore will cost them dearly.
 
 
10. As in all cases of family rape, of which unfortunately there are too many in Fiji, there has been a gross breach of trust: a breach of trust given to him by the mother and a breach of the trust given by a young child in his care. That has to be a serious aggravating factor along with the aggravation of nocturnal abuse while the child was sleeping.
 
 
11. The accused has a clear record and he was held on remand for approximately 2 months before the matter came to trial. 
 
 
12. I take a starting point of 12 years imprisonment for the offence. For the aggravation of breach of trust and nocturnal abuse I add a term of 4 years to that total.
 
 
13. In recognition of his clear record and the time spent in custody I deduct 2 years. The convicted accused will serve a total term of imprisonment of 14 years imprisonment.
 
 
14. Apart from the clear record there is very little mitigation available to the accused. The Court does however recognize the hardship that this sentence will cause to his family and a minimum term before he can be eligible for parole may in some way give the family the prospect of reunion.
 
 
15. The accused will spend 10 years in custody before he is eligible to apply for parole.
 
 
Summary:
 
 
Head sentence : Fourteen years’ imprisonment
Minimum term : Ten years’ imprisonment.

42,689,76137,"RULING

[1] Following a trial in the High Court at Lautoka, the appellant was convicted of rape and sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment. The sentence was imposed on 3 June 2011. The appellant filed an appeal against conviction and sentence, but when the matter came before this Court for leave hearing, the appellant told the Court that he wished to proceed with appeal against sentence only. Since the appellant is unrepresented and was convicted of a serious offence, I proceed to consider leave for both conviction and sentence pursuant to section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act. 

[2] The appellant presents two complaints against his conviction. His first contention is that his confession made under caution was obtained involuntarily. His second contention is that the victim's grandmother who holds a grudge against him concocted the allegation of rape against him.

[3] At trial the appellant was represented by Legal Aid Counsel. Counsel took objection to the admissibility of confession on the ground that the police assaulted the appellant in order to obtain his confession. The learned trial judge held a voir dire to determine the objection and found the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was voluntarily made by the appellant. 

[4] The appellant has failed to establish any arguable basis to disturb the trial judge's finding in the voir dire. After admitting the confession the learned trial judge gave careful directions to the assessors as to how to weigh the confession in light of the allegation put forward by the appellant against the police officer who obtained the confession from him. This ground is not arguable.

[5] The appellant's second complaint that the victim's grandmother concocted the rape because she held grudge against him was put to the assessors by the trial judge. The assessors did not accept that the rape was concocted but believed the victim's testimony and found the appellant guilty. The trial judge accepted the guilty opinions and convicted the appellant. The appellant has failed to show any arguable basis to disturb the conviction. This ground is not arguable. 

[6] Leave to appeal against conviction therefore must fail. 

[7] The appellant's sole complaint against his sentence is that it is harsh and excessive.

[8] The learned judge gave detailed reasons for the sentence that was imposed on the appellant. One matter that is of concern is the manner in which the learned judge dealt with the starting point and the aggravating factors. In the present case, the learned judge picked up a term that was beyond the term of 10 years for rape of a juvenile girl by a person in breach of trust as recommended by the Full Court in Asesela Drotini v The State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0001 of 2005S.

[9] At para 14 of the sentencing remarks the learned judge said:

""I am, in the circumstances, inclined to pick up a starting point of 14 years for the sentence in this case to reflect that the victim is very small compared to those in the two cases referred to above. I add four years for the considerations in paragraphs 10 and 11 above, which I consider as seriously aggravating circumstances to enhance the sentence to reach 18 years.""

[10] The learned judge dealt with the aggravating factors at paragraphs [10] and [11] as follows:

""Learned counsel for the State and for the accused accepted the above range of sentence for the rape of children. They also addressed court on aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to assist court in regard to the imposition of an appropriate sentence on the accused. I have considered their submissions very carefully in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree in determining the sentence.

The victim in this case was only four years of age at the time of the incident. She was just stepping into her formative ages and moving around playing. The accused, who was fifty, had three grown up children, two of them were married. The accused had four grandchildren from the two married daughters out of whom two were in or about the same age as that of the victim. There cannot be any doubt that the accused, in the circumstances, knew the value of children and that they needed protection and shelter from adults. Despite that the accused raped the little girl, who was in the age group of his grandchildren to satisfy his unnatural lust.""

[11] It is clear that the learned judge based his high starting point of 14 years imprisonment on the tender age of the victim. He then used the same fact (i.e. the age of the victim) as an aggravating factor to enhance the appellant's sentence by 4 years. There is an arguable ground that the appellant was punished twice based on the same fact. 

Result
[12] Leave to appeal against conviction is refused.

[13] Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.

43,690,249094,"SENTENCE
 
 
1. On the 17th May 2017 in this Court the accused entered a plea of guilty to two counts of rape of his stepdaughter; the first count being a representative count of oral rape in 2015 when she was 13 years old and the second count being a representative count of carnal knowledge of the same girl in 2016 when she was 14.
 
 
2. Consequent to those pleas and to agreement to relevant facts he was convicted of those two counts and he now comes before the Court to be sentenced.
 
 
3. The facts proffered by the prosecution and agreed to by the accused are as follows:
 
 
4. In early 2015 the victim Lucy (not her real name) moved into the accused’s home, Lucy’s mother having entered into a relationship with him. On many occasions in the course of that year, at times when the mother was away from the home the accused would force Lucy to perform indecent acts on him, forcing her head onto him. She would complain and say that it hurt her mouth but he would insist.
 
 
5. On two different dates in October 2016 the accused raped Lucy, once in his room in the house and once on the plantation. On Christmas Eve of that year the accused found Lucy alone at home doing cleaning chores. He told her to undress whereupon he raped her on the kitchen floor.
 
 
6. During Police investigations the accused admitted the offences, saying that “bad intentions” were the reason. He told the Police that he knew it was wrong, but he always forced her. 
 
 
Mitigation
 
 
7. The accused is aged 38, is married with a 10 year old daughter. He lives in a de facto relationship with Lucy’s mother in Qamea, Taveuni. He works as a subsistence farmer to support his family. He also supports his elderly mother.
 
 
8. He has a clear record with no previous criminal convictions. 
The Law
 
 
9. The maximum penalty for rape is a term of life imprisonment and the tariff for rapes of children has been determined by the Supreme Court to be between 10 and 16 years. (Anand Abhay Raj CAV 003 of 2014.
 
 
10. This Court has often referred to the shocking statistics revealing the prevalence of rape in every part of this country; and rapes of children, especially children within the “family” are particularly egregious. 
 
 
11. Sexual abuse of children by a parent or senior relative is a gross breach of trust as well as a breach of several of the child’s constitutional rights.
 
 
12. The Constitution of the Republic of Fiji 2013, provides in the Bill of Rights for the rights of children and by section 41(1) (c) “every child has the right to family care, protection and guidance:’ and by section 41(1)(d) “ every child has the right to be protected from abuse......any form of violence and inhumane treatment”.
 
 
13. Any breach of these rights recognized not only by the Constitution but by international covenants must add strong aggravating circumstances to an already abhorrent situation. 
 
 
14. For each count of rape that the accused is convicted of I take a starting point of twelve years imprisonment. To that starting point I add 6 years for the aggravating features being:

  
• The gross breach of trust that a daughter can expect from her father (including a step father)
 
• The breach of the child’s constitutional rights to safety and freedom from violence
 

bringing the interim total to one of 18 years.
 
 
15. The accused’s family circumstances afford him no value in mitigation, but his clear record and co-operation with the authorities and this court will allow him credit.
 
 
16. He has spent 4 months in custody awaiting trial and for that together with his clear record the sentence is reduced by 2 years.
 
 
17. His plea of guilty in this Court is also to his credit saving Court time but more importantly avoiding the need for the child to relive her traumatic ordeals in evidence. For that the sentence is reduced by 3 years making a final sentence of 13 years. That is the sentence that this Court passes on the convict for each of the two rapes, each to be served concurrently with each other.
 
 
18. The counts being “representative”, the Court can only take into account one rape for each count.
 
 
19. It is ordered that the accused serve ten years of his sentence before he be eligible to apply for parole.
 
 
20. A domestic violence restraining order is already in place (Taveuni Magistrates Court, 27 February 2017) and will remain in force until further order.
 
 
Summary
 
 
21. First count. Imprisonment for 13 years.
 Second count. Imprisonment for 13 years to be served concurrently with Count 1.
 
 
22. A minimum term of 10 years to be served before being eligible to apply for parole.

44,691,75427,"SENTENCE

[1] After trial in the Magistrates Court at Lautoka on one count of rape and two counts of indecent assault, the accused was found guilty and convicted on the 19th February 2010.

[2] On the 10th March 2010 the learned Magistrate, on application by the State, transferred the matter to this Court for sentencing pursuant to section 190(c) of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2010.

[3]

i. The facts reveal that on an unknown day in 2008, the accused took the victim, his own daughter, on horseback to the village of Abaca. Whilst there, he ordered her to remove her clothes and lie on the ground. He removed his own clothes and raped her. She was aged 14 at the time.

ii. On the 20th January 2009 at about 9.00pm, the same victim was sleeping in a room with her two younger brothers and the accused. Her father woke her and called her to the floor, pushing the boys away, pulled off her panties, rubbed his penis against her vagina and licked her indecently there.

iii. On the 24th January 2009 the accused again on the floor of the bedroom made the same victim lie close to him. He removed her clothes, rubbed both his tongue and penis over her vagina until he ejaculated.

[4] The accused said nothing in mitigation, but submitted a written ""application for bail pending trial"". This was totally misconceived in that there was to be no trial in this Court, and bail was totally out of the question. However in that application he did refer to several mitigating factors. He submits that he is the sole breadwinner for his impoverished family, that he has elderly parents and a father who is handicapped. He also submitted a letter of reference from the prison which claims that he is a member of the Western Ward Rugby Team. He is a role model in the team and a source of inspiration to younger unemployed men. He is 44 years old and unemployed.

[5] Rape and indecent assaults by a father on a 14 year old daughter does not make him a role model in my Court. The crimes are abominable and are becoming far too common in Fiji. The authorities state that rape of children must incur a starting point of ten years.

[6] In the case of State v Marawa [2004] FJHC 338, Gates J. (as he then was) passed a sentence of 13 years on a 51 year old for raping a 14 year old in his care. His Lordship said ""rape is the most serious sexual offence. The Courts have reflected increasing public intolerance for this crime, by hardening their hearts to offenders and by meting out harsh sentences"". I agree.

[7] In Poese v State, an appeal against sentence for rape. Shameem J. was reviewing a Magistrate’s sentence for a man convicted of raping his own 12 year old daughter found that a 15 year sentence for rape to be justified in the circumstances.

[8] The rape in the present case and the indecent assaults were a gross breach of trust. A 14 year old is still not mature and the animal behaviour of her father will surely scar her for the rest of her life. The Courts cannot ignore the severity of such behaviour. It is a breach of trust of the worst kind and a destruction of a father/daughter relationship.

[9] I take a starting point for the rape a term of imprisonment for 12 years. There is no meaningful mitigation and in any event he has four previous convictions for rape in the year 2000. Those convictions afford him no credit. The fact that it was his own daughter and that he used his status as her father to override her will I take as a serious aggravating feature for which I will add two years to the sentence. For the rape he is therefore sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.

[10] The maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment and in the case of State v Kumar [2003] FJHC 71 Shameem J. said that indecent assaults on children should attract sentences of 3 years imprisonment. That is the starting point I take in this case for each of the two indecent assaults.

[11] The victim at 14 years of age is still a child and at the mercy of her aggressive father. To have committed these offences in front of her two young brothers is a further aggravating feature. For that I increase his sentence by one year making a total sentence for each indecent assault a term of 4 years.

[12] The sentences for the two indecent assaults are to be served concurrently, but pursuant to section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I order that two years of those sentences be served consecutively to the rape sentence. The total period of imprisonment therefore will be a term of 16 years imprisonment.

01. The Director of Public Prosecution had preferred the following charge against the accused above named.

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1) and (2)(b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.
Particulars of Offence

TALAIASI MUALUVU on 29th of June, 2012, at Savusavu in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of N.D with his finger, the said N.D. being under the age of 13.

02. When the Plea was taken up on the 08th day of August, 2013 the accused had pleaded not guilty to the charge against him. But on 14/04/2014, when the trial was about to begin, the accused through his counsel informed that he wish to reconsider his plea. Information was read out and explained the charge in both languages. Accused after understanding the charge pleaded guilty to the charge. Accepting the Plea to be unequivocal this court found him guilty and convicted him under Section 207(1) and (2)(b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

03. State Counsel submitted following summary of facts of which the accused admitted. 

04. The accused, Talaiasi Mualuvu was 18 years old, unemployed Fijian youth from Korosi Village in Natuvu at the time of the offence. On 29th of June 2012, the victim and her brother namely Yavaki Junior (5 years old) travelled to school together and upon arriving, discovered that there would be no classes that day as their teacher was unwell. They met a fellow classmate named Timoci and all started playing together in the kindergarten block. Whilst they were playing, the accused approached them and told them to leave the place they were playing in. As the 2 boys ran off, he grabbed the victim and carried her into a toilet stall. He then took off her pants and panty and began fondling her vagina, then inserted his finger into her vagina. The victim was crying throughout the whole incident. Her brother, noticing she was not with them, went to look for her and heard her crying from toilet stall. He peeped through the door and saw the accused inside the stall with the victim and victim's pant was down. He then told the victim to open the door, and the victim was also shouting at her brother to open the door and take her away. When the accused eventually released the victim and her brother went straight home and reported the incident to their mother, Takapi Lutumailagi. She then informed her husband, who reported the matter to the police. The accused was arrested and caution interviewed about the incident. He admitted during his caution interview that he had taken the victim to the toilet stall, taken off her panty and inserted his finger in her vagina three times and that the victim was crying when he penetrated her vagina with his finger. He also made a statement admitting to the offence when initially charged by the police. He was produced in court and stands charged with rape contrary to section 207(1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009. 

Tariffs for Rape

05. In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:

""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must more nearly reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

06. In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008). The court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & others HAC 0008 of 1996, the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

07. In State v AV [2009] FJHC24: JAC 192.2008(2 February 2009) the court stated:-

""Rape is the most serious form of sexual assault. In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual assault on children. Children are our future. The courts have a positive obligation under the Constitution to protect the vulnerable from any form of violence or sexual abuse. Sexual offenders must be deterred from committing this kind of offences.

...

The tariff for rape of a child is between 10-14 years imprisonment. (Mutch v State, Cr. App. AAU0060/99, Mani v State, Cr. App. No.HAA0053/02L, State v Saitava, Cr. Case No: HAC10/07, State v Marawa, Cr. Case No: 016/03, Drotini v State, Cr. App. AAU001/05 and State v Tony, Cr. App. No. HAA003/(08)"" 

08. The accused is 20 years of age. He is unemployed and lives at Korosi, Cakaudrove, with his parents and other siblings. He has class 08 level education. When arrested he co-operated with the police and made confession in his Record of Interview. He was in remand custody for well over 10 months. He pleaded guilty before commencement of the trial. 

09. According to medical report of the victim had no visible injuries noted by the doctor. The victim was examined after 6 days of the alleged incident. 

10. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially sections 4(1), 4 (2) and 15(3), to determine an appropriate sentence.

11. Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The victim was 03 years old at the time of the incident.
	2.	The act of the accused made the victim insecure.
	3.	The accused had caused adverse psychological trauma the effect of which is difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologist or sociologist.
	4.	The accused has instilled a sense of fear into the victim which may affect her whole life.

12. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

(a) The accused pleaded guilty before the commencement of the trial.
(b) By pleading guilty he has saved the victim from having to re-live her ordeal all over again whilst giving evidence.
(c) Accused was 18 years and 09 months old at the time of committing the offence. 
(d) He co-operated with the Police and made confession in his record of Caution Interview Statement.
(e) He is unemployed and lives with his parents and his siblings. 
(f) He is remorseful.
(g) He was in remand for more than 10 months.
(h) Accused has no previous conviction.

13. Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I take 10 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add two years for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 12 years. I deduct 03 years for the mitigating factors.

14. In summary you are sentenced to 09 years imprisonment. 

15. The accused was born on 23/09/1993. He was 18 years and 09 months old at the time of offending. He committed the offence just entering his adulthood. He has spent over 10 months in remand for this case. 

16. Considering all and acting in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 05 years as non-parole period.

17. 30 days to Appeal.

46,693,73500,"SENTENCE

	1.	On 5 November, 2013, in the presence of your counsel, you pleaded guilty to the following information:

Statement of Offence
ACT INTENDED TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to section 255(a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence
ASALUSI DENI on the 11th day of May 2013 at Nasinu, in the Central Division, with intent to do grievous harm to ASALUSI BUAKULA DENI unlawfully wounded the said ASALUSI BUAKULA DENI with a spear.

	1.	On 25 November 2013, the prosecution read their summary of facts in court. Briefly, they were as follows. On 11 May 2013, the accused was 60 years old, married with three children aged 27 years, 23 years and 10 years old. The family lived in a family house at Newtown Nasinu. The eldest child in the family was the complainant. He was his father's namesake.

	2.	On 10 May 2013 (Friday), the complainant and his wife were drinking grog with a neighbor and his wife. At 10.30pm, the complainant and his friends went to a nightclub in town. They returned in the morning (ie. 11 May 2013 – a Saturday), and continued drinking liquor until 11am. The complainant then went to his father's house to ask for food. The father said there was no food. An argument erupted. The complainant swore at his father, and other members of the family.

	3.	He then got some stones and threw them on his father's rooftop. The father (accused) ran to the complainant, and the two exchanged punches. The accused then went and got a fishing spear from under his house. He then went and speared the complainant's neck with the same. The complainant was injured in the neck, as shown in his medical report. He was later rushed to the hospital for treatment. He spent one month at CWM Hospital.

	4.	The above facts were admitted by the accused's counsel, on 25 November 2013. The court found him guilty as charged, and convicted him accordingly. He admitted one previous conviction of ""assault occasioning actual bodily harm"" in the last 10 years. In his plea in mitigation, he said he was provoked by his son, the complainant. He said, he co-operated with the police during their investigation, and admitted the offence when caution interviewed by police. He said, he had reconciled with his son, the complainant.

	5.	The court checked with the complainant and the accused's wife to see whether or not the family had really reconciled. In an affidavit dated 20 February 2014, the complainant said, he had reconciled with his father. He admitted, he caused the problem by making his father angry on 11 May 2013.

	6.	The accused's wife swore an affidavit on 20 February 2014. Although, she said, she had reconciled with the accused, she said, she still feared for her life. Previously, the accused had threatened to kill her, if he was released from custody. On 7 March 2014, she repeated the above position in detail in an affidavit.

	7.	In State v Semi Waqawai, Criminal Case No. HAC 007 of 2012S, High Court, Suva, I said the following:

""...5 I will deal first with counts nos. 2, 4 and 5, because they involved the more serious offence of ""act intended to cause grievous harm"", contrary to section 255(a) of the Crimes Decree 2009. The law makers have treated this offence as a very serious matter, and have prescribed the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. This is somewhat similar to the view expressed by Parliament when they passed the equivalent offence in section 224 of the repealed Penal Code, Chapter 17, wherein they also prescribed a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

6 In State v Maba Mokubula, Criminal Appeal No. HAA 0052 of 2003S, Her Ladyship Madam Justice N. Shameem had reviewed several Court of Appeal and High Court cases, on the offence and said as follows:

""...On the basis of these authorities, the tariff for sentences under section 224 of Penal Code, is between 6 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. In a case of an attack by a weapon, the starting point should range from 2 years imprisonment to 5 years, depending on the nature of the weapon. Aggravating factors would be:

	1.	seriousness of the injuries;
	2.	evidence of premeditation or planning;
	3.	length and nature of the attack;
	4.	special vulnerability of the victim.
Mitigating factors would be:
	1.	previous good character;
	2.	guilty plea
	3.	provocation by the victim;
	4.	apology, reparation or compensation.

In general terms, the more serious and permanent the injuries, the higher the sentences should be. As a matter of principle, a suspended sentence is not appropriate for a case of act with intent to cause grievous harm not only because it is contrary to the accepted tariff, but also because section 29(3)(a) of the Penal Code contains a legislative fetter to the section 29 powers to impose a suspended sentence for crimes of violence (DPP-v-Saviriano Radovu Crim. App. No. HAA 0006 of 1996; State-v-Senitiki Naqa and Others Crim. App. No. HAA 0023 of 2003S)...""

7. I would hold that Her Ladyship Madam Justice N. Shameem's view above mentioned, also applied to section 255 (a) of the Crimes Decree 2009...""

	1.	The aggravating factors, in this case, were as follows:
		(i) The nature of the attack. Using a spear to resolve a family dispute is not appropriate, and should be discouraged. This was a father-son dispute, and the use of a spear to settle a family problem is simply not right. The accused should have called the police to take his disobedient son away, rather than sticking a spear in his neck;

		(ii) Seriousness of the Injuries. The spear injury to the complainant's neck was very serious, and could have easily caused his death. He lost consciousness, was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit and was hospitalized for a month.

	2.	The mitigating factors were as follows:
		(i) The accused pleaded guilty to the charge 5 months after the first call, and therefore saved the court's time;

		(ii) The accused was obviously provoked by his drunken and disobedient son. It was obvious the son (complainant) started the commotion;

		(iii) The accused had reconciled with his son and his wife, although his wife is still frightened of him;

		(iv) Accused had been remanded in custody for approximately 1 year 1 month.

	3.	I start with a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. I add 3 years for the aggravating factors, making a total of 5 years imprisonment. I deduct 3 years for the mitigating factors, leaving a balance of 2 years imprisonment.

	4.	Asalusi Deni, for spearing your son in the neck, I sentence you to 2 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 1 year imprisonment, effective forthwith.

	5.	In addition to the above, and for the protection of your children and your wife, I issue the following non-molestation orders:
		(i) You must not physically assault or abuse your children and wife;
		(ii) You must not threaten to physically assault or abuse the above persons;
		(iii) You must not damage or threaten to damage any property of the above persons;
		(iv) You must not threaten, intimidate or harass the above persons;
		(v) You must not behave in an abusive, provocative or offensive manner towards the above persons;
		(vi) You must not encourage any person to engage in behaviours against the above persons, which are prohibited by the above orders.

	6.	Any breach of the above orders, may on the application of your children and/or your wife, be brought before the Court, for you to be dealt with accordingly.

",1,1,0,1,2,sentence,1232
47,694,78441,"JUDGMENT

Casey, Kapi and Handley, JJ

The appellant was found guilty on two counts of rape and four counts of indecent assault and was sentenced in the High Court at Suva on 15 November 1999 to concurrent prison terms of 7 years on each of the rape counts and 4 years on each of the counts of indecent assault, making a total of 7 years overall. He appeals against his conviction on all counts and the State appeals against the sentences pursuant to leave ranted under s2 I(2)(c) of the Court of Appeal Act (Amendment) Decree 1990. Originally there were two further counts of indecent assault but these were withdrawn after the complainant gave no evidence incriminating the accused.

Charges and evidence summary

The prosecution alleged that the offences were committed at the appellant's house against five young girls ranging in age from 9 to 15 at different times over a period from 1990 to 1997. The evidence from the complainants and other witnesses made it clear that he associated with numbers of young girls who were frequent visitors to his house where they played with computers and watched videos and engaged in other activities with him. In his police statement he said he used to teach them maths and English and whatever they needed. Some of them stayed overnight and slept there, and occasionally one might bring a young brother during the day, but he did not sleep there. The appellant had a sophisticated video camera and took photos of the girls which could be displayed on the computer where various features could be altered. Images of some of the girls were printed from it and produced in evidence; they showed complainants naked in a bath or having their hair shampooed with the appellant alongside in one. Several witnesses described how he would come into the bathroom naked while they were there, and the overall impression of the evidence of the general activities in the house, and of the appellant's indulgence in what may be colloquially described as ""slap and tickle"" with them, is of a relationship with an undercurrent of sexuality between him and these young girls.

In the first count he was charged with raping M (then aged 9) between 1 September and 31 December 1990, and in the second count with indecently assaulting her between 1 August and 31 December of that year. In her evidence she said she often slept at the house which had two bedrooms, one of which was where the appellant slept and she used the other which had two beds. She described being awakened by him coming into her bed (which he did frequently) where he engaged in sexual activity involving kissing and playing with her breasts and attempting to put his penis inside her, eventually having full intercourse on a Saturday night over her objections. When he left after about half an hour she went to the bathroom and cleaned herself and washed her blood-stained underpants, and went home the following morning. She said nothing about this to her parents and continued to visit and have sex with him until 1996 when she never heard from him again. Cross-examination brought out inconsistencies with what she had said in the Magistrates' Court and apparent confusion over dates and at one stage an admission that her evidence against the accused had been ""fabricated"", but it became clear in re- examination she had not understood the meaning of that word put to her by counsel and she affirmed the truth of her previous evidence.

The third count alleged indecent assault on A between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1995. She gave evidence of first knowing the appellant in 1990 and later visiting his house with her cousin M and her sister. She slept there and even lived there for a period and said that when she was 12 he used to play with her breasts on many occasions and put his fingers down her pants. She was cross-examined at length about dates and occasions of her visits to the house, demonstrating some confusion. In response to further questioning she stated that the appellant put his fingers inside her vagina which she found painful. Mr. Raza made much of the fact that her hymen was found to be intact on subsequent medical examination, but the doctor called as a witness explained that penetration by a finger would not necessarily rupture it, so that this circumstance could not be regarded as a conclusive indication that the witness was lying. There were also inconsistencies with her previous police statement and evidence she gave in the Magistrates' Court.

In the fourth count there was a charge of indecent assault on V between 1 January and 31 May 1997, when she was 13. She first visited the house at the invitation of her friend MS (another complainant) and said that appellant showed her around and to her surprise carried her into his room and threw her on his waterbed. They watched television and played with the computer. He entertained them by enlarging the breasts on photos of herself and MS and changed her facial expression. She said he and another girl had taken photos of them in the bathtub and identified those printed from the computer and produced in evidence. She described how he put shampoo on their hair and alleged that he was fondling her left breast and touched her private parts briefly while feeling in the water for the soap. She slept at the house that night, but left next day and did not go back. As with the other witnesses cross-examination brought out discrepancies with the evidence she had given in the Magistrates' Court and with her statement to the police.

MS was the subject of the fifth count containing the second charge of rape, alleged to have occurred during 1996. She said she lived near appellant's house which she visited many times and remembered being shown pictures of naked girls on the computer. She went there once at night when she was 13 and said that after watching a movie with him and showering he carried her into his bedroom and put her on his bed where he had intercourse with her and he stopped after she told him to. She went home next morning and told no one what had happened. Apart from a visit for a birthday party she did not go back to the house again. She also described incidents in the bathroom and shower similar to those mentioned by the previous complainant, including the fact that he was fiddling around with another girl's breast while she was in the bathtub with her.

This complainant then referred to a letter she had written to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 26 September 1999 before the case started withdrawing the statement she had made to the police about the appellant in 1997, and stating that she was forced to give it and that she had nothing against him and did not want to testify. In explanation (still in examination-in-chief) she named the police officer who had made her say he had raped her, by threatening her with jail. She said in answer to further questioning that the part in the statement about the night she slept with the appellant was true. She was closely cross-examined about subsequent discussions with the police and the prosecutor and about the truth of her letter, and about problems with some dates she had given for the events she described. and discrepancies between her evidence and her police statement. She agreed that the touching of her friend's breast in the bath could have been accidental. She and a cousin had visited the appellant at prison while he was in custody following his arrest. He was later released on bail.

The sixth count was one of indecent assault of on 17 May 1997 when she was 14. She met the appellant on the street when looking for a job in 1997 with her friend. She said he winked at them and called them across to ask what they were looking for and, when he was told, offered her work at his factory where she was employed for two days. On the second afternoon he invited them to his house where they had lunch and afterwards took their photos on his computerised camera, and then he drove them home. They went back to the house on Saturday in his car at about 10.30 am. There were other girls present, including the next witness Leba, when they arrived and one of them showed them around the place including the appellant's bedroom upstairs. She was the last of the five to move out of that room and said he came in before she left, closed the door, grabbed her and started massaging her breasts and tried to put his finger into her vagina. She objected but he prevented her from leaving and she finally bit his hand and got away. She estimated this lasted about 5 minutes. He then drove her home and she saw no more of him. She was cross-examined about relatively minor differences between her evidence and her statement to the police, and about the contents of a medical report. She was unable to recall sexual intercourse with a boyfriend when the question was put to her.

Leba was called by the State to allow defence cross-examination in which she was asked about E's visit to the house. She was 12 at the time; and said four of them including were playing cards in the computer room upstairs and none of them went into any other rooms and all came downstairs together. After that they took E home. She put the visit at 22 July. Another prosecution witness, Sainiana. aged 13 at the time, was E's friend who was also given work at appellant's factory and she said she went with her to his house on the second day they were on the job (Tuesday 29 April) when they were shown around then came downstairs and had tea and were entertained on the computer with photos he had taken of them. She said nothing about going into the bedroom, but she seems to be describing their first visit. On the other hand, E said the indecencies she described occurred on Saturday 17 May (after some uncertainty about the month), nearly three weeks after that first visit. Another witness, Vani, who would then have been about 13, gave similar evidence about E's visit although she was thoroughly confused about the month. She described the group of girls being in appellant's bedroom where another (R) was asleep on his bed and said they watched him manipulating photos on the computer there, and then she, E, and Leba all came down together while the appellant stayed with R.

The prosecution then called four witnesses who were young girls at the relevant times to give evidence of similar facts in relation to the charges of indecent assault. They were all friendly with the appellant and visited his house. Some spoke about conduct in the bath and showers similar to that described by the complainants above and of physical contact which could be seen as bordering on the sexually suggestive, even to the stage of sleeping with him on his waterbed.

Evidence was given by doctors who had examined the complainants and they were closely cross-examined about inconsistencies between the information in their reports and what the girls said in their evidence, and the latter were also questioned at length about these matters.

At the close of the prosecution evidence the Judge rightly rejected a submission of no case to answer. The appellant called no evidence and made a brief unsworn statement denying the allegations against him, and referred to his police statement to the same effect. That statement was produced as an exhibit and given to the assessors.

Grounds of Appeal

A number of the grounds advanced were without substance for reasons which were fully canvassed with Mr. Raza in the course of his submissions, and we did not call on Mrs. Olutimayin to respond to them. There is accordingly 'no need to discuss them in this judgment and we can turn directly to the matter of real concern, namely His Lordship's directions on corroboration and similar fact evidence.

The common-law requirement for corroboration of the complainant's evidence in sexual cases is a frequent source of confusion and was criticised by this Court in Maika Sagonaivi v The State {CA 8/97; 13 November 1998). It has been abolished by statute in New Zealand. However it is still the law in Fiji Islands, and assessors must be directed (and Judges bear in mind) that even if they believe the complainant, it is dangerous to convict on his or her evidence unless it is corroborated or supported in some material particular by independent testimony implicating the accused in the commission of the offence. It is for the Judge to determine whether there is any evidence capable of being corroboration, and for the assessors to decide whether to accept it, and if so, whether it amounts to corroboration. They should also be told that they can convict bearing in mind this warning, if they are convinced of the truth of the complainant's testimony. All this is relatively straightforward and can be put to them in simple language, but the Judge embarked on a lengthy discussion of this and the associated topic of similar fact evidence, with quotations from decided cases and texts. a course which is unlikely to be helpful to laypersons.

We think he got the message across through all this material of the danger of convicting on uncorroborated evidence, and of the general theory of similar fact evidence and its role as corroboration in appropriate circumstances. However, he omitted an important part of such a direction in failing to point out those elements of the charges requiring corroboration, and in failing to refer to appropriate evidence; nor did he tell the assessors that in respect of the two rape counts there was no evidence capable of amounting to corroboration. Counsel agreed with us that there could be no dispute over the identity of the appellant as the offender if the offences occurred, nor could there be any issue of consent in dealing with children of the ages involved in them, so that the only elements requiring corroboration were the acts of intercourse in the two rape charges, and the physical contact in the other four, No relevant objection was taken to the summing up by either Counsel, and in particular His Lordship was not asked to direct the assessors that here was no corroboration of the evidence of the complainants in the two counts of rape.

We think these omissions in the directions and the general confusion likely to have been left in the assessors' minds from its discursive nature are serious enough to warrant setting aside the convictions, unless the proviso in s23(1) of the Court of Appeal Act should be applied if we consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. This first requires attention to the adequacy of His Lordship's direction on the facts, also criticised in the grounds of appeal. The hearing took 16 days during the period from 13 October to 4 November 1999, on which day counsel made extensive closing submissions. There was then a delay of 7 days before His Lordship's summing up, which seems with respect an unusually long time to take for preparation, even granted the extensive evidence which had to be covered and the intervention of a Monday holiday. The assessors had the benefit of full coverage by counsel of most of the material aspects of the case before that lengthy adjournment, and although His Lordship's summary of the complainants' testimony with its inconsistencies and areas of dispute was brief, we think it was enough to enable the assessors to recall the salient features insufficient detail to make proper assessments of its credibility. They were unanimous in their verdicts of guilty, with which His Lordship agreed.

The effective corroboration of the indecent assault charges was to be found in the photographs and the similar fact evidence. That such evidence in appropriate circumstances can constitute corroboration in cases such as these was confirmed by the House of Lords in D.P.P. v. Kilbourne [1973] AC 729 and we quote from the opinion of Lord Reid at p409:

""Where several children, between whom there can have been no collaboration in concocting a story, all tell similar stories, it appears to me that the conclusion that each is telling the truth is likely to be inescapable and the corroboration is very strong..... Once there are enough children to show a system, there is no ground for refusing to recognise the obvious that they can corroborate each other.""

In the later case of D.P.P. v. P [1991] 2 AC 447 the House of Lords discussed the nature of the relationship between the different acts put forward as similar fact evidence capable of supporting a complainant, and in the opinion of Lord Mackay of Clashfern at 462 (whim whom the other members agreed), if there is a sufficiently strong connection between the circumstances spoken of by the complainants for their testimony mutually to support each other, then the evidence of one may be admitted to support another.

We are satisfied that the evidence of indecent assault by the various complainants in this case, coupled with the descriptions from them and other witnesses about the activities in the bathroom and showers, makes the likelihood that each complainant was telling the truth so strong that it would be an affront to commonsense to ignore that evidence. This conclusion is reinforced by consideration of the general background nature of the appellant's relationship with so many young girls over the period. As noted above, His Lordship did not put the matter in this way to the assessors, confining his directions to general principles. If he had, the result for the appellant would have been quite damning, and we are accordingly satisfied that his conviction on the indecent assault charges was inevitable.

The only reservation might have been over E, whose account of being waylaid in the bedroom after the others had left conflicted with their evidence that they all came down the stairs together. The assessors obviously believed her description of what the appellant did to her, and we are satisfied that the others could well have been mistaken in their recollection after the lapse of such a time between that event in 1997 and the trial date. They would have had no particular reason to remember such a common-place action as descending the stairs on that occasion. We do not think the assessors could have regarded their evidence as sufficient raise any reasonable doubt about her testimony.

So far as the rape charges are concerned, there was no corroboration and the assessors were not told this by the Judge, although the point was made to them by Mr. Raza in his closing address. But this would not be sufficient. If they had been properly directed they could have found the appellant guilty, bearing in mind the warning about the dangers of doing so without corroboration, if they were convinced of the truth of the complainants' testimony. The evidence of M in the first count has been summarised above. The assessors clearly believed her. She gave a circumstantial account of the Appellant's conduct with her and of his attempts to have intercourse, leading to penetration on the Saturday night, and then described washing herself and her bloodstained panties afterwards. This account has the real ring of truth about it and we are satisfied that even with a proper direction on corroboration, there must inevitably have been a verdict of guilty. However, we cannot say the same of the other rape conviction in count 5 involving MS, having regard to the matters casting doubt upon her credibility referred to in the summary above.

In the light of these conclusions we are satisfied that in spite of the deficiencies in the summing up, there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice in the appellant's convictions on the first count of rape and on the four indecent assault counts, and that the proviso in 23(1) should be applied. A relevant factor in applying the proviso in this case is that experienced defence counsel did not seek further directions from the trial Judge on corroboration and the evidence which was capable of being corroborated. He must have taken the view, that further directions in these matters were not likely to improve his prospects of an acquittal. Accordingly the appeal in respect of those counts is dismissed. But the appeal in respect of the second charge of rape (count 5) is allowed, and a new trial is ordered.

Sentence Appeal

The State appeals against the leniency of the sentences. The maximum for indecent assault under s154 (1) of the Penal Code is five years, and we are not persuaded that concurrent sentences of four years on each of the counts were manifestly lenient as claimed in the grounds of appeal. The real issue is the adequacy of the 7 years imposed concurrently on the two counts of rape, which must now be considered in the light of the successful appeal against the second. His Lordship was at pains to emphasise the aggravating features of the offending, in which the appellant emerged as a devious paedophile winning the confidence of young girls and preying on them sexually until they attained maturity. There were no mitigating features.

This Court has recommended that the starting point for rape should be 7 years where there are no aggravating or mitigating circumstances to be adjusted up or down to take them into account: see Mohammed Kasim v The State (Criminal Appeal 21 of 19935) and Maika Soqonaivi v The State. His Lordship referred to these guidelines in his sentencing remarks and it is difficult to understand his failure to go beyond the starting point of 7 years to take into account the seriousness of the aggravating features of this offence against a nine-year old girl whom the appellant had befriended and who regarded him as a trusted adult. A prison term of ten years must be regarded as the minimum appropriate in the circumstances and the appeal is allowed to the extent of increasing that sentence accordingly.

Result

1. The appeal against conviction is allowed in respect of count 5 alleging unlawful carnal knowledge and that conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered.

2. The State's appeal against sentence is allowed to the extent of increasing the prison term of 7 years imposed in respect of count 1 alleging unlawful carnal knowledge to 10 years to remain concurrent with the terms imposed in respect of the counts of indecent assault.

Appeal by appellant on second count of rape conviction allowed. Appeal by State on sentence for rape allowed.

• LEMIKI LAUCALA, you pleaded guilty this afternoon to one count of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to section 275 of the Crimes Act No 44 of 2009.
 
• You also admitted on 10/06/2017 at Bureta Village, Levuka you assaulted your 07 year old son with a cassava stem causing him injuries. The multiple injuries are confirmed from the medical report of the victim. 
 
• I am satisfied that your plea was unequivocal and convict you for this charge. 
 
• The maximum penalty for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm under the Crimes Act is 05 years imprisonment. 
 
• In State v Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78; HAC025S.2008S (29 April 2008) her Ladyship justice Shameem said :

“The tariff for this offence appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment.”
  
• In Laisiasa Koroivuki v the State [2013] FJCA 15; AAU0018.2010 (5 March 2013) his Lordship Justice Goundar discussed the guiding principles for determining the starting point in sentencing and observed : 

""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this stage. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff. If the final term falls either below or higher than the tariff, then the sentencing court should provide reasons why the sentence is outside the range.""
 
  
• As for the starting point the UK Sentencing Guidelines states that offences committed in domestic context should be regarded as being no less serious than offences committed in a non-domestic context. Therefore the starting point should be same irrespective of whether the parties are known to each other. 
 
• Considering the nature of offending and your culpability, I select 06 months as the starting point for your sentence. 
 
• In UK Guidelines following are considered as aggravating factors in domestic violence cases :  
• Abuse of trust and abuse of power ;
 
• Victim is particularly vulnerable ;
 
• Impact on children; 
 
• Using contact arrangements with a child to instigate an offence ;
 
• A proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting; 
 
•  history of disobedience to court orders; 
 
• Victim forced to leave home .

 
• When sentencing for a domestic violence a court in Fiji can consider the above aggravating factors and any other factors that would further aggravate the offence. 
 
• In this case I find the breach of trust and age of victim as aggravating this offence and enhance your sentence by 06 months to reach 12 months imprisonment. 
 
• In UK Guidelines the positive good character and provocation are considered as mitigating factors. 
 
• In mitigation you submitted the following :  
• 35 years old;
 
• Married with 3 children;
 
• First offender;
 
• School teacher with 12 years’ experience. 

 
• For the above mitigating factors, I deduct 03 months to reach 09 months imprisonment. 
 
• In UK Guilty Plea guidelines of 2007 it has been held that when an accused pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity the reduction is 1/3 and after a trial date is set 1/4 recommended. But when an accused pleaded guilty at the door of the court or after the trial has started he maybe entitle for only 1/10 discount. 
 
• You pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and for that I deduct 1/3 to reach 06 months imprisonment. 
 
• Now I have to consider whether to suspend this sentence pursuant to section 26(2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act.
 
• Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (“CRC”) provides for the State parties to take all appropriate measures to protect the children from violence whilst in care of parents or guardians. The Government of Fiji has ratified CRC in 1993 and included this in the basic law in this country which is 2013 Constitution. Article 41 of the Constitution specifically states that the every child has the right to be protected from any form of violence, inhuman treatment and punishment.
 
• In view of the international obligations under CRC and bill of rights under the Constitution this court has a duty to protect the children in this country from violence in whatever form. 
 
• In this case without any justification you have assaulted your 07 year old son with a cassava stem in inhuman manner causing him multiple injuries. Your behavior on that day need to be denounced and strong message need to be given to the society that violence against the children in homes would not be tolerated. Hence I find a custodial sentence is warranted in this case to fulfill these objectives.
 
• But I am also mindful full custodial sentence would be detrimental to your children who are small. Further with this conviction it is highly likely you would also lose your job. 
 
• Accordingly I find partly suspended sentence would be justifiable in this case. 
 
• LEMIKI LAUCALA, you are sentenced to 06 months imprisonment. From that you have to serve 03 months in correction center and balance 03 months suspended for 02 years. 
 
• If you commit any offence during the operational period of your suspended sentence you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. 
 
• For the safety of the victim, I also grant a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non-molestation conditions. 
 
• 28 days to appeal.

49,696,271661,"Judgment : 12 October 2018 
 
Date of Punishment : 19 October 2018
 
 
The name of the complainant is suppressed. Accordingly, the complainant will be referred to as “MW”.
 
 
PUNISHMENT
 
 
[1] Stan Davidson Ramere (Stan), in terms of the Amended Information filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), you were charged, along with Eparama Warua, with the following offences:
 
COUNT 1
 
Statement of Offence
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
STAN DAVIDSON RAMERE, on 4 June 2011, at Labasa in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of MW, with his penis, without her consent.
 
 
COUNT 2
 
Statement of Offence
 
AIDING AND ABETTING: Contrary to Section 45 and 207 [1] and [2] [a] of the Crimes Act of 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
EPARAMA WARUA, on 4 June 2011, at Labasa in the Northern Division, aided and abetted STAN DAVIDSON RAMERE to penetrate the vagina of MW, with his penis, without her consent. 
 
[2] Count 1 was the relevant charge against you.
 
[3] You pleaded not guilty to charge against you and the ensuing trial was held over 2 days.
 
[4] At the conclusion of the evidence and after the directions given in the summing up, by a unanimous decision, the three Assessors found you not guilty of Rape. However, by their unanimous decision the three Assessors found you guilty of the lesser or the alternative charge of Defilement of a Young Person between 13 and 16 Years of Age (Defilement), contrary to section 215(1) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009 (Crimes Act). 
 
[5] Having reviewed the evidence, this Court was of the opinion that the unanimous decision of the Assessors in finding you guilty of Defilement was justified. In the circumstances, Court found you guilty and convicted you of Defilement.
 
[6] At the time of the incident, you were 15 years of age, and as such a juvenile. 
 
[7] In terms of the Juveniles Act (as amended) a ""juvenile"" has been defined to mean a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years, and includes a child and a young person. A ""child"" means a person who has not attained the age of fourteen years; while a ""young person"" means a person who has attained the age of fourteen years, but who has not attained the age of eighteen years.
 
[8] Furthermore, Section 20 of the Juveniles Act stipulates that “The words ""conviction"" and ""sentence"" shall not be used in relation to juveniles and any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of juvenile persons, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.”
 
[9] In terms of Section 20 of the Juveniles Act, it is clear that the words ""conviction"" and ""sentence"" shall not be used in relation to juveniles. Thus the reference made by me in my Judgment, dated 12 October 2018, that you have been “convicted” has been made ‘per incuriam’. Court could only have made a finding of guilt against you. 
 
[10] Pursuant to the said finding of guilt, I now proceed to impose the punishment against you.
 
[11] Section 30 of the Juveniles Act imposes certain restrictions on the punishments which Courts could order against juvenile offenders. The Section provides that:
 
“(1) No child shall be ordered to be imprisoned for any offence.

(2) No young person shall be ordered to be imprisoned for an offence, or to be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine, damages or costs, unless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in an approved institution or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained.
 
(3) A young person shall not be ordered to be imprisoned for more than two years for any offence.”
 
Emphasis is mine.
 
[12] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act No. 42 of 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Act”) stipulates the relevant factors that a Court should take into account during the sentencing process. I have duly considered these factors in determining the punishment to be imposed on you. 
 
[13] In terms of Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act, “(1) A person commits a summary offence if he or she unlawfully and carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any person being of or above the age of 13 years and under the age of 16 years.”
 
[14] The offence of Defilement in terms of Section 215 (1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
 
[15] As at 4 June 2011, the complainant was 13 years and 5 months old. Her date of birth is 12 January 1998.
 
[16] The applicable tariff for the offence of Defilement is a suspended sentence to 4 years imprisonment. The law and tariff in relation to the offence of Defilement remains the same as found in the Penal Code (Chapter 17).
 
[17] In Livinai Namami v. The State [1979] FCA 55; [1995] 41 FLR 152 (17 July 1995); where the accused appellant appealed the sentence of 2½ years imprisonment on a charge of Defilement of his girlfriend, aged 15½ years, His Lordship Justice Fatiaki held:
 
“......On the facts of this case there can be little doubt that this was a case of ""a virtuous friendship (between two young people) that ended with them having sexual intercourse with one another."" Certainly it falls within that category of offending where ""... it is inappropriate to pass sentences of a punitive nature.""
 
In this case the learned trial magistrate sentenced the appellant on an incorrect factual basis in that the complainant was not then under 15 years of age at the time of the offence. Furthermore no consideration appears to have been given to the minimal age difference between the parties and finally, as conceded by learned State counsel, there is no record that the learned trial magistrate was aware that the appellant was a student at the time of sentencing him.
 
Insofar as it may be possible to give some guidance in the matter, on a charge of Defilement under Section 156(1) (a) of the Penal Code (Cap. 17), this Court is firmly of the view that in the absence of aggravating factors and subject to a favourable Social Welfare Officer's report, where the age difference between the accused and the complainant is less than 4 years, a non-custodial sentence is appropriate.
 
In the light of the above and for the foregoing reasons the appeal was allowed and the appellant and his father were ordered to enter into a recognizance of $100 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months and further conditioned that the appellant was not to associate with the complainant.”
 
 [18] In State v Kabaura [2010] FJHC 280; HAC117.2010 (9 August 2010); His Lordship Justice Goundar said:
“The tariff for this offence is from a suspended sentence to four years imprisonment; suspended sentences reserved for virtuous friendship offending while the higher side of the range is for offenders who are older and in position of trust with the victim (Etonia Rokowaqa v. State Criminal Appeal No. HAA37 of 2004); Elia Donumainasuva v. State Criminal Appeal No. HAA032 of 2001).”
 
[19] This tariff was followed by His Lordship Justice Madiagan in State v Raovuna [2011] FJHC 59; HAC 021.2010 (10 February 2011) where he stated: 
 
‘’The facts at trial revealed that in the last week of May 2010, you (the accused) had gone to stay with your uncle at Seaqaqa. While there you came into contact with the victim Katarina and you and she had several meetings over 3 days and you each considered the other to be a romantic friend. On the evening of the 30th May 2010, you and Katarina found yourselves at a house in the settlement where sexual intercourse took place between you. The assessors and the court were obviously of the view that it was consensual.’’
 
 [20] Similarly, in State v Raibevu [2012] FJHC 1040; HAC27.2011 (27 April 2012); His Lordship Justice Madiagan held: 
 
“.....the usual range of sentences (for Defilement) is from a suspended sentence for protagonists in a ""virtuous relationship"" whilst the higher end of the range is for offenders who are older and in a position of trust. (Rokowaqa CA 37/2004, Kabaura HAC 117/2010). In the case of Donumainasuva CA 32/2001, Shameem, J said ""The offence is clearly designed to protect young girls who have entered puberty and experiencing social and hormonal changes, from sexual exploitation.""
 
 [21] In the case of State v Vetaukula [2014] FJHC 500; HAC46.2013 (8 July 2014); the accused, who was the turaga-ni-koro of the village, and who pleaded guilty to the defilement of a 15 year old girl in the same village, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Goundar J said:
 
“The maximum penalty for defilement is 10 years imprisonment. The tariff is between suspended sentences to 4 years imprisonment (Elia Donumainasava v State [2001] HAA 32/01S, 18 May 2001). Suspended sentences are appropriate in cases of non-exploitative relationship between persons of similar age. Custodial sentences are appropriate in cases of sexual exploitation of younger girls by old men or men who hold positions of authority over the girls.”
 
[22] It is the opinion of this Court, that considering the facts of this case, there are no aggravating factors. 
 
[23] Stan, in mitigation you have submitted as follows: 
 
(i) That you are a first offender and that there have been no previous findings of guilt recorded against you to date. The State too confirms this position.
 
(ii) That you fully cooperated with the Police when you were taken in for questioning and subsequently charged instead of trying to circumvent the course of justice. 
 
(iii) You admitted to the offence whilst testifying in Court. Thus, you have acknowledged that what you did was wrong and inexcusable. You have sought forgiveness from this Court and have assured that you will not re-offend. You have submitted that you are gravely remorseful of your actions. 
 
(iv) There has been an unfortunate history of delay prior to this matter being transferred to the High Court and taken up for trial. 
 
[24] Considering all the aforementioned factors, and the restrictions placed on this Court in terms of the provisions of Section 30(3) of the Juveniles Act, I impose on you a punishment of 12 months imprisonment.
 
[25] The next issue for consideration is whether your punishment should be suspended.
 
[26] Section 26 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act provides as follows:
 
(1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances. 
 
(2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence,— 
 
(a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or 
 
(b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrate’s Court. 
 
[27] Stan, you are now 22 years of age. You have admitted that what you did was wrong, and taken full responsibility for your actions. You have also promised that you would lead a crime free life if you are granted a non-custodial punishment. 
 
[28] In Singh & Others v. State [2000] FJHC 115; HAA 79J of 2000S (26 October 2000); Her Ladyship Madam Justice Shameem held: 
 
 “....However as a general rule, leniency is shown to first offenders, young offenders, and offenders who plead guilty and express remorse.....”
 
[29] Her Ladyship Madam Justice Shameem also held In Nariva v. The State [2006] FJHC 6; HAA 148J.2005S (9 February 2006);
 
“The courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment.”
 
[30] I have considered the following circumstances: 
  
• You are a young offender;
 
• You have been of previous good character;
 
• You have fully cooperated with the Police;
 
• You have accepted responsibility for your conduct;
 
• You submit that you are truly remorseful of your actions and have sought forgiveness from this Court;
 
• You have assured Court that you will not re-offend. 
 

Accordingly, it is my opinion that the chances for your rehabilitation is high. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to suspend your punishment. Accordingly, I suspend your punishment for a period of 3 years. The juvenile is advised of the effect of breaching a suspended punishment. 
 
 
[31] In the result, your final punishment would be 12 months imprisonment, which term of imprisonment is suspended for a period of 3 years. 
 
[32] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal if you so wish.

COUNT 9

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154 (1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

TOMASI TIKO BULIVOU some time between the 1st day of January 2009 and 31st December 2009, at Dreketi, Qamea, in the Northern Division, on an occasion other than that alleged in Count 5, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely. L.C, by applying and rubbing the cream from a coconut onto the vagina of the said L. C.

2. When the matter was taken up for trial before assessors on 30th August 2010, you pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and pleaded not guilty to other charge.

3. The trial commenced and continued till 01/09/2010. When you heard and saw both victims, S.C and L.C, mother of S.C, Dr Inose Vatucicila Voce, and the grand mother of L.C were giving evidence.

4. When the case was taken up for further trial on 01/09/2010, you moved for a short adjournment to reconsider your plea. After the adjournment, you informed the Court that you want to plead guilty to other remaining charges also.

5. Accepting your request the amended information was read to you in front of the assessors. You, on your own pleaded guilty to all 9 counts in the charge that (including the counts that you pleaded guilty earlier).

6. You admitted the fact submitted in the trial by the witnesses. After considering your plea of guilty, I am convinced that you have pleaded guilty to all 9 counts in the information without any promise, threat or inducement. After considering your plea is unequivocal, I convicted you on all 9 counts as charged.

7. Now I consider the relevant Law to the 1st count of attempted rape.

Section 151 of the Penal Code:

""Any person who attempts to commit rape is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for ten years, with or without corporal punishment.""

8. You have been charged on 6 counts of rape. The relevant Law is Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code.

149. Any person who has unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, without her consent, or with her consent if the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of bodily harm or by means of false representations to the nature of the act, or in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of the felony termed rape.

150. Any person who commits the offence of rape is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without corporal punishment.

9. Section 207 (1) of the Crime Decree.

""Any person who rapes another person commits an indictable offence.

Penalty – Imprisonment for life.""

10. Section 154(1) of the Penal Code:

""Any person who unlawfully and indecently assaults any woman or girl is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for five years, with or without corporal punishment.""

11. I will now summarize the charges against you.

You have -
One count of Causing Attempted Rape on Siteri Cavunisautu. 

Four counts of Rape on Siteri Cavunisautu under the Penal Code

One count of Rape on Siteri Cavunisautu under the Crimes Decree

One count of Attempted Rape on Lavenia Coganimoto Under Penal Code

One count of Rape on Lavenia Coganimoto under Penal Code

One count of Indecent Assault on Lavenia Coganimoto Penal Code totaling to nine counts.

12. Now I consider the facts of the case, Siteri Cavunisautu is your sister's daughter. When you 1st attempted to rape she was only 5 years old even before she started her schooling. One day in 2005, you took her to a room, removed her clothes, laid her on the bed and spat on her vagina and attempted to insert your penis on her. When she cried, you abandoned the attempt to rape the infant.

13. If the year of 2006, witness claims that you raped the young infant niece for 5 times, but the Director of Public Prosecutions has preferred only one count for 2006.

14. In the year of 2007, you raped her thrice. But you are charged only on one count of Rape.

15. In 2008 you raped her once.

16. You cross examined the witness and she withstood with your questioning and nothing contradicted in her evidence.

17. L.C gave evidence in court. She revealed that she is 9 years old at present and in 2008, you took her to the bed, made her nude and applied salt to vagina and licked her. You attempted to rape her but it failed. Then you tried to insert a handle of a broom stick.

18. In the year 2009, you went to her place and took her to the bed made her nude and brushed her vagina with a hair brush, thereafter you inserted a fork into her vagina. Subsequently, you took a spoon and tapped her vagina.

19. In the same year, you grabbed her from the plantation and made her nude and applied coconut flesh (The white part of the coconut) and raped her.

20. You have threatened the witness that if she tell this to anyone that you will chop her head off.

21. She was subject to your cross examination and maintain her stance.

22. You have raped two small girls for about 4 years.

23. Now I consider that tariff for attempted rape as per Section 151 of the Penal Code provides imprisonment up to 10 years.

24. The tariff for Attempted Rape is 12 months to 5 years imprisonment. (Aunima v The State)[2001]FJHC 105, per Shameem J.

25. In Bulimaiwai ivi The State [2005] FJHC 261; HAA0068J.2005S (2 September 2005), Shameem stated that:

""Sentences at the upper end of the tariff should be imposed where gratuitous violence in inflicted, where a weapon is used. Where there is a gross breach of trust or where there is a large age gap between complainant and offender. In Hari Chand –v- State (supra) I upheld a 3 year term of attempted rape of his daughter-in-law by the offender. There was no gratuitous violence but there was a gross breach of trust.""

26. In Josefa Biu –v- The State HAA085 of 2000, Shameem J upheld the 5 year imprisonment sentence for the attempted rape of an 11 years old child by her uncle.

27. Considering the tariff as per above decide cases, I commence you sentence at 3 years.

28. Aggravating factors which I have discussed under the offence of rape I increase your sentence by 5 years. Now your sentence is 8 years.

29. As I discussed the mitigating circumstances under the offence of rape, I reduce 3 years. Now your sentence is 5 years imprisonment.

30. Punishment for offence of defilement is stated in Section 155 91) of the Penal Code. Imprisonment for life.

31. Now I consider the tariffs.

In Dakai –v- State [2001] FJHC 209; Criminal Appeal 0036.2001 (6 July 2001) Byrne J (as he then was) upheld a sentence of 5 years imposed in the Magistrate's court for the defilement of a girl under 13 years. When Dakai was decided, the maximum penalty for this offence was 5 years. Byrne J considered that the Learned Magistrate did not err in ""imposing the maximum sentence allowed in the Magistrate's Court for the offence.""

32. The age difference also points to the exploitation of a child. The tariff for defilement is from a suspended sentence to 4 years imprisonment. The higher end of the tariff is reserved for older offenders who are in a position of trust with the victim. (See Etoni Rokowaqa –v- State Criminal Appeal No. HAA 37 of 2004; Elia Donimainasuva –v- State Criminal Appeal No.HAA032 of 2001); Domoni –v- State [2009] FJHC 142; HAA089.2008 (10 July 2009).

33. Considering the nature of the offence and your relationship with the victim children, I commence at 3 years imprisonment.

34. Aggravating factors, I have discussed under the offence of rape. Considering the aggravating factors, I increased your sentence by 2 years. Now your sentence is 5 years imprisonment..

35. Mitigating circumstances was discussed under the offences of rape. Considering those circumstances I reduce 2 years. Now your sentence is 3 years imprisonment.

36. Now I consider the offence of indecent assault as per Section 154. You can be imposed on imprisonment up to 5 years.

37. The maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years, though the tariff is 1 – 4 years imprisonment. (Ratu Veretariki Kadavi v The State) Criminal Appeal No. HAA0049 of 2000; Ratu Penioni Rakota –v- State Cri. App. No. HAA0068 of 2002, Bavadra v the State [2003] State v Govind [2010] FJHC 221; HAA013.2010S (30 June 2010).

38. Considering the relationship between you and the victim and the age I commence your sentence at 3 years.

39. Aggravating factors are discussed under the offence of rape. Considering those factors, I increase your sentence by 2 years. Now your sentence is 5 years.

40. Considering your mitigating circumstance which was considered under the offence of rape, I reduce 2 years. Now your sentence is 3 years.

41. Now I consider the offence of rape. Section 150 of the Penal Code says life imprisonment can be imposed.

42. Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree provides life imprisonment for the offence of rape.

43. Now I consider the tariff to the offence of Rape.

In the case of State v Cakau FJHC 141; HAC010.2010 (24 April) Fernando J highlighted the cases where Shameem J laid down the starting point for the rape of children and also the case of Drotini v The State (2006) FJCA 26; AAU0001.2005S (24 March 2006) where the FCA had confirmed the sentence of rape to 11 years. In State v Cakau the accused was sentenced to 11 years.

In the case of State v Simione Talenasila has the exact same facts and circumstances of this case where the accused indecently assaulted and raped his daughter. The matter was transferred up for sentencing and the accused after all considerations was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment.

In State –v- Prabhu Lal [2007] HAC 3/05B Sentence 24 May 2007 per Shameem J; on one count of indecent assault and two of rape, rape of then 9 year old daughter on 2 occasions over 3 years, instead of giving her love and protection, father made her a target of his lustful desires causing her not only physical pain but unimaginable mental trauma, violated her, and broke all the rules not only of a father daughter relationship but of civilised human society. The facts case merited a sentence of more than 11 years but it is not so manifestly lenient that warrants interference by the Court.

44. You were the maternal uncle to one child that mean, the victim is your sister's daughter. To the other victim, you are a grand uncle. Considering all circumstances, I commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment.

45. Now I consider the aggravating factors.

a) You are a close relative of both victims.

b) You betrayed the bondage between uncle and niece.

c) Victims were infants aged 5 years at the time of 1st incident.

d) You have committed these offences repeatedly for a period of time.

e) You have ruined the child victim's future of these two.

f) You have threatened the child victim with death.

g) The cruel manner you committed the offence.

Considering all aggravating factors, I increase 7 years. Now your sentence is 18 years imprisonment.

46. Now I proceed to consider your mitigating circumstances.

1) For two counts you have pleaded guilty at the beginning. Pleaded guilty to the other counts subsequently.

2) You are married with 3 children.

3) You are remorseful.

4) Period in remand.

Considering your mitigating circumstances, I reduce 2 years. Now your senesce is 16 years imprisonment. 

47. Now I summarize the sentence.

Count No. 1 
Attempted Rape
5 years imprisonment
Count No. 2
Rape 

Count No. 3 
Rape
16 years imprisonment
Count No. 4
Rape
16 years imprisonment
Count No. 5
Defilement
5 years imprisonment
Count No. 6
Rape
16 years imprisonment

These above offence were committed on your niece. Considering your plea, even at later stage, I order the sentence to be operated concurrently.

48. 

Count No. 7 
Attempted Rape
5 years imprisonment
Count No. 8 
Rape
16 years imprisonment
Count No. 9
Indecent Assault
3 years imprisonment

There above offence were committed on another very young child. Considering your plea and all the circumstances, I order the sentence to be operated concurrently.

49. Now you have two 16 years imprisonment sentences. Considering the gravity of the offence especially the children were nearly 5 years old when you commenced these sexual offences against them. Therefore I order part of the sentence to run concurrent and the other part to run consecutive.

50. Your second sentence of 16 years imprisonment will operate from 4th year of the 1st sentence. You will serve a total of 20 years imprisonment.

51. Considering the future of these children and others in your society, I invite myself the attention of Section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and impose 16 years as non parole term.

52. 30 days to appeal.

53. Name and identity of the victims are suppressed due to the suppressing order issued by me on the request of the State Counsel.

51,698,78942,"RULING

The appellant in this matter was convicted and sentenced at the Nadi Magistrates Court on the 17th February 2004 with respect to a charge of Indecent Assault and a further charge of Wrongful Confinement.

Particulars of the offences are: 

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

AFZAL KHAN s/o Shamsher Khan on the 29th day of November 2002 at Nadi, in the Western Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted a girl namely SELAI SINUKULA.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

WRONGFUL CONFINEMENT: Contrary to section 256 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence

AFZAL KHAN s/o Shamsher Khan on the 29th day of November 2002 at Nadi, in the Western Division, wrongfully confined a girl namely SELAI SINUKULA.

The facts as they appear from the record of the Magistrates Court were that the appellant was employed at the complainant’s school. That the complainant got into the appellant’s motor vehicle and that he took her ultimately to Wailoaloa Beach without her permission instead of taking her to her home. That at the beach the appellant kissed her on the lips once and touched her thighs. That he put her dress up and stated that she looked beautiful. At the time of the commission of the offences, the complainant was a class 3 student and 10 years of age.

There is no suggestion in the facts as found by the Learned Magistrate that there was any touching on the genitals or any penetration. The medical report tendered before the Learned Magistrate confirms that there was in fact no apparent penetration or physical injury to the complainant.

The Learned Magistrate sentenced the appellant to a period of 2 years imprisonment with respect to the indecent assault and 12 months imprisonment with respect to the wrongful confinement and then ordered that the sentences be served consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

The appellant appeals to this court against the sentences imposed upon him. The tariff for the offence of indecent assault was considered by Madam Justice Shameem in Josateki Seru v The State – Criminal Appeal No. HAA0050 of 2003S. Her Ladyship reiterated what she said to Penioni Ratoto v The State in Criminal Appeal No. HAA0068 of 2002S, the principles there set out are:

“Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was use, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflect on the gravity of the offence. Mitigating factors might be the previous good character of the accused, honest attempts to effect apology and reparation to the victim, and a prompt plea of guilty, which saves the victim the trauma of giving evidence.

These are the general principles which affect sentencing under section 154 of the Penal Code. Generally, the sentence will fall within the tariff although in particularly serious cases, a five year sentence may be appropriate.

A non-custodial sentence will only be appropriate in cases where the ages of the victim and the accused are similar, and the assault of a non-penetrative and fleeting type. Because of the vast differences in different types of indecent assault, it is difficult to refer to any more specific guideline than these.”

As I have already indicated the facts as found by the Learned Magistrate made it clear that there was indeed no penetration in the assault affected by the appellant nor was there any violence or weapons of any type used. The victim however is a child of 10 years of age and this in itself is an aggravation.

The appellant was entitled to no discount before the Learned Magistrate for entering a plea of guilty as the matter proceeded by way of defended hearing and of course he is not to be the subject of any additional penalty because he chose to defend the matter.

It would appear that the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years is within the range and certainly is not manifestly excessive or wrong at law, such as to warrant this court interfering with it. Similarly, the sentence of 12 months imposed with respect with the wrongful confinement is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle such as with warrant this court interfering with it.

The Learned Magistrate did however order that the sentences be served consecutively.

The facts as found by the Learned Magistrate clearly indicate that both offences were committed at the same time and that it was all part of the one event. In these circumstances, the sentencing guidelines are clear that sentences for offences, which are all part of the one incident, should be served concurrently and accordingly, the Order of the Court will be:

1. Appeal is allowed.

2. Sentence of the Learned Magistrate with respect to the charge of indecent assault of 2 years imprisonment is confirmed.

3. Sentence of the Learned Magistrate with respect to wrongful confinement of 12 months is confirmed.

4. Both sentences to be served concurrently.

52,699,256798,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused has been convicted of two counts of rape of his 10 year old niece in the year 2014 in Savusavu.
 
 
[2] The facts were that the accused had a house in the village in which he lived alone. 
 
 
[3] On the first occasion he called Mere (not her real name) into the house. The two of them were inside alone. He placed her against a wall, removed her trousers and invaded her with a finger.
 
 
[4] On the second occasion when he called her in he was lying on the bed. He gave her some money and then told her to lie down on the floor. He removed her clothes and his clothes, lay on top of her and started moving up and down. Mere said it was causing pain in her vagina because he was “putting it in”. 
 
 
[5] She said that there were several occasions that he did this and on each occasion he would give her money to buy sweets and gum. 
 
 
[6] The incidents came to light when an Aunt noticed that she had unexplained sums of money and observations and persistent enquiry of Mere revealed the relationship. 
 
 
Mitigation
 
 
[7] In written submissions in mitigation, Counsel pleads for mercy. The accused is 49 years old and separatedfrom his wife for 17 years.He has one son who lives in Suva. At the relevant time he was a farmer within the village 
 
 
[8] He is a first offender and is said to be very remorseful. The Court has noticed that remorse throughout his trial. 
 
 
[9] He has spent 17 months on remand whilst awaiting trial. The maximumpenaltyfor rape is life imprisonment and the Supreme Court has said that sentences for rape of minors should be a term of imprisonment of between 10 and 16 years. (AnandAbhayRajCAV003/2014).
 
 
[10] In following that case I take a starting point of 10 years.
 
 
Aggravation
 
 
[11] The abuse of a niece by her uncle is a serious breach of trust and the 37 years age difference makes it very much worse.
 
 
[12] The victim wasa very shy and impressionable 10 year old at the time and these assaults would almost certainly scar her own development to sexual maturity. As this Court said in Mario Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216:
 
 
 “Our nation’s children must be protected and they must be allowed
 
to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound”.
 
 
[13] A further aggravating feature in this case is that the accused enticed the girl with small gifts of money and sweets.
 
 
[14] For these aggravating features I add six years to the starting point bringing the sentence up to a term of 16 years. 
 
 
[15] For his clear recordandobvious remorse I deduct two years bringing the sentence down to 14 years.
 
 
[16] I deduct the 17 months he has spent in remand awaiting trial and the final sentence that this Court imposes for rape is twelve years and five months.
 
 
[17] That is the sentence to be imposed for each of the two counts of rape. These terms will be served concurrently and he will serve a minimum term of 9 years and 6 months before being eligible for parole.

1. The Accused above named is convicted for three counts of Rape, punishable under section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009.

2. The Accused had raped his own niece (elder brother's daughter) who was 16 years old.

Law

3. Section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree prescribes imprisonment for life as maximum sentence for the offence of Rape.

Tariff

4. Tariff for the offence of Rape was discussed in many cases it ranges from 10 to 16 years imprisonment.

5. In William Christopher Millbery & 2 Others vs. R (2002) EWCA Crim. 2891 (09 December 2002) the Court held:

""22. The Panel confirms the 15 years and upwards starting point for a campaign of rape. This is recommended where the offender has repeatedly raped the same victim over a course of time as well as for those involving multiple victims.""

6. In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994 the Court of Appeal observed (at p.6):

""We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""

7. In State v Lasaro Turagabeci [1996] FJHC 173; HAC 0008.1996S (27 November 1996) Pain J. said:

""The Courts made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.""

8. In a case with some similarities to this case Shameem J in The State v Navauniani Koroi (unreported) Cr. App. Case No. HAA0050.2002S arrived at a sentence of 12 years and explained:

""Taking the 7 years as the starting point, I increase the term by two years for the young age of the complainant, and a further three years for the fact that she is your daughter. I add a further year for the resulting pregnancy. I reduce the term by one year for the guilty plea and other mitigation ....""

9. In The State v Peniasi Senikarawa (unreported) High Court Suva Cr. Case HAC 0017.2008S; 20 May 2003 the accused was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. Shameem J started on the tariff at 7 years. The mitigation was that the accused had a good character, was hardworking and struggling to raise his son single handed. But for being in breach of his position of trust to his 14 year old step-daughter, for the beatings he gave her, and for the fact that she had to give evidence twice, the court imposed a further 4 years.

""The Courts made it clear that rapists will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences to the victim are likely to be severe. The Courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentences.""

10. In Inoke Buli v The State (unreported) Court of Appeal, Fiji Cr. App. No. AAU0003.00S; 24 May 2011 the Court of Appeal approved a sentence of 12 years on an accused for rape of his mentally retarded step-daughter. There was both breach of trust and the accused had a prior conviction for rape as aggravating factors. The force however appeared to be minimal.

11. State v Talenasila Criminal Case No. HAC 11 of 2010 – The Court held that rape and indecent assault are abominable and are becoming too common in Fiji. The authorities state that rape of children must incur a starting point of 10 years. The accused was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for the count of rape and 4 years imprisonment for each count of indecent assault. The sentences for the two counts of indecent assault were to be served concurrently but pursuant to Section 17 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, the 2 years of those sentences was to be served consecutively to the rape sentence. The total period of imprisonment therefore was a term of 16 years imprisonment.

12. State v Sailosi Selebula (2010) HAC 148 of 2010 – The Court held that a single count of rape should properly reflect the complete abhorrence that members of the public feel towards adults who abuse young children in their case. The Court stated that a sentence in the region of 10 years would be appropriate. The accused was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment reduced to 14 years for good character. A non-parole period of 11 years was imposed.

13. In R v M [1988] VSCA 68 (7 October 1998) the Supreme Court of Victoria – Court of Appeal held for the count of oral rape that the accused be sentenced to 6 years. We wish to draw attention to the fact here that the complainant was an adult and also the accused had been charged for other offences in this case. But the seriousness of the count of oral rape still reflects the sentence given and in the case before the Court this involves a child.

14. Further the Court observed in Millbery v R (supra):

""60 .... we note that the Court's prior to the guideline were regarding relationship rape as serious and deserving heavy sentence.""

15. In the case of State v Tauvoli [2011] FJHC 216; HAC 027.2011 (18 April 2011) the Court in this case stated that:

""Rape of children is a very serious offence indeed and it seems to ber very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation has dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect societies abhorrence for such crimes. Our nations children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""

16. The victim impact report was filed in Court unveils following factors:

a) The victim continually experiencing discharge from her vagina;
b) She is emotionally upset and very often getting flashback of what happened to her;
c) Most of the time she is withdrawn and not trusting any men;
d) She is differently treated by her family and friends;
e) She had estranged her relationship with parents and relatives.

17. Considering the above factors I commence your sentence at 14 years imprisonment.

18. Aggravating factors:

a) Victim is your niece and you betrayed the bond and trust between uncle and niece;
b) You made 16 year old young girl sexually active;
c) You made the young girl to feel useless and frustrated;
d) You continually abused her;
e) You are not remorseful in fact while you are giving evidence you took pride of having sex with your niece.

Considering the above aggravating factors I increase your sentence by 5 years. Now your sentence is 19 years.

19. Mitigating circumstances:

a) Looking after your elderly parents;
b) Period spent in remand custody;
c) Married with two children;
d) Sole breadwinner.

20. Considering all above mitigating circumstances I reduce your sentence by 4 years. Now your sentence is 15 years imprisonment.

21. You have admitted you have 10 previous convictions out of which 6 are within the operational period. Your previous convictions were not considered as aggravating factors. Your Counsel claims that you have no previous convictions on sexual offences. Anyhow I am unable to grant you any discount because some of the offences are very serious.

22. According to 18 (1) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree I impose 11 years as non-parole period. You will not be eligible for any parole until you complete 11 years in custody.
You are sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with 11 years as non-parole period.

23. Under the Domestic Violence Decree I declare the victim as Protected Person and you are issued with following domestic violence restraining order.

""You should not:

a) Physically assault or sexually abuse the protected person;
b) Threaten to physically assault or sexually abuse the protected person;
c) Damage or threaten to damage any property of the protected person;
d) Threaten, intimidate, or harass the protected person;

54,701,79013,"RULING

[1] Niko Vila (the appellant) was tried and convicted of digital rape of a 6-year old girl in the High Court at Lautoka. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment with 12 years as non-parole. 

[2] This is an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence pursuant to section 21(1) of the Court of Appeal Act. The test for leave is whether the ground of appeal is arguable before the Full Court.

Conviction appeal
[3] The ground of appeal against conviction is as follows:

""The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to overturn the majority guilty opinion of the assessors when the evidence of the complainant did not confirm the element of penetration.""

[4] Sufficiency of evidence on an element of the charged offence involves consideration of facts. The appellant contends that there was no evidence of penetration from the victim in this case.

[5] The victim's evidence was summarized at paragraph 29 of the summing up. At the time the victim gave evidence, she was 8 years old. The victim's evidence was when the appellant touched her vio (meaning vagina) she felt pain. The victim was medically examined two days after the alleged incident. Upon examination of the victim's genitalia, the doctor observed redness on the vaginal area and vagina hymen was not visible. The doctor's opinion was that the perforated hymen meant that the hymen had been penetrated. In cross-examination the doctor could not tell how old the perforation of the hymen was. The trial judge at paragraph 43 of his summing up told the assessors to consider the issue of penetration in light of the medical evidence. At paragraph 46 of the summing up, the trial judge directed the assessors that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did put his fingers into the vagina of AV for him to be guilty of rape.

[6] Whether there was penetration of the victim's vagina was a question of fact. I accept that the victim said in her evidence that the appellant touched her vagina after taking her underwear off. She did not use the word penetration in her evidence. In considering whether there was penetration, the assessors were entitled to take into account the victim's evidence and the confirmatory medical evidence. When considered together it was open to the assessors to conclude that there was penetration of the victim's vagina.

[7] The ground of appeal against conviction is not arguable and the conviction appeal cannot possibly succeed.

Sentence appeal
[8] The grounds of appeal against sentence are:

""The learned trial Judge erred in law when he imposed a non-parole period when the imposition of the non-parole offended against the remission as allowed in the Prisons and Corrections Act 2006.

The Learned Trial Judge failed to discount the period the Appellant was in remand.

The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not accepting mitigation proffered by the Appellant whilst sentencing the Appellant.

The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact when he treated the Appellant's case theory as an Aggravating feature whilst sentencing.""

Non parole remission
[9] Remission is an irrelevant consideration in sentencing and is a matter that should not
affect the sentencing discretion of the judge. This ground is not arguable. 

Remand period
[10] The appellant submits his remand period of 2 months was not taken into account in the sentence. The State concedes this ground is arguable.

Mitigating factors
[11] The appellant made no submission on this ground. In any event, the trial judge made a downward adjustment of 2 years to the sentence for the mitigating factors.

Aggravating factors
[12] The learned judge picked 14 years as a starting point to reflect the tender age of the victim. He then added two years to reflect the aggravating factors identified at paragraphs 12 – 15 of his sentencing remarks as follows: 

""The victim in this case was only six years of age at the time of the incident. She was just stepping into her formative ages and moving around playing even around the time of the incident. The accused, who was 66 years old, had three sons – all above 39 years of age – and nine grandchildren.

The accused, in the circumstances, either knew or ought to have known the value of children; and, that they needed protection and shelter from adults. Despite that, the accused raped the little granddaughter to satisfy his unnatural lust occasioning a serious breach of trust and morality.

The conduct of the accused was a calculated one as he took advantage of child-gullibility and practiced a trick on the victim to lure her to his house by showing some beans in order to engage in the unlawful sexual act.

The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl in the calibre of AV is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and assess even by psychologists or sociologist. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in a case of this nature, deterrence is, therefore, of paramount importance"".

[13] It is clear that the learned judge used the serious breach of trust and the fact that the appellant exploited the victim's vulnerability as a child as aggravating factors to increase the sentence. There is no arguable error in the manner in which the learned judge dealt with the aggravating factors.

Result

[14] Leave to appeal against conviction is refused.

[15] Leave to appeal against sentence allowed on ground 2 only.

55,702,82203,"SENTENCE

[1] The accused was found guilty of and convicted of rape in this court, following a trial lasting two days before three assessors. He had pleaded not guilty to the charge. The charge was a representative charge and alleged that Bijendra (also known as Manoj) had raped one (name suppressed) at Nasinu on the 28th November 2010. In fact the State ran the case of the basis that the victim had been raped several times in the early hours of the 28th November 2010 but he has been convicted of one count and will be sentenced for one count.

[2] The disturbing facts of the case are that the victim who we shall call Ms P., being 24 years of age at the time, had been suffering from rather serious acne. She had sought medical treatment for the condition but to no avail. The aunt with whom she was living suggested she consult a neighbour known to have witchcraft powers to heal. They did in fact consult the neighbour who is the accused. In two preliminary meetings the accused performed a rudimentary sevusevu ceremony and claimed to have invoked the spirit of his family god. He was also able to impress Ms P. with details of her personal life (which he had presumably got at an earlier time from the aunty.) The accused claimed to have discerned that Ms P. had greater problems than acne and she could only be cured by going through the ""process."" The ""process"" was not explained to Ms P. but only discussed between her aunt and the accused.

[3] On the afternoon of 27th November 2010, the accused came to the house of Ms P. and her aunt with paraphernalia to do the ""process."" By this stage Ms P. had learned that the process involved sexual intercourse and she was shocked. She argued with her aunt and said she didn't want to do it. In the evening of the 27th the accused prepared and drank a lot of yaqona, smoked cigarettes and claimed to have invoked the spirits of two gods. He impressed upon Ms P. that sex was her cure and without it she and her family would perish.

[4] At about 1am on the 28th November, Ms P. was pushed into her bedroom with the accused – the door was locked and the aunt turned the T.V. on with full volume. The accused stripped Ms P. and stripped himself and after kissing her all over forced her to perform a sexual act on him. After that he raped her. By Ms P's account he raped her 5 times throughout the night, but the accused told the court that it was 3 times.

[5] At 7.30am he left saying that the first process was complete. Ms P. slept all day and the following day after making complaint to her employer, a report was made to the Police and she was medically examined.

[6] The medical examination revealed evidence of bruising and bleeding in her genitalia which was indicative of sexual abuse.

[7] The accused gave evidence and claimed vehemently that Ms P. consented to the 3 sexual acts on the 28th November, in the belief that she would be cured of her acne and of other ailments. He showed no remorse for his deeds whatsoever and appeared to the Court to enjoy telling of his invocation of spirits and his manipulation of the victim.

Mitigation

[8] Counsel for the accused tells me that his client is 39 years old and married with 3 children who are all schooling. He rents the family home at Nakasi for $180 per month and sells vegetables to raise money to pay the rent and support his family. He has no previous record.

[9] Most of his relatives are in Vanua Levu and there is nobody in Viti Levu to care for his family if he is imprisoned. Counsel for the accused on that basis makes the totally unrealistic application that this Court in defiance of all authority pass a non-custodial sentence. He claims to be remorseful, although the Court has seen no evidence of that throughout the trial. He asks me to consider the fact that there was no serious violence used on the victim, a submission that is not borne out by the evidence which disclosed bruising and contusions. The lack of serious violence is more than countered by the deception practiced in the affair.

[10] State counsel asks the Court to consider the breach of trust occasioned to the victim and the degree of planning that went into the deception. He submits a Victim Impact Report which discloses the still present insecurity and shame being experienced by the victim as well as her inability to relate socially to others.

The Law

[11] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and the minimum term for rape of an adult (which Ms P. indeed was) is seven years' imprisonment (Mohammed Kasim CA 14/93).

[12] The sentence will of course be enhanced should there be aggravating features present at the time of the rape charged.

[13] The State, in making the charge a representative count, alleges that there were five acts of rape on November 28th, 2010; the accused claims that there were but three. Giving the accused the benefit of that dispute, the Court will take the additional two acts as aggravating to the charge.

[14] Further aggravation comes from the lack of remorse of the accused evidenced throughout the trial, but the greatest aggravating feature is the accused's use of subterfuge and deceit in his ploys to have sex with Ms P. He knew that he wasn't able to cure her acne in this manner but he manipulated both Ms P. and her aunt in his plan to ""process"" Ms P. or to seduce her.

[15] In a similar case before this Court earlier this year (Abdul Rasheed HAC107 of 2011), a sentence of 13 years was passed on the accused.

[16] I take a starting point for this one rape of eight years and to reflect the lack of remorse and the humiliation of additional acts of rape I add three years to that total making an interim total of eleven years. For the subterfuge, deceit and misrepresentation of the meaning of the act I add yet another 4 years bringing the total sentence to 15 years imprisonment.

[17] For the limited mitigation available to the accused which is represented by his family circumstances and his hitherto clear record, I reduce the sentence by 2 years meaning that the accused will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 13 years. He will serve a minimum term of 11 years before being eligible for parole.

56,703,79245,"SENTENCE

	1.	MAIKA TUTUVAKATABUA, you were charged with Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm contrary to s.275 of the Crimes Decree. 

	2.	When the charge was read to you on 15/10/2012, you waived right to legal counsel and pleaded guilty for the charge. 

	3.	Summary of facts reveled that on 15/07/2012 you came home drunk and asked your mother about food. Then you got angry and when the victim (your father) tried to stop you assaulted the victim causing injuries. You admitted the facts when it was read to you.

	4.	This court is satisfied that you pleaded guilty without any threat or inducement and therefore convicts you for the offence. 

The Law and Tariff for Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm.

	1.	The maximum penalty for this offence is 05 years imprisonment. 

	2.	Tariff for this offence is from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. In State v Tugalala [[2008] FJHC 78; HAC025S.2008S (29 April 2008). 

	3.	Upon considering the summary of facts in this case I select 06 months imprisonment as the starting point for your sentence. 

8 The victim is your father. He was 57 years old. This offence comes under the definition of domestic violence. Also you assaulted the victim without any provocation. At that time you were drunk. All these will be considered as aggravating factors and I add 03 months to your sentence to reach 09 months. 

	1.	You were given a chance to mitigate and you submitted the following points.
	I.	25 years old
	II.	Single 
	III.	Seeks forgiveness 

	2.	Since you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity this court reduced your sentence by 1/3 to reach 06 months (Akili Vilimone v State).

	3.	For other mitigating factors I reduce further 02 month to reach the period of 04 months imprisonment. You have previous convictions and therefore would not get any discounts for your past behavior. 

	4.	Now your final sentence is 04 months. I am mindful of the fact that this court can suspend a sentence which is below 02 years. 

	5.	You admitted the list of previous convictions tendered by the prosecution. From that I note that you got 13 convictions. I also note that this court has given you a suspended sentence in C.F. 178/2008 on 26/03/2012 for 03 years. And according to summary of facts this offence was committed on 15/07/2012, the operational period of that suspended sentence. 

	6.	The main purposes of giving a suspended sentence are to keep offenders out of prison whilst giving them a chance to reform.

	7.	By reoffending within 04 months of the suspended sentence you demonstrated that you did not learn from the mistakes nor wanted to reform. Therefore this court does not see any reason for giving you a second chance. 

	8.	Accordingly you are sentenced to 04 months imprisonment for committing this offence. 

	9.	Also this court issues a permanent domestic violence restraining order with standard non molestation conditions in favor of the victim under s.24 (1) (b) of the Domestic Violence Decree 2009. 

	10.	The police is ordered to take necessary steps against the accused for breaching the suspended sentence in C.F. 178/2008. 

	11.	28 days to appeal

	1.	The appellant was charged before the Tavua Magistrate under the following count:

Statement of Offence

ASSAULT CAUSING ACTUAL BODILY HARM:- Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

	2.	The facts of the case are on 14th April 2013 at home, the victim was asking her child to do some house work which was not liked by the victim's mother in law. Victim had told mother in law not to interfere as she wants her daughter to learn. There was heated argument between victim and the mother in law. The appellant who is the husband of the victim asked the victim why she was rude to his mother. Then appellant held the victim by neck and pushed her out side.

	3.	This appeal was filed on 9th July 2013 within time.

	4.	The grounds of appeal are:

Appeal against the conviction:

(a) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in convicting the Appellant when he failed to consider all aspects and/or all relevant matters of mitigation into account.
		(i) Failing to consider the fact that the complainant had written a letter withdrawing the complaint;

		(ii) Failing to consider the emails attached to the typed mitigation submitted to the Court;

		(iii) Failing to consider the effect of conviction on the well being of the family and the likely effect on the marriage between the parties;

		(iv) Failing to consider the continued support by the accused of his family despite the affair of his wife with another man and the reasons why he had lost his job with Big Rooster.


(b) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in concluding that there was no provocation in the matter particularly in view of the emails attached to the mitigation.

(c) That learned Trial Magistrate's decision in entering a conviction was manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in principal and in the exercise of his discretion in all the circumstances of the case.

(d) That the learned Trial Magistrate's application and/or interpretation of the case of State v David Batiratu Revision Case No. HAR 001/2012 is with respect incorrect particularly also in view of considering Section 9 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

(e) That the learned Trial Magistrate failed to exercise his discretion under Section 15,16, and 45 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, which discretion he has under the said provisions.

(f) That the appellant reserves his right to add to the above grounds of appeal upon receipt of the Court records in this matter.
Appeal against the sentence

(a) That the appellant appeal against the sentence being manifestly harsh and excessive and wrong in principal in all the circumstances of the case.

(b) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the appellant and also not taking into relevant considerations.
		(i) Failing to consider the fact the complainant had written a letter withdrawing the complaint;

(ii) Failing to consider the emails attached to the typed mitigation;

(iii) Failing to consider the effect of conviction on the well being of the family and the likely effect on the marriage between the parties;

(iv) Failing to consider the continued support by the accused of his family despite the affair of his wife with another man and the reasons why he had lost his job with Big Rooster.

(c) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in considering the prevalence of offence as aggravating factor.

(d) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact when considering the lack of provocation and aggravating factor when clearly pursuant to the emails attached to the mitigation there was provocation.

(e) That the learned Trial Magistrate's application and/or interpretation of the case of State v David Batiratu Revision Case No. HAR 001/2012 is with respect incorrect particularly also in view of considering Section 9 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

(f) That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 and in particular Sections 4,5,9,15,16 and 45 when sentencing the appellant.
Appeal against the conviction:

	1.	The appellant had pleaded guilty to the count against him and admitted the summary of facts on 24.6.2013.

	2.	In the written submissions of mitigation filed by the appellant before the learned Magistrate he had prayed for dismissal of the charge without recording a conviction acting under Sections 15(1) (j), 16 (1) and 45 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree on the basis that such conviction will jeopardize his prospects of employment. 

	3.	The learned Magistrate had considered the question whether it would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case to enter a no conviction against the appellant and to discharge him.

	4.	He had considered the judgment of State v Kumar [2001] FJHC 101; HAA 0014.2001l(2 February 2001), where it was held that:

""The Court in its sentencing remarks said rightly, it was faced with a very awkward situation for this accused was facing dismissal from his employment if a conviction were to be entered. Nevertheless a discharge without conviction being entered was not an appropriate sentence here. Absolute discharges are appropriate only in limited number of circumstances, such as where no moral blame attaches(R v O'Toole (1971) 55 Cr App p 206) or where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred, perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty (R v Kavanagh (unreported) May 16th 1972 CA)""

	1.	Further the case of State v David Batiratu Revisional Case No. HAR001/2012 was also considered by the learned Magistrate. It was held in that case by the Hon. Chief Justice that:

""The effect of the cases and the purport of the more detailed provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree with regard to discharges can be summarized. If a discharge without conviction is urged upon the Court the sentencer must consider the following question, whether:

(a) The offender is morally blameless.
(b) Whether only a technical breach in the law has occurred.
(c) Whether the offence is of a trivial and minor nature.
(d) Whether the public interest in the enforcement and effectiveness of the legislation is such that escape from penalty is not consistent with that interest.
(e) Whether circumstances exist in which it is appropriate to record a conviction, or merely to impose nominal punishment.
(f) Are there any other extenuating or exceptional circumstances, a rare situation, justifying a court showing mercy to an offender.""
	1.	The learned Magistrate then stated that:

""When considering the above questions, the offender in this case cannot be said to be morally blameless. The offending was deliberate and there's no technical breach of the law. In addition as noted earlier the nature of the offending in this case is serious and not trivial. It is domestic violence offence and due to its seriousness it is no longer a reconcilable offence. In the public interest and to ensure that enforcement of the law is effective, a punishment is warranted due to seriousness of the charge. There are no exceptional circumstances in this case that justify no conviction to be entered and offender to be discharged. Therefore in exercising my discretion a conviction will have to be entered and as it would be wrong in principle to discharge you without conviction.""

	1.	I totally agree with the observations of the learned Magistrate in the back ground of the cited authorities. 

	2.	Further in State v Kumar [2001] FJHC 340;[2001] 2FLR 225 (25 July 2001) it was held by His Lordship Anthony Gates that:

""The respondent, prior to the sentence, has suffered in various ways. The case went through many adjournments in the Magistrates' Court. For nearly 3 years he suffered interdiction without pay. This had the equivalent effect of a substantial time. His wife had earlier left him. He was trying to look after the two children, to whom he had to act as mother and father. I had been informed that he was to pay $100 to the complainant as compensation, which compensation the victim has now confirmed has been paid. Upon the basis that a punishment, if it were to result in the loss of the respondent's livelihood with the police, would be disproportionate to the crime committed, I ordered that the Respondent be discharged absolute without conviction entered. This cannot be a precedent however for the imposition of absolute discharges in cases of this sort.""

	1.	It was cited in approval the reasoning of Richard J in Fisheries Inspector v Turner[1978] 2 NZLR 233 at p241 who described the extend of the sentencing discretion for a section not very different from section 44 of the Fiji's Penal Code:

""In considering the exercise of the discretion under s42 the Court is required to balance all the relevant public interest considerations that apply in the particular case; or; as s42 (1) puts it, 'after inquiry into the circumstances of the case', which must refer to all circumstances that are relevant in the particular case before the Court. It must have due regard to the nature of the offence and the gravity with which it is viewed by Parliament; to the seriousness of the particular offending; to the circumstances of the particular offender in terms of the effect on his career, his pocket, his reputation and any civil disabilities consequential on conviction; and to any other relevant circumstances. And if the direct and indirect consequences of a conviction are in Court's judgment, out of all proportion to the gravity of the offence, it is proper for the a discharge to be given under s42.""

	1.	The appellant by his counsel had submitted that the learned Magistrate should have taken Section 16(1) (c) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree into consideration and not order a conviction to be entered. He submits that as he is a first offender and there is reconciliation it is a suitable case for not recording a conviction. 

	2.	Section 16 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree reads as follows:

""Section 16 (1) In exercising his discretion whether or not record a conviction, a Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including-..............

(a) The nature of the offence;
(b) The character and past history of the offender; and
(c) The impact of a conviction on the offender's economic or social well-being, and on his or her employment prospects.""
	1.	The operative word in this section is ""discretion"". Where the Magistrate had exercised his discretion within the bounds of his power that it would be in very exceptional circumstances that an appellate Court would interfere with that exercise.

	2.	This is particularly so in cases of Domestic Violence which this case is. The Domestic Violence Decree is clearly a Decree to provide greater protection from Domestic Violence and it would not be in the spirit of this legislation to not to record a conviction against a perpetrator. 

	3.	Further according to Section 154 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Decree promotion of reconciliation is not applicable to offences of Domestic Violence, as defined by the Domestic Violence Decree, 2009.

	4.	The appellant had pleaded guilty to the offence and had admitted the summary of facts which go to the elements of the offence. The learned Magistrate had exercised his discretion correctly.
Thus there is merit in the grounds against the conviction and those fails. 

	1.	The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.

Appeal against the sentence

	1.	The learned Magistrate had taken a starting point of 9 months. For aggravating factors namely the prevalence of the offence in community and lack of provocation he had added 2 months. This being the first offence and other mitigating factors 2 months was reduced. Further 3 months were reduced for the guilty plea arriving at a sentence of 6 months. 

	2.	Then the learned Magistrate had considered the suspension of the sentence. He had stated that 'Although the nature of the offending was unprovoked, this is your first offence and you need to be given opportunity to reform yourself. Therefore I am going to suspend your sentence.'

	3.	The sentence of 6 months imprisonment was suspended for 2 years. Further he had made permanent the interim restraining orders made under Section 27 (2) of the Domestic Violence Decree on 18th April 2013.

	4.	The learned Magistrate had followed the following tariff judgments.

State v Salote Tugalala HAC 25 of 2008
Elizabeth Joseph v The state [2004] HAA 030.2004S
State v Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA 073 .2004S
Amasi Korovata v The State [2006] HAA 115.2006S

According to these judgments the tariff for the offence of Common Assault and Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment. In State v Tevita Alafi [2004] HAA 073 .2004S it is stated that it is the extent of the injury which determines sentence........ Where there has been a deliberate assault, causing hospitalization and with no reconciliation, a discharge is not appropriate. In domestic violence cases sentence of 18 months imprisonment have been upheld. (Amasi Korovata v The State [2006] HAA 115.2006S)

	1.	In Raisoqoni v State [2011] FJHC 32; HAA 004.2011 (7 February 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Daniel Gounder held that:

'The Domestic Violence Decree has changed the old law. Under the new law, domestic violence offences are not reconcilable and therefore there is no discretion given to the courts to encourage reconciliation. However, if the victim freely reconciles with the partner and gives evidence of that effect, reconciliation is a factor that ought to be taken into account in sentencing the offender........The term of six months imprisonment was within the tariff and was arrived at after all relevant factors were taken into account.'

	1.	In State v Kumar [2011] FJHC 341; HAA 020.2010(9 June 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'A domestic violence offence which this obviously is cannot be reconciled and in any event the Court record notes that the victim did not want to reconcile. It is incumbent upon the tribunal or officer of the Court to have regard to the Domestic Violence Decree which came into force on the 1st of December 2009. The Decree was enacted to protect persons, men women and children, from abuse in domestic environment and if the Courts do not make findings and rulings within the spirit of the Decree, then that altruistic arm is thwarted.'

Setting aside a penalty of $100 compensation, a term of 6 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years was ordered in this case.

	1.	In Chand v State [2011] FJHC 593; HAA 024.2011 (23 September 2011) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'Assaults in a domestic context are particularly odious in that wives, and husband for that matter, should feel safe in their homes without having their trust I their loved ones betrayed. The learned Magistrate was quite correct in finding that the domestic element to this offending was an aggravating feature.'

	1.	In Botaki v State [2012] FJHC 1250; HAA 015.2012 (1 August 2012) Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:

'The question of reconciliation in a Domestic Violence is a difficult one. It is quite clear that it is not a reconcilable offence, it being a domestic violence case and that being so, reconciliation as a mitigating factor is of very dubious value. A female victim will nearly always say that the parties are reconciled because she will fear the loss of the family breadwinner and supporter or she is forced to say it by her accused husband. A sentencing tribunal should always therefore look at a submission of reconciliation with great caution and suspicion. In this case, although the Magistrate has listed reconciliation as a mitigating factor, he later expresses doubts whether it was voluntary or not because the victim did not confirm it in Court. It was a submission of the accused.'

	1.	The learned Magistrate had not mentioned that he considered reconciliation as a ground of mitigation. However, he had deducted 2 months for mitigation. In the circumstances the learned Magistrate is justified in making that deduction for all the mitigation.

	2.	The sentence is well within the accepted tariff for the offence. The Magistrate has not made any error of law in passing the sentence, and in the circumstances it is entirely appropriate sentence. The appeal against the sentence has no merit and is dismissed.

	3.	For the reasons given above the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

58,705,71512,"SENTENCE

1. You, Pritesh Chandra are to be sentenced upon being convicted for the charge of grievous harm contrary to Section 258 of the Crimes Decree No 44 of 2009.

2. The maximum punishment for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years.

3. The victim is your wife. On the 20th June 2011 you were drinking beer at home with some friends. The victim over heard that you were planing to go to the sea side to drink with some girls. When you were getting ready to leave, the victim insisted that she should also come with you. When you refused to take her she told you that she knows the reason as to why you do not want to take her. The victim took a bottle of rum and went to the next door house where her mother lives. You followed her and demanded the bottle. You grabbed the bottle and hit her with the bottle on her head. It landed on the left ridge of the victim's eye. The victim received injuries and the matter was reported to the Police. You admitted the summary of facts.

4. According to the medical report of the victim she has received a mild head injury due to assault. The doctor has further stated that ""head injury in any state is serious injury which can be fatal if left unattended"". Also it was observed as per the summary of facts that the victim had fainted at the Police Station when she came to lodge the complainant whereby she was admitted to the hospital. 

5. In mitigation you said that you were drunk and it happened under the influence of liquor. You said that you will not re offend. Further you informed Court that you have reconciled with the victim and now live together with her.

6. It should be noted that committing an offence under the influence of liquor is no defence. It appears that you are trying to shroud your coward acts with drunkenness. The Courts and the society denounce this type of domestic violence acts under any circumstances. Further it should be stated that reconciliation does not reduce the gravity of the offence although it can be considered as a mitigatory factor.

7. In State V David Batiratu HAR 01/2012 Chief Justice Gates stated;

""There may have been association here with reconciliation. Reconciliation is maintained in the Criminal Procedure Decree [section 154]; it was originally provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code at section 163. The promotion of reconciliation applies only to charges for offences of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, criminal trespass or damaging property. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Decree provides a much more detailed section than its predecessor, taking into account appropriate forms of apology, respect for the victim, mandatory counselling, rehabilitation, promises and undertakings to alter habits or conduct, such as the consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs. Most especially the court must be satisfied that reconciliation is in the interests of any victim of crime to proceed in such a manner. This approach gives proper protection to children, women, or vulnerable persons. It also indicates the need for awareness of improper pressures which might be exerted to force through reconciliation. I respectfully suggest the old cases, approving discounts in sentence for cases where the complainant wished to withdraw are no longer the correct approach': See Rt Peni Baleidraiba Kevetibau v State (1992) 38 FLR 110.

Not only is assault on a police officer not included in the list of offences where reconciliation may be considered, the offence is one too serious by its nature for the matter to be settled in such a way. Though the instant case may be one ""not aggravated by degree"", it is not one ""substantially of a personal or private nature."" As a matter of public policy for the maintenance of law and order, assault on police cases like those of domestic violence would be entirely unsuitable for termination by mere amicable settlement"". 

8. You have 3 previous convictions including one for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It does not appear that you have attempted to stay away from troubles. However you pleaded guilty saving the Court's time.

9. In this case I pick my starting point as 18 months. For the mitigatory circumstances I reduce the sentence by 3 months. For the early plea I reduce another 5 months. Accordingly I arrive at a sentence of 10 months imprisonment.

10. The offenders who create violence at home very often get away by exerting pressure on the victims to settle. On the other hand the victims tend to reconcile with offenders due to social stigma and to save their families. Yet the Courts have a duty to send a strong message to those who are minded to indulge in similar acts, that the society condemns domestic violence despite subsequent reconciliations between parties.

11. I have taken into account the seriousness of the offence you committed and also the mitigatory circumstances. I am of the view that this offence attracts a custodial sentence as far as the nature of this offence is concerned. However having considered the fact that you have reconciled with the victim I decide to partially suspend the sentence. 

12. Accordingly I impose 10 months imprisonment on you. I order that you should serve a one month imprisonment and the balance 9 months imprisonment is suspended for 5 years.

28 days to appeal.

Gamalath, JA
 
[1] The appellant was charged in the High Court, Suva with one representative count of rape under Section 207(1) and (2)(a) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009 and the particulars of the offence are as follows:
 
 
“Statement of Offence
 
 
Rape : Contrary to Section 207 (1) (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
Iowane Isikeli Senilolokula, on the 1st day of April, 2011 and 30th day of June 2011 at the Gospel School for the Deaf, Suva in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of S. V. without her consent.”
 
 
[2] On 31 July 2013, at the conclusion of the trial in which the appellant had elected to testify on his behalf, the assessors were unanimous in their opinion that the appellant was guilty as charged. Accordingly, the learned trial Judge convicted the appellant.
 
 
[3] On 31 July 2013, the learned trial judge sentenced the appellant to 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years.
 
 
[4] Initially, the appellant’s only ground of appeal was against the said conviction. On 20 November 2014, the learned Single Judge decided correctly that the said application cannot be allowed for want of valid reasons.
 
 
[5] Nonetheless, acting “ex mere motu” the learned Single Judge ruled that there were erroneous considerations taken into account by the learned sentencing judge in the computation of the sentence of 16 years imprisonment. In his concluding remarks the learned Single Judge had stated that “arguably, the appellant was punished twice based on the same fact”. In the circumstances, the Learned Single Judge determined that there is an arguable point with regard to the sentence of imprisonment. 
 
 
 The ground of appeal in the instant appeal
 
 
[6] Based on the outcome of the said ruling of the learned Single Judge the appellant has launched the present appeal to canvass the sentence of imprisonment on the basis that the learned trial judge had erred by allowing the extraneous factors to influence the final quantification of the sentence of imprisonment. Mr. Lee, learned counsel for the appellant, at the very outset of the hearing of this appeal submitted that the appellant does not wish to renew the ground of appeal against the conviction. Responding to the Court’s query raised out of abundance of caution, the learned Counsel further consulted the appellant in open court and reassured that the only ground of appeal the appellant wishes to pursue presently is the arguable complexion of the sentence of imprisonment, about which reference has already been made above.
 
 
 
A brief narration of facts relating to the appeal
 
 
[7] As far as the factual matrix of this case is concerned, it does not offer any contentious issue to be decided in this appeal. The learned trial judge had dealt with the facts correctly in the summing up. Stating succinctly, the victim was a differently able, deaf girl boarded at Harland Hostel, specially established to cater to the needs of the children with hearing impairment. There were about 12 girls residing in the hostel at the time relevant to this incident. The appellant and his wife were its wardens. The appellant’s family also had living quarters in the hostel itself. In addition to his duties as the warden, the appellant was teaching the Bible to the inmates as well. The inmates addressed the appellant “daddy”, a clear expression of their filial affection. However, as far as the victim was concerned, the appellant seemed to have taken the path leading into temptation. In order to ensure what was going on between the victim and himself shall remain a closely guarded secret, the appellant had taken all sorts of precautions. He made the victim believe that pre-marital sex with him would make her well versed in the art of making her prospective husband sexually gratified. According to the victim, the appellant had once even indulged in having sodomy with her in the school toilet.
 
 
As a result of the continuing saga even the victim’s health had deteriorated .Her education also has got disrupted and she was unable to sit an examination. However, on one particular day whilst reading a verse in the Psalms in which it states that “Lord you have evaluated me and you know all about me” the victim became reflective of what was going on with the appellant. Hence the decision to report the matter to a member of the teaching staff. In turn the matter was reported to the police and thus began the legal proceedings against the appellant. 
 
 
At the trial the appellant testified on his behalf. He showed no remorse over what had happened between him and the victim, save that his only regret was he committed adultery. These are the facts in brief in this appeal.
 
 
The impugned sentence of imprisonment
 
 
[8] In order to understand the basis of the ground of appeal, one need to examine closely the several factors upon which the Learned High Court Judge had placed reliance in calculating the final sentence of imprisonment. As can be understood, the trial judge’s primary source of information had been the inferences drawn out of the evidence at the trial. In addition the learned trial judge had relied on the victim impact statement too in assessing the sentence. Referring to the victim impact statement it contains the victim’s complaints about the bouts of depressions that she plunges into as a result of the bad memories of the sexual encounters with the appellant. Considering its relevancy to the appeal shall now enumerate the several distinct factors upon which the learned trial judge had relied in arriving at the final composite sentence.
 
 
 
The Starting Point
 
 
[9] The learned trial judge picked 8 years as the starting point; that is almost the lowest from the range of the tariff for rape. Compared with the gravity of the offence and the seriousness of the attendant circumstances surrounding this case, there can never be any complaint against this generous concession given in favor of the appellant.
 
 
 The aggravating factors
 
(i) According to the learned trial Judge, the appellant’s authoritative position in the hostel as its warden, the other one being his own wife, should be viewed with a degree of seriousness that it warrants. Besides, he was the Bible teacher and a member of the counseling team.
 
 Based on these material the learned trial Judge concluded that the appellant had abused his power and authority over the victim to achieve his sexual gratification. Having considered it as an aggravating factor he added 3 years imprisonment to 8 years.
 
 
(ii) The learned trial Judge had made a distinction between the abuse of power by the appellant and the manner in which he resorted to contrivances to make the victim believe that he was genuinely interested in making the victim well-groomed to face the sexual challenges that may crop up with her prospective husband. In the opinion of the learned trial Judge it was a distinct form of exerting his powers over the vulnerable victim. Thus the learned Judge attributes it to a form of cajoling. Here, what had been violated was the trust placed on him like a daughter towards the father. The learned trial Judge added another 3 years imprisonment to this factor.
 
 
(iii) Having done the calculation as described above the learned trial Judge had decided that the appellant had been opportunistic in his behavior towards the victim. In the opinion of the learned trial judge the disability of the victim coupled with the fact that she was naive and from a rural background had been taken advantage of by the appellant. For this fact the learned trial Judge added another 2 years.
 
 
(iv) The planning: - In addition to aforestated factors, the appellant had been crafty and his untoward sexual advancement had been carried out after meticulous planning. In another word, the sexual aggression was not something that had happened on the spur of the moment. The appellant had planned the scheme and persuaded the victim to submit herself for his sexual gratification. Considering this as another distinct aggravating factor, the learned trial Judge added another 1 year. 
 
 
Showing lack of remorse
 
(v) According to his own evidence the appellant has had no qualms that his guilt was not about what had happened to the victim in his hands. He felt guilty for being an adulterer, an act of infidelity towards his spouse.
 
 
For the fact of showing no genuine remorse, the learned trial Judge had added another one year imprisonment. 
 
 
Eventually when all the components are added together, the total period of imprisonment should have been 18 years. However, by mistake it was laid down as 19 years in the sentencing order of the learned trial Judge.
 
 
In mitigation
 
Considering the mitigating factors, the learned trial Judge reduced 3 years and finalized the sentence at the point of 15 years.
 
 
 
The legal approach to the sentencing process based on some decided cases;
 
In Fiji
 
 
[10] In Kim Nam Bae v. The State, Criminal Appeal AAU0015 of 1998S, High Court Criminal Case No. HAC 0002 of 1997L, it was decided that 
 
 
“the task of sentencing is not an exact science which is capable of mathematical calculation. An appropriate sentence in any case is fixed by having regard to a variety of competing considerations. In 
 
order to arrive at the appropriate penalty for any case, the Court must have regard to sentences imposed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal for offences of the type in question to determine the appropriate range of sentence.”
 
 
[11] In the case of House v. The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, an often used decision in our jurisdiction, one can find the guiding principles that should be adopted in deciding on an appropriate sentence by the learned sentencing judge; 
 
 
 
“the appellant must demonstrate that the court below fell into error in exercising its sentencing discretion. If the trial Judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the fact, if he does not take into account some relevant considerations, then the Appellate Court may impose a different sentence. This error may be apparent from the reasons for sentence or it may be inferred from the length of the sentence itself.”(added emphasis due to direct relevancy to the instant matter under consideration)
 
 
[12] The above directions provide certain guiding principles to be borne in the mind of a judge who embarks on either sentencing a convict at the original court itself or reviewing the sentence in appeal. 
 
 
[13] Another judgment that is worthy of citing is found in Simeli Bili Naisua v. The State Criminal Appeal. No. CAV 0010 of 2003; 
 
 
 “It is clear that the Court of Appeal will approach an appeal against sentencing using the principles set out in House v. The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 and adopted in Kim Nam Bae v. The State...”
 
 
The four principles postulated in Kim Nam Bae provides clear criterion to be used to evaluate the legitimacy of the grounds of appeal against sentence. For the purpose of clarity and precision, I wish to reiterate them below;
 
Appellate Court will interfere with a sentence if it is demonstrated that the trial judge made one of the following errors:
 
  
• that it acted upon a wrong principle;
 
• that it allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him;
 
• that it mistook the facts;
 
• that it failed to take into account some relevant consideration.
 

The Common Law Principles upon which court acts
 
[14] The available literature on the subject acknowledges this as a difficult area of law. Thus, in many jurisdictions courts are saddled with complex problems relating to the manner in which a court vested with appellate jurisdiction should interfere with a sentence. “With the growth in the number of sentencing cases being reported it is becoming increasingly difficult to be precise about the principles upon which the Court of Appeal acts.” (2012) Archbold para 7-135, pg 1125.
 
In a broad sense, according to common law, there are clearly set out grounds under which an appellate court would interfere with a sentence; a broad brush presentation would show that an appellate court would interfere with a sentence under the following situations;
 
 (a) that the sentence is not justified by law in which case it will interfere not as a matter of discretion but of law;
 (b) that where sentence has been passed on the wrong factual basis;
 (c) that where some matter has been improperly taken into account or there is some fresh matter to be taken into account.
 (d) that where there has been a failure to honor a legitimate expectation; or
 (e) that where the sentence was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.
 

(i) Where the sentence was not justified by law
 
The Court of Appeal will quash any sentence if the lower court, in imposing it, has exceeded the power conferred on it by Parliament and will do so even there may be a statutory prohibition on appeals against such a “sentence.”
 
R v. Cain [1984] UKPC 1; [1985] AC 46, HL
 
R v. Wehner 65 Cr. App. R.
 
Thus, a sentence may be quashed because it exceeds the prescribed maximum, because there was no power to impose it in the particular circumstances or because some procedural requirement has not been complied with – R v. Marquis, 59 Cr. App. R. 228. 
 
(ii) Sentence upon wrong factual basis
 
Where the evidence would justify only one view of the facts but the sentence is passed on a basis which is mere supposition, the sentence will be quashed. (2012) Archbold para 7-136 p. 1126
 
See: R v. Reeves [1983] Crim. LR. 826
 
“In many cases however, a verdict or plea of guilty admits two or more possible views of the facts. In such cases, the Court of Appeal will intervene if it concludes that the sentencing authority has made the wrong decision or has adopted the wrong procedure for determining the issue.” 
 
See: R v. Ayensu & Ayensu, 4 Cr. App. R. (S) 248
 
R v. Newton, 77 Cr. App. R. 13;
 
R v. McGrash and Casey, 5 Cr. App. R. (S) 460;
 
R v. Courtie [1984] AC 463 HL
 
R v. Solomon & Triumph, 6 Cr. App. R. (S) 120
 
(iii) Matters improperly taken into account or fresh matters to be taken into account
 
 (a) The Court of Appeal will interfere with a sentence where there had been an error by the Judge in appreciating the material laid before him relating to the appellant’s history.

R v. Wilson 70 Cr. App. R. 219
 
(b) It will also intervene where the sentence has been or may have been affected by inadmissible evidence relating to the defendant’s character or by some irrelevant consideration, such as the nature of his defense.
 
(iv) Failure to honor legitimate expectation
 
 R v. Gibson [2004] 2 Cr App R (5) 84, CA
 
 R v. Turner [2006] 1 Cr App R (5) 95
 
 R v. McDough [2006] 1 Cr App R (5) 111
 
If the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle, the Court of Appeal will intervene.
 
 (v) Sentence manifesting excessive or wrong principle
 
 “These are not distinct grounds of appeal; the Court will conclude that if the sentence is manifestly excessive there must have been an error in principle. Where the approach is adopted, the Court will not interfere with the discretion of the sentencing court merely on the ground that it might have passed a somewhat different sentence.”
 
 R v.Gumbs, 19 Cr App R 74, (2012) Archbold, para 7-141 pg. 1127
 
 R v. Ball, 35 Cr. App. R. 164 CA.
 
 In an interesting judgment on the need to observe uniformity in sentencing it was decided that 
 
 “The Court of Appeal aims not at uniformity of sentence but at uniformity of approach”; R v. Bibi 71 Cr. App. R. 360
 
 
The sentence in the instant appeal
 
 
[15 ] I have given careful consideration to the principles of law that should be considered at the appeal stage in dealing with a sentence of imprisonment imposed in a lower court, in this case the High Court. The Judgments cited above both from Fiji jurisdiction as well as common law principles do shine a light on the relevant principles to be adopted vis-a-vis the facts of the case.
 
 
[16] The main thrust of the contention of the appellant against the sentence is that it is excessive, for the learned High Court Judge had erred by resorting to “double counting” on aggravating factors.
 
[17] In this regard, I am quite mindful of the fact that the learned High Court Judge had been operating within the correct principles of law in assessing the sentence and he had used the decision in State v. Marawa (2004) FJHC 339, as his conceptual base in developing the process involved in quantifying the final sentence.
 
 
[18] As already stated, one cannot take umbrage at the starting point of 8 years that the learned High Court Judge had picked in this case and as already said it is quite concessionary.
 
 
[19] Applying the yardsticks clearly laid down by the authorities already cited, and with special emphasis being attached to the decision in Kim Nam Bae, vis-à-vis the factual matrix in this case, there is one matter on which I entertain a certain degree of doubt, namely, has the learned judge erred in enumerating aggravating circumstances? In the sense is there a possibility of falling in to the error of doubt counting? Simply, has he counted some of the aggravating factors twice over by becoming fastidious and at the same time was he oblivious to the fact that the distinctions amongst already cited aggravating factors are hair splitting? In my opinion in situations of such nature the benefit must be enured by the appellant and the sentence must be altered accordingly.
 
 
[20] The legal principle to be adopted in deciding on a ground of this nature is referable to the principle that “the decision of the sentencing judge had been based on a factually wrong premise”.
 
 
[21] As it is surfacing from the evidence of this case, I have no doubt about the fact that there is clear evidence pointing to the direction that the appellant had abused the authority and breached the trust as the warden of the hostel. Besides, the targeted victim was a particularly vulnerable person with an innate physical disability.
 
 
[22] The learned High Court Judge, having imposed 3 years imprisonment to the appellant’s abuse of authority (see para 11 of sentencing remarks) added another 3 years imprisonment for the breach of trust (para 12) and yet another 2 years imprisonment for being opportunistic (para. 13).
 
 
[23] Herein I am finding it difficult to comprehend as to the correct means through which a clear distinction can be made between the two overlapping factors namely “position of authority” and “the breach of trust”. Their subtle nuances apart, I perceive them to be inseparably interconnected and in the circumstances, a valid doubt can be entertained with regard to the maintainability of both aggravating factors, side by side, parallel to each other.
 
 
[24] I wish to resolve this doubt in favor of the appellant. Avoiding the perceived double counting, the two segments of the aggravating factors should be rolled up together to be read as one. In the circumstances the aggravating factors of abuse of position of authority and the breach of trust should attract only 3 years composite imprisonment.
 
 
[25] This brings me to another factor that the State has raised in his submissions. The State has correctly pointed out the error in the calculation of the sentence and concluded that the final sentence of imprisonment should have been not 16 years, but 15 years. I agree with this submission. 
 
 
[26] The State submits further, that this Court should exercise our powers vested under Section 23(3) of the Court of Appeal Act and pass such other sentence warranted by law.
 
 
[27] Taking into account of every aspect of the appeal, it is my conclusion that the reviewed sentence should now be not 15 years imprisonment but 12 years imprisonment and this is in my view will serve the ends of justice.
 
 
Prematilaka, JA
 
 
[28] I agree.
 
 
Temo, JA
 
[29] I agree.
 
 
Orders of the Court
 
  
• Appeal against the sentence allowed.
 
 
• Sentence imposed in the High Court is set aside and substituted with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 11 years effective from 31st July 2013.

Statement of Offence

ASSAULTING CAUSING ACTUAL BODILY HARM: Contrary to Section 275 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

JEREMAIA KALOKALO TUISAWAU, on the 22nd day of September 2013, at Nadi in the Western Division, assaulted KARALAINI LIKU causing bruises to form on the face, neck, breast, chest, arm, back and thigh areas on the said KARALAINI LIKU.

At about 4.00am on 22 September 2013, the victim was at home with her boyfriend Siva. She heard the accused's voice beside her bed. Her husband was telling her boyfriend to get up and leave. She woke up to see her boyfriend putting on his clothes and leaving.

As soon as her boyfriend left, the accused began assaulting the victim. He punched her on her face, head and back. She tried to push him away but he kept punching her. The accused then tried to strangle her neck.

The victim reported the matter at the Lautoka Police Station. She was taken to the doctor at Lautoka Hospital who noted the following injuries:

- 2 bruises on the right upper and lower eyelid – right red eye.
- Bruises on neck, chest and breast, arm, back and back.

	2.	Accused Jeremaia Kakokalo Tuisawau, you stand convicted for one count of Assault causing actual bodily harm.

	3.	The tariff for Assault causing actual bodily harm appears to range from an absolute or conditional discharge to 12 months imprisonment as held by Hon. Madam Justice Nazhat Shameem in State v Tugalala [2008] FJHC 78; HAC 025S.2008S (29 April 2008) The extent of the injury which determines the sentence.

	4.	In Sereka v State [2008] FJHC 88; HAA 027.2008 (25 April 2008) Hon. Mr. Justice Daniel Gounder held that the tariff for assault occasioning actual bodily harm ranges from a suspended sentence where there is a degree of provocation and no weapon used, to 9 months imprisonment for the more serious cases of assault. 

	5.	You are not a first offender. You have 5 previous convictions for the same offence. In four of these cases the victim was the same complainant, your wife.
	6.	Considering the above, I commence your sentence at 9 months imprisonment for the charge of Assault causing actual bodily harm.

	7.	Aggravating factors submitted by the state are:
		(i) The complainant received several injuries as a result of assault made by the accused.
		(ii) Length and nature of the attack.
		(iii) Special vulnerability of the victim.
Considering all, I add 3 months for your sentence now your sentence is 12 months.

	1.	Mitigating circumstances:
		(i) You claim that you are provoked by seeing your wife sleeping with another man.
		(ii) You say that you are remorseful for what you have done and seeks the courts forgiveness.
I deduct 2 months from your sentence and now your sentence is 10 months.

	1.	For the guilty plea I deduct 3 months. Now your sentence is 7 months.

	2.	You were in remand from 24.9.2013 for a period of 5 months. I deduct that period from above sentence. Now your sentence is 2 months.

	3.	Considering the nature of the offence and the previous record, this court is not inclined to suspend your sentence.

	4.	Having considered the nature of the relationship you had with the complainant, I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) in place, identifying complainant Karalaini Liku as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any contact with the complainant directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.

Summary;
	1.	You are sentenced to 2 months imprisonment.

	2.	30 days to appeal

61,708,72120,"JUDGMENT

This is an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the Appellant in the Resident Magistrate’s Court at Suva on the 30th of March 2001 of a charge of Defilement of a girl under thirteen years of age contrary to Section 154 (1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 17. The Appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.

The victim was a little over twelve years of age at the time of the offence. A medical report tendered on behalf of the Prosecution stated that this was the second time the Appellant had defiled a girl under the age of thirteen and that the victim had been distressed, had been caused pain by the Appellant and had suffered a lacerated hymen. 

The Appellant presented seven grounds of appeal none of which in my view carries any weight. I am satisfied that the Appellant fully understood the nature of the charge against him before pleading guilty and that there is no substance in his claim that his victim consented to having intercourse with him. 

Section 155 (3) of the Penal Code states that it is no defence to a charge of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of thirteen years to prove that she consented to the act. I consider the Learned Magistrate committed no error in imposing the maximum sentence allowed in the Magistrate’s Court for the offence and I therefore dismiss the appeal.

[2] You pleaded not guilty to the charge of Rape. At the ensuing trial, this Court found you guilty and convicted you on both counts of Rape.
 
 
[3] The victim was only six years old at the time of the offences. You became her stepfather when you married victim’s mother in 2014. The victim called you Papa and looked up to you for love, affection, protection and support. You utterly disregarded your responsibility and sexually exploited her vulnerability. 
 
 [4] You sent victim’s mother to the shop and approached her in a pair of pants that was torn. You then penetrated her mouth with your penis. 
 
[5] In a few weeks later, you repeated the same shameful act on her. 
 
[6] You wielded undue authority over the victim and unleashed violence on her in the guise of disciplining her. You assaulted her in a brutal manner. As a result of which her mother had to complain to her school and to relocate her at her grandmother’s place to ensure her safety. 
 
[7] According to Section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009, the maximum punishment for Rape is imprisonment for life. Society views Rape as a worst form of sexual assault and an unwarranted invasion of a person’s privacy and dignity. A harsher punishment is warranted not only as retribution but also to protect the young ones in society. A clear message has to be sent to the society that this type of behavior is not tolerated in Fiji.
 
[8] The complainant was 6 years of age at the time of the Rapes and therefore, is a child. The tariff for Rape of a child is affirmed by the Chief Justice Gates in Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12. The starting point of imprisonment for Rape of a child is 10 years. The tariff is between 10 years to 16 years.
 
[9] In Mohammed Kasim v The State (unreported) Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; of 27 May 1994, the Court of Appeal observed thus:
 
""It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage.""
 
[10] In determining the starting point within the said tariff, Goundar J, in Koroivuki v State [2013] FJCA 15 has formulated the following guiding principles;
 
""In selecting a starting point, the court must have regard to an objective seriousness of the offence. No reference should be made to the mitigating and aggravating factors at this time. As a matter of good practice, the starting point should be picked from the lower or middle range of the tariff. After adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors, the final term should fall within the tariff.""
 
[11] In the light of the above guiding principles and considering the gravity of offending and the impact on the victim and, I commence your sentence at 11 years for each count of Rape.
 
[12] The aggravating factors are:
  
• You breached the trust the victim had towards you as a stepfather.
 
• The 25 years’ age gap between you and the victim aggravated the offending.
 
• You inflicted violence and thereby instilling fear on the victim, you ensured that the matter was not reported to anybody. 
 
• You exploited the vulnerability of the victim.
 
• The victim had to be relocated from her house due to your violent behavior.
 
• The offences you committed warrant harsher punishment under the Domestic Violent Decree. 
 
• You did not show any remorse or repentance and did not allow her to relieve her ordeal. In the contrary you relentlessly castigated the six-year-old victim as a layer who fabricated a false story to put you in trouble. 

[13] I add 2 years on your sentence for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 13 years’ imprisonment.
 
[14] The mitigating factors are:
  
• You are 34 years old and a father of two children. 
 
• You are a first offender;
 
• You co-operated with the Police during investigations.

[15] I deduct 1 year from your sentence on the above mitigating factors. Now your sentence for each count is 12 years’ imprisonment.
 
[16] In view of the Supreme Court decision in Tora v The State [2015] FJSC 23 and considering Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose a 9 years of non-parole period.
 
[17] Your final sentence is therefore as follows:
 
For each count of Rape – 12 years of imprisonment with a Non-parole period fixed at 9 years.
 
[18] Having considered the totality principle, I order the sentences to be served concurrently. 
 
 
[19] You have 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

1. The accused has been convicted after trial in this Court of the following count. 
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
 RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and (2)(b) of the Crimes Act 2009.
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
 ULIANO SAMUNAKA on 23 July 2017, at Navetau Village Saqani in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of (name suppressed) with his finger, without her consent. 
 
 
2. Kate (not her real name) is a married middle aged woman of the same village of the accused. In the early hours of the morning of the 23 July 2017, her husband was away and she was sleeping alone in her bed. She woke to intense pain, to find the accused on top of her sexually abusing her and invading her with his fingers. She could not shout out to relatives sleeping in the next room because he was forcing her mouth shut with his other hand. He tried to force her legs apart but she resisted, so he punched her twice on her thigh, then left the room and the house. She then managed to shout and alert a young relative sleeping in the next room, who went outside to look for the accused, unsuccessfully. The accused had been with his peers drinking grog and home brew from about 8pm the evening before.
 
 
3. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and sentences for rape of an adult range from 7 years to 25 years (Kasim Cr. App 14 of 1993 – C.A. and Marawa [2004) FJHC 338).
 
 
4. The accused has four previous convictions, one for indecent assault, one for theft and two for assault causing actual bodily harm.
 
 
5. In mitigation, his counsel submits:
  
• He is 27 years old, living in a de facto relationship
 
• He has a son aged 7
 
• He has worked as a farmer earning $100 per week
 
• He is a contract rugby player and is due to take up a contract in 2 months’ time
 
• He is the sole breadwinner for his family which includes his elderly parents, his 3 younger siblings
 
• He spent two months in custody before being granted bail.
 

6. Counsel for the State reminds the Court of the aggravating features revealed at trial:
  
• Violence was used
 
• It was a middle of the night invasion
 

 Sentence
 
 
7. I take a starting point of 7 years for this offence. To that starting point I add another three years for the aggravating features referred to above in paragraph 6, bringing the interim total to a term of ten years. 
 
 
8. The accused’s previous record reflects a history of violence and sexual assault and while he will not be penalized further for those convictions, he will not receive a discount for good character. 
 
 
9. His alleged prowess as a rugby player and his forthcoming contracts to play abroad are of no interest to the Court and play no part in mitigation in Fiji (see Batiratu HAR001.2012 per Gates C.J.)
 
 
10. I deduct 6 months from the sentence to reflect the two months he spent in remand and the arduous future for his dependents without him.
11. The sentence I pass on this accused is one of 9 years 6 months and he will serve 8 years before being eligible for parole.
 
 
12. He has 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal should he be aggrieved.

Names of both the victim and the accused are suppressed.
 
  
• As the information was read-out on 04th February 2013, the accused pleaded 'not guilty' to the charge of one count of rape (penetrating the anus with a finger) of a four year old boy (JN) contrary to Section 207 (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. SV, at that time was not represented by a Counsel.
 
 
• Despite his 'plea of not guilty', SV had tendered a letter to this court indicating that the cautioned interview statement, in which he had admitted the act complained of, was made voluntarily and did not wish to challenge the interview. 
 
 
• Having considered the reservation he had about the manner in which he was arrested, the court proceeded to hold a voir dire inquiry to ascertain the admissibility of the cautioned interview statement. 
 
 
• In the voir dire proceedings, SV again admitted the voluntariness of the statement, whereupon the admissibility of the statement was upheld. The cautioned interview statement supplied the main basis of the prosecution case. 
 
 
• On the eve of trial proper, SV changed his earlier 'plea of not-guilty' in respect of the count on rape instead tendered an unequivocal 'plea of guilty' on 9th June 2015 when he was represented by a Counsel. 
 
 
• Court accepted the plea of guilt after having being satisfied that it was voluntary and free from any influence. 
 
 
• SV agreed a set of amended summary of facts filed by the State on 9th June 2015 based on the contents of the cautioned-interview statement (which was attached thereto) in which the 'act' on the victim was admitted.
 
 
• On 11th June 2015, SV was convicted after he had agreed the relevant facts of the case. He now comes before this Court for sentence on the conviction.
 
 
• I reproduce the summary of facts filed by the State in verbatim which SV agreed: 
 

..........On the 20th day of August, 2011 at about 1pm, the victim, JN, aged four years old, a Kindergarten student of Nakavu Village in Nadi was going to his cousin's place named Margie when he heard the accused, SV, aged 18 years old, a form six student of Nadi Muslim College also of Nakavu Village in Nadi calling him into his house. The victim went inside the bedroom. Inside his bedroom, the accused pulled down the victim's pants and told him to turn his back towards him and then the accused inserted his finger inside the victim's anus and then pushed in and out two to three times. The victim could feel pain whilst the accused was inserting his finger into his anus and the victim started to cry. Around the same time, the victim also heard his grandmother calling out for him. The accused then took his finger out of the victim's anus and began to blow his anus in order to relieve the pain. The accused asked the victim to stop crying and then asked him if he wanted to have juice or ice block, but the victim did not answer him and then the accused opened the door and told the victim to go back to his house...
 
 
When the victim's mother was bathing him on that day, he told his mother what the accused had done to him. The victim's mother, SG of Nakavu Village in Nadi then called the Nadi Police Station and reported the matter.
 
 
The accused was arrested and interviewed under caution wherein he admitted to committing the offence. The victim was medically examined on the 21st of August, 2011 by Doctor Losana Natuva Lelagavesi. The doctor noted that there was laceration at 12 o'clock position of anal opening.
 
  
• The Counsel for SV filed submission in mitigation on 11th June 2015 which I summarize below: 
  
• Accused is a young and first offender. He was 18 years of age and had just passed adulthood only by two months at the time of offending. 
 
 
• Waiter/bartender by profession, the accused financially supports and cares elderly grandmother and thirteen year old sister who were abandoned by his mother in his teens.
 
 
• His early guilty plea, although not at the first instance, saved time of the court, prevented complainant from having to relive the ordeal he had unfortunately encountered and reflects remorse, empathy and willingness to rehabilitate. 
 
 
•  Accused fully cooperated with police during investigation and questioning.
 
 
• Accused sympathizes with the victim and his family for his act resulted from some error of decision, when he was severely annoyed by the actions of the young victim. 
 

 
• Rape is a serious offence. The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment. The starting point for rape of an adult victim is 7 years imprisonment (Mohammed Kasim v. State (1994) Cr. App. No.21 of 1993). 
 
 
•  The tariff for juvenile rape is a sentence between 10 and 16 years of imprisonment; the actual sentence will depend on mitigating and aggravating factors.
 
 
• The Supreme Court in a Special Leave to Appeal application (CAV00030f 2014) affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ananda Abhay Raj v State AAU 0038/10 which set the tariff as follows...
 

""Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 and 16 years"". 
 
  
• The question is whether this court, in all the circumstance of this case, is empowered or has a lawful justification to deviate from the accepted tariff set by the Apex Courts of this country.
 
 
• Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 provides as follows;
 

Section 4(2) (b)- 
 
 
In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;
 
 
Section6 (2) 
 
 
A guideline judgment given by the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court shall be taken into account and applied by the High Court and the Magistrates Court when considering cases to which the guideline judgment applies.
 
  
• Given the mandatory nature of Section 6 (2) of the Decree, there can be no doubt that this court is obligated to apply and take into account the guideline judgment of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court to cases where the guideline judgment applies. 
 
 
• Application of sentencing guidelines is important, I suppose, in bringing about transparency and uniformity in sentencing policy throughout each and every courthouse in the Republic of Fiji. 
 
 
• Having said that, I venture into exploring all the possibilities within the legal framework to see whether SV, given the special circumstances of the case, could be sentenced below the tariff set by the Supreme Court.
 
 
• Constitution of the Republic of Fiji in Section 11 (1) provides as follows;
 

Every person has the right to freedom from torture of any kind, whether physical, mental or emotional, and from cruel, inhuman, degrading or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment....(emphasis mine). 
 
  
• What 18 year old SV (as he then was) had done in this case was penetration of anus of the victim with his pointing finger. What prompted him to do that 'dirty deed' was explained to the police in his cautioned interview statement as follows;
 

Q.19: It is been alleged by one JN that you called him while he was going to his cousin brother and sisters house, Margie. What can you say about this?
 
 
A: I did not call JN, he followed me to the shop when his grandmother, Litiana sent me to go and buy cigarette from the shop and at the same time JN followed me.
 
 
Q.20: Then what happened?
 
 
A: I then came back and then gave Litiana her cigarette then straight went home.
 
 
Q.21: Then what happened?
 
A: At home I watched TV for sometimes and then went inside my bedroom to sleep.
 
 
Q.22: Then what happened?
 
A: While I was lying down inside the bedroom, JN came inside the room and then started to wake me up.
 
 
Q.23: Then what happened?
 
A: I was so angry and then wake up.
 
 
Q.24: Then what happened?
 
A: I then pulled down his pants and underwear and then told JN to turn his back to me.
 
 
Q.25: Then what happened?
 
A: I then inserted my pointing finger inside JN's anus.
 
 
Q.26: Then what happened?
 
A: I then pushed in and out for 2-3 times.
 
 
Q.27: Then what happened?
 
A: Then JN started to cry as it was painful so I pulled my finger out of his anus.
 
 
Q:28: Then what happened?
 
A: Then I went and close all the doors and then went and calm JN not to cry.
 
 
Q.29: Then what happened?
 
A: I then asked him what he wants, if he wants to have ice-block or juice.
 
 
Q.30: Then what happened?
 
A: JN kept on crying then I told him to go to their house.
 
 
21. In a rape case of penile penetration, the act speaks for itself and mentality of the perpetrator can easily be understood. When the penetrating object or thing is something other than the penis, it is not easy to comprehend what type of mentality the perpetrator possessed at the time of the offending.
 
 
22. SV says in his cautioned interview statement that he was angered by the act (call to wake up) of the victim which prompted him to do this. 
 
 
22. Since there is no requirement to prove, in a juvenile rape case, the mental status of the perpetrator at the time of the offence, a conviction can safely be entered once the physical act is proved or admitted. The question here is that are we to treat a person who is activated by lust for sex on the same footing with a person activated by anger when it comes to punishment for an offence in the nature of 'sexual' (rape)?
 
 
23. The facts revealed in evidence in Anand Abhy Raj case (supra), no doubt justified, in the opinion of the judges of Apex Courts, harsher punishment ranging from 10 to16 years of imprisonment.
 
 
24. His Lordship the Chief Justice Anthony Gates has quoted in his judgment the following aggravating factors the trial judge had taken into consideration in imposing the punishment.
 
 
They were:
 
 
(i) The Petitioner was the complainant's stepfather who should have protected her. Instead he breached the trust expected of him, and the breach was gross.
 
 
(ii) The rape offences took place continuously over a long period of time. Such an experience ""will surely scar her for the rest of her life"" 9 Record p.24].
 
 
(iii) She was a child of 10 years.
 
 
(iv) The frequently of the crime against children in Fiji, and therefore the need for deterrence.
 
 
(v) She had been subjected to threats to kill her, assaulted and injured by the Petitioner.
 
 
(vi) She was observed to be in real fear of the Petitioner. Such threats besides causing fear and anxiety in the victim over a long period, had postponed the exposure of these offences.
 
 
His Lordship emphasized ....
 
 
""...these aggravating factors made this a particularly bad case of child abuse and for the specific crime charged namely rape...""
 
  
• In the case before me, the factual position is quite different in that;
 

a. The convicted person is a young man aged 22. He was 18 years of age and had just passed adulthood only by two months at the time of offending. 
 
b. He is a first offender and has no criminal background.
 
c. He is engaged in a resort as a waiter/bartender.
 
d. He financially supports and cares elderly grandmother and thirteen year old sister who were abandoned by his mother in his teens.
 
e. His early guilty plea, although not at the first instance, saved time of the court.
 
f. Early guilty plea prevented complainant from having to relive the ordeal and misery, fear and embarrassment and having to give evidence and be cross examined. 
 
g. His conduct reflects remorse, empathy and willingness to rehabilitate. 
 
h. He fully cooperated with police during investigation and questioning.
 
i. He sympathizes with the victim and his family for his act resulted from some error of decision, when he was severely annoyed by the actions of the young victim. 
 
 
26. In the case of Moses Nariva v the State [2006] FJHC;HAA 0148J 2005, the accused was a young offender of 17 years old, juvenile. He was a first offender who pleaded guilty without wasting time of court and was remorseful. Madam Justice Shameem stated; 
 
 
""the courts must always make every effort to keep young first offenders out of prison. Prisons do not always rehabilitate the young offender. Non-custodial measures should be carefully explored first to assess whether the offender would acquire accountability and a sense of responsibility from such measures in preference to imprisonment''.
 
  
• Had SV committed the offence three months before, provisions of Juvenile Act would have prevented this court from imposing on him any imprisonment and this would have been a fit case to act according to Justice Shameem's wishes.
 
 
• Short span of three months can't justifiably make such a big difference (zero to ten years) and minimum sentence of 10 years is excessive and disproportionate to the wrong SV has committed in his youth. 
 
 
• Sentence should be in accordance with the facts of the case. Sentencing and Penalties Decree incorporates sentencing guidelines where it is provided in Section 4 (1) (a) that one of the purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by court is to punish the offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances. (emphasis mine).
 
 
•  This section reflects the Constitutional underpinning in Section 11(1) that disproportionately severe punishment volatiles basic human rights. 
 
 
• In the case of Kasim v State (1994) FJCA 25; AAU 0021 j 93s (27 May 1994) the Court of Appeal said;
 

While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point. (emphasis mine).
 
  
• Although this judgment predates the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, His Lordship had emphasized the pragmatic approach that a trial judge should take in sentencing rape offenders. 
 
 
• Current sentencing practices and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment is only one criterion to be considered by a court in sentencing among the long list of criteria in Section 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 
 
 
• I believe that every judge who sits in a court and hears the case in the court of first instance gets the opportunity not only to hear the case but also to see the case with the physical eye, to smell the case, to feel the case and to fathom the case with the present mind. The judge could hear the evidence and observe the body language of those who give evidence. 
 
 
• In my mind, the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 does not stifle the hands of the trial judge thus taking away the judicial discretion in sentencing even where there is a tariff imposed by Apex Courts.
 
 
• According to Section 26 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection, treatment, and benefit of the law. The imposition of minimum mandatory sentences would amount to an erosion of an essential judicial discretion in regard to sentencing. 
 
 
• The imposition of minimum mandatory sentences would result in imposing identical sentences in cases where court thinks it appropriate and where court thinks it most inappropriate which amounts to treating unequals as equals in violation of Article 26 (1) of the Constitution. 
 
 
• There are instances where Judges of the High Court have deviated from existing tariff when they find that the sentencing within tariff either disproportionately excessive or unjust in all the circumstances of the case. 
 
 
• In State v Nayate Vatu [2015] FJHC 263; HAC 231.2011 (23 April 2015) Justice Madigan sentenced a 21 year old for seven years imprisonment for two counts of juvenile rape with non-parole period of five years. In rationalizing his finding Justice Madigan stated;
 

"".....It appears to be extremely important in this case that a balance be struck between expectations of the community that such activity be punished and retribution be afforded the victim with the need to recognize the folly of such a young man with a clean record and the destruction that a long sentence would wreak on his entry into adulthood. Whilst every attempt must be made to keep a young offender from prison and to rehabilitate him (her) when faced with a serious crime or crimes, a Court must act in the interests of the public and their expectations and act to deter others who might want to follow the same course of action....""
 
  
• In his concluding remarks Justice Madigan said; 
 

""... I am aware that this final sentence of seven years is below the tariff for rape of a child and it is in no way meant to distort the tariff already recognized by the Supreme Court. It is a lenient sentence in recognition of the youth of the accused and his remorseful plea of guilty saving the child from giving evidence.
 
  
• In State v Seniqai [2011] FJHC 375; HAC 010.2011 (8th July 2011) Justice Gounder sentenced an 18 year old rape accused for 5 years of imprisonment, below the tariff. Justice Gounder imposing imprisonment without fixing a non- parole said;
 

""...You are 18 years old. Unfortunately, you are another unemployed without any meaningful purpose in life. You left school after completing Form 4. The International Convention on the Rights of a Child applies to you because of your age. I bear in mind that a prison sentence should be the last resort for a child.....""
 
 
 "" ....I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment. The purpose of your sentence is to denounce your offence and to deter you and others from committing this type of offence. Due to your youth I do not fix a non-parole period..."".
 
  
• There is no victim impact assessment report before me filed by the State although in its submission it speaks of, in general terms, effects on the emotional development of the complainant in a most disturbing and perverse manner. There is no medical report or evidentiary basis to support such a claim. Absence of such a report indicates that victim's natural upbringing has not been considerably impaired by the act of SV except for the pain the victim suffered when SV inserted the pointing finger into victim's anus. There is no evidence of penile penetration. The medical report only supports possibility of sexual assault. 
 
 
• There are two aggravating circumstances. SV exploited the vulnerability of the four year old victim knowing that JN would not resist due to his condition. SV breached the trust reposed on him by his neighbor.
 
 
• Having considered all the facts and authorities I now proceed to impose the sentence on SV.
 
 
•  To reflect the gravity of the offence of rape, not the nature of the offending act of SV, I take a starting point of 10 years at the bottom of the tariff for this offence. To reflect the aggravating features of breach of trust and exploiting vulnerability, I add two years to that starting point. In recognition of his strong mitigation of clean record, his duty to family, and his obvious remorse, I deduct those two years and bring the sentence back to ten years. For his extreme youth coupled with his potential for rehabilitation and his plea of guilty saving the child from giving evidence and being crossed examined, I deduct a further five years, bringing his sentence down to one of five years.
 
 
• The purpose of the sentence is to denounce the offence of rape. Due to the youth and clean record of SV, I do not fix a non-parole period.
 

Summary
 
  
• SV is sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. I do not fix a non-parole period.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to Court of Appeal.

[It was ordered to supress the name and the identity of the complainant pursuant to section 12 of the Juveniles Act.]

	1.	AliferetiKavurunalase, the accused, stands convicted for one count of 'Indecent Assault' contrary to section 212 of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. He was initially charged with two (2) counts of 'Rape' contrary to section 207 of the Crimes Decree and the trial commenced before the assessors on 3rd of February 2014. Before the commencement of the trial, the learned defence counsel informed court that in terms of section 218 of the Criminal Procedure Decree the accused wishes to tender a plea of guilty to a charge of 'Indecent Assault' and maintains his plea of 'Not Guilty' to the two counts of 'Rape'.

	2.	At the end of the evidence of Ms. A.M., the complainant, prosecution was left out only with the alternative of amending the charge to 'Indecent Assault'. The accused pleaded guilty to the amended charge on 4th of February 2014 itself and admitted the Summary of Facts to be correct. The amended charge and the particulars of the offence are as follows.

ALIFERETI KAVURUNALASE is charged with the following offence:

COUNT ONE

M. from the kitchen and told Ms. A.M., to 'do some bad things' after pulling her pants down to the knees. Then he had pressed and rubbed the complainant's vagina with his hands. The friend who was chased away by the accused had started screaming whilst the accused was engaged with this act with the complainant. The screaming had resulted accused running away from the kitchen.

	2.	Justice Shameem in the case of Penioni Rakota v. The State Cr.App. No. HAA0068 of 2002Smade the following remarks:

""Sentences for indecent assault range from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years. The gravity of the offence will determine the starting point for the sentence. The indecent assault of small children reflects on the gravity of the offence. The nature of the assault, whether it was penetrative, whether gratuitous violence was use, whether weapons or other implements were used and the length of time over which the assaults were perpetrated, all reflected on the gravity of the offence.""

	1.	In State v. AnandAbhay Raj HAC 009 of 2010, Justice Fernando selected a starting point of 3 years imprisonment and ended up with a sentence of 3 years imprisonment for a count of 'Indecent Assault'.

	2.	After having considered the 'offending' background, I take a starting point of 36 months imprisonment in this particular instance.

	3.	The complainant was just 6 years of age whilst the accused was 38, at the time of the commission of the offence. The age gap between the accused and the victim was 32 years. On the other hand, the accused stood as an 'uncle' of the victim, who lives in the same settlement. That is the sole reason for the accused could enter to the kitchen of victim's house without any disturbance. The accused took the advantage of his position and physically abused his niece. This amounts to a gross breach of trust. The accused had deployed certain amount of aggression to surrender the complainant when her friend was chased away from the kitchen. Finally, the Medical Examination Form reflects that several lacerations were visible around the genitalia. These factors undoubtedly can be identified as aggravating features.

	4.	The accused pleaded guilty to the charge of 'Indecent Assault' at the very first moment the Information was amended from 'Rape' to 'Indecent Assault'. Even before the commencement of the trial, the learned defence counsel informed court that the accused wishes to plead guilty to the offence of 'Indecent Assault'. The defence did not cross examine the complainant after her evidence in chief. In this context, this court views the approach of the accused would almost have the effect of pleading 'guilty' to the charge at the earliest possible opportunity.

	5.	The accused is a first offender. He claims that he was not in a proper frame of mind at the time of offending and thus seeks mercy of this court. His father and the clan had sought the traditional apology from the victim's family and they had readily accepted the same.

	6.	In this context, I add 24 months imprisonment to the starting point for all the aggravating factors stated in paragraph 7. Then I reduce 12 months imprisonment for the mitigating factors in paragraph 9. Now the interim sentence stands at 48 months imprisonment. For the reasons mentioned in paragraph 8, the accused is eligible for a reduction of a fourth from the interim sentence for his 'early' plea of guilty. Then the final sentence rests at 36 months imprisonment.

	7.	Since the final sentence does not exceed 3 years imprisonment, court wishes to pursue whether it should be suspended or not as provided by section 26 (2) (a) of the Sentencing and Penalties No. 42 of 2009.

	8.	This court is more concerned about the psychological trauma that the complainant underwent from the point of this indecent assault until she gave evidence in court. This court witnessed the pain of a 8 year old girl when she described her 'sexual' experience with the accused. It is a 'pain' which will be with her for the rest of her life. It is a pain which will devastate her social relationships with shame, guilt, embarrassment and frustration. Matter gets worse, when the perpetrator is a close relative whom she was taught to trust and love. This background does not warrant the final sentence of 3 years to be suspended. The accused will receive an immediate custodial term.

	9.	According to the case record, the accused had been first produced before the Magistrate's Court on 21st of September 2012 and granted bail by the High Court on 26th of February 2013. This court ordered the accused to be kept in remand custody since 4th of February 2014, pending his sentence. Therefore, the total period that the accused spent in custody in relation to this matter is about 6 months. In terms of section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No. 42 of 2009, it is ordered to reduce the said period from the final sentence of 36 months (3 years).

	10.	The remaining sentence of 30months imprisonment to be commenced from today with a non-parole period of 24 months.

• The accused is before the Court for sentence, after being convicted to the following charge.
 

First Count
 
 
Statement of Offence
 
 
RAPE: Contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (a) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
Particulars of Offence
 
 
Mateo Rokovesa on the 3rd day of March 2014 at Waica Settlement, Taveuni, in the Northern Division, had carnal knowledge of TA without her consent. 
 
  
• You pleaded not guilty to above charge. Following trial lasting three days in this Court you were found guilty on above count against you.
 
 
• After considering the unanimous verdict of Guilty of the assessors and having reviewed the evidence and summing up in this trial the Court decided to concur with the verdict of guilty in respect of the charge and also found you guilty and convicted of the charge.
 
 
• The following facts were proven in evidence during the trial. The victim in this case was 17 years old at the time of the incident. You are uncle of the victim. The victim had visited you on 28.2.2014. On 3.3.2014 when your wife went out to a village, you had sexual intercourse with the victim. Victim had not consented and was in fear that you will do something bad to her. The victim had complained to your wife the following day. The matter was reported to the police on 24.3.2014. 
 
 
• According to the Crimes Decree the maximum punishment for rape is Imprisonment for life. It is a serious offence. 
 
 
• The tariff for rape is well settled since the Judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice A.H.C.T. Gates in State v Marawa. [2004] FJHC 338; HAC 0016T.2003S (23 April 2004)The starting point of a rape of an adult is 7 years. The tariff is 7 years to 15 years.
 
 
• In Mohamed Kasim v The State (unreported) Fiji Court of Appeal Cr. Case No. 14 of 1993; 27 May 1994, The Court of Appeal observed 
 

""We consider that at any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point.""
 
  
• The tariff for the rape of children differs from that of adults and takes the tariff of 10 to 16 years. It was held by Court of Appeal in Raj v State [2014] FJCA 18; AAU0038.2010 (5.3.2014) Rapes of juveniles (under the age of 18 years) must attract a sentence of at least 10 years and the accepted range of sentences is between 10 to 16 years. The Supreme Court in CAV 003 of 2014 of 2014 upheld the above tariff. 
 
 
• In State v Mario Tauvoli[2011] FJHC 216, HAC 027.2011 Hon. Mr. Justice Paul Madigan held that:
 

""Rape of children is a very serious offence in deed and it seems to be very prevalent in Fiji at the time. The legislation had dictated harsh penalties and the Courts are imposing those penalties in order to reflect society's abhorrence for such crimes. Our nation's children must be protected and they must be allowed to develop to sexual maturity unmolested. Psychologists tell us that the effect of sexual abuse on children in their later development is profound.""
 
 
In this case 42 year step father was sentenced for 13 years with non parole period of 10 years for digital rape of 14 year old step daughter.
 
  
• In State v Anthony [2012] FJHC 1013; HAC 151.2010 Hon. Mr. Justice PriynathaNawana held that:
 

""The accused's engagement in his unilateral sexual activity with a little girl who was insensitive to such activity is most abhorrent. This kind of immoral act on a little girl of MB's standing is bound to yield adverse results and psychological trauma, the effect of which is indeed difficult to foresee and asses even by psychologists and sociologists. The depravity of the accused in committing the offence should be denounced to save little children for their own future; and, the men of the accused's caliber should not be allowed to deny the children of their legitimate place in the community. In passing down the sentence in case of this nature, deterrence is therefore, of paramount importance."" 
 
  
• Considering the above I commence your sentence at 11 years imprisonment for the charge of Rape.
 
 
• The aggravating factors are:
  
• (i) Serious breach of trust by the victim towards you as uncle and niece
 
• (ii) The age gap is 24 years,
 
• (iii) Lack of remorse,
 
• (iv) You let the victim relive her experience in Court,
 
• (v) You took advantage of the victim's vulnerability,
 
• (vi) The total disregard of the victim's safety and wellbeing.
 

 
• I add four years for above aggravating factors. Now your sentence is 15 years.
 
 
• The mitigating factors are:
  
• (i) At the age of 41 you are first offender 
 

 
• I deduct 1 year for the above mitigating factor. Now the sentence is 14 years.
 
 
• You were in remand from 24.3.2014 to 17.4.2014 and again from 22.10.14 to 26.11.14 for a total period about 2 months. I deduct two months from your sentence for the above. Now your sentence is 13 years 10 months.
 
 
• Considering section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I impose 11 years as non parole period.
 
 
• Having considered the Domestic nature of the relationship you had with the victim, I order a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) in place, identifying victim TA as the protected person. You are hereby ordered not to have any contact with the victim directly or by any other means, unless otherwise directed by this Court.
 
 
• Your sentences are as follows:
  
• (i) Count of Rape - 13 years 10 months 
 


Summary
 
  
• You are sentenced to 13 years 10 months imprisonment. You will not be eligible for parole until you complete serving 11 years of imprisonment.

67,714,79636,"SENTENCE

01. Sailasa Koroitamana has been found guilty after trial and convicted on one count of Rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of Penal Code, Cap.17. 

02. According to victim accused under the guise of taking her to Ba town on 12/10/2008, raped her at an isolated bus shelter. As she trusted him, went alone with the accused to go back to her original place. Immediately after the offence she ran to a nearby house informed the incident to the inmates of the house. After seen her sorry plight, they helped her to contact her aunt. 

03. In this case the accused took up the position that he never had sex with the victim. But he admitted that he accompanied the victim in the early hours on 12/10/2008. 
04. As per sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code, Cap.17, the maximum sentence for an offence of Rape is to imprisonment for life.

Tariffs for Rape

04. In the case of Chand v State [2007] AAU005. 2006S (25 June 2007), the court referred to the case of Mohammed Kasim v The State Appeal 14 of 1993 where the same court observed:
""We consider that any rape case without aggravating or mitigating feature the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. It must be recognized by the courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and the sentences imposed by the courts for that crime must reflect an understandable public outrage"" 

In Sireli v State [2008] FJCA 86; AAU0098 of 2008S (25 November 2008) the court also referred to the case of State v Lasaro Turagabeci & others HAC 0008 of 1996 and the court observed:

""The courts have made it clear that rapist will be dealt with severely. Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest sexual offences. It violates and degrades a fellow human being. The physical and emotional consequences of the victim are likely to be severe. The courts must protect women from such degradation and trauma. The increasing prevalence of such offending in the community calls for deterrent sentence"".

06. The accused is 42 years of age and separated from his defecto partner. He has five children in the age of 21,19,16,11 and 10 years respectively. He is the sole breadwinner of the family. He works as a labourer and earns about $42.00 per week. He has no previous convictions in the last 10 years. 

07. In O'Keefe v State [2007] FJHC: 34 the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the following principle of sentencing:

""When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person""

08. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

09. Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

""as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree"".

10. The objectives of sentencing, as found in section 4(1) of the Decree, are 
as follows:

	1.	To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;

	2.	To protect the community from offenders;

	3.	To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;

	4.	To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

	5.	To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or 

	6.	Any combination of these purposes.

11. Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, a court must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;
(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable and guideline Judgments;
(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;
(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;

12. Now I consider the aggravating factors:

	1.	The accused is a relation of the victim.
	2.	The accused under the guise of providing protection raped the victim on the way.
	3.	The accused showed total disregard to the victim's right to a peaceful life by committing this offence.

13. Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

(a) Accused is 42 years old and works as a labourer. 
(b) He is separated from his defecto partner.
(c) He has five children in the age of 21,19,16,11 and 10 years respectively.
(e) He is the sole breadwinner of the family.
(f) He has no previous convictions in the last 10 years.
(g) He has been in remand for one month and five days before being granted bail.

14. Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I take 07 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add 03 years for aggravating factors to reach the period of imprisonment at 10 years. I deduct 02 years for the mitigating factors.

15. In summary you are sentenced to 08 years imprisonment.

16. Acting in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I impose 06 years as non-parole period.

17. 30 days to appeal.

68,715,74760,"SENTENCE

[1] HAC 014 of 2011 and HAC 011 of 2011 were originated from one complainant. The victim P.B. had complained that these two juveniles had committed rape on her by inserting finger on her vagina. The Director of Public Prosecutions had preferred two separate charge sheets against these two juvenile persons. After carefully considering all, these two cases were consolidated for the purpose of sentencing only.

[2] Because both the juveniles and the victim are under the age of 18 years, their names are suppressed to protect their identity.

[3] The Director of Public Prosecutions had preferred a following charge against the 1st and 2nd juvenile above named.

""T.V.K. is charged with the following offence:

Statement of Offence (a)

RAPE: Contrary to section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

A.N.K., between the 1st day of January 2010 and 31st day of December 2010 at Nasinu in the Central Division unlawfully and indecently assaulted P.B.""

[5] The 1st juvenile was originally represented by his father M.G. Considering the nature of the offence this Court instructed the juvenile to get legal assistance from the Legal Aid Commission. Subsequently Counsel from Legal Aid commission appeared for the juvenile.

[6] Initially the 1st juvenile pleaded not guilty and the matter fixed for trial on the 29th August 2011. When the case was mentioned on the 11th August the juvenile informed the Court through his Counsel that he wishes to change his plea. Court explained the consequences to the 1st juvenile and his father in the presence of their Counsel. After everything was explained the 1st juvenile pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted the summary of facts. The father and the Counsel confirmed that the plea tendered was after due considerations. 

[7] According to the summary of facts the offence had occurred between 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2010. The families of 1st juvenile and the victim are known to each other. One day when she was playing with her friends he had asked for a kiss. She had refused then he had pulled her to his father's bedroom and removed her panty. The juvenile had licked her vagina and inserted his finger into the vagina.

[8] The 1st juvenile was born on 16th June 1995. As at 2010 he was about 15 years old. According to the medical examination form the victim P.B. was born on 25/10/2003. She was approximately 6 years old.

[9] The 1st juvenile had pleaded guilty to one count of Rape punishable under section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree.

[10] The 2nd juvenile A.N.K. appeared with his mother S.B. On the 28/01/2011 they were advised to get Legal assistance from the Legal Aid Commission. After few mention dates Counsel from the Legal Aid Commission represented this juvenile also. On the 22nd August 2011 the 2nd juvenile pleaded guilty to one Count of Sexual Assault and one Count of Rape. His mother and his legal Counsel confirmed that he tendered his plea after due consideration.

[11] The 2nd juvenile was born on 05/10/1995 at the period of the offence he was about 15 years old.

[12] Rape defined in Section 207 (1) (2) (b) of the Crimes Decree states as follows:

""Any person who rapes another person commits an indictable offence...A person rapes another person if - the person penetrates the vulva, vagina or anus of the other person to any extent with a thing or a part of the person's body that is not a penis without the other person's consent.""

[13] Sexual Assault defined in Section 210 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree states as follows:

""Any person commits an indictable offence (which is triable summarily) if he or she –

(a) unlawfully and indecently assaults another person."" 

[14] Counsel for the State submits the Court to consider section 30 of the Juveniles Act and a case authority of State v YM (2011) FJHC 58.

[15] The Counsel for the juvenile persons submits following factors.

(i) Both juveniles are presently schooling and preparing for their Form 4 Fiji Junior Secondary School examinations.

(ii) Progress reports of the 1st juvenile for the 1st and 2nd term were submitted. According to the report it appears he had done fairly well in his examination tasks.

(iii) Both juveniles are first offenders.

(iv) Both juveniles are very young teenage boys.

(v) Incident had happened because of their sexual curiosity.

(vi) The 1st juvenile and his father had apologized to the victim and her parents. Further they had paid a compensation of $150 to the parents of the Victim.

(vii) Similarly the 2nd juvenile and his mother also apologized and paid $150 to the victim and her parents. 

(viii) The mother of the victim child who was present in Court on notice confirms that these two juveniles and their family tendered an apology and compensation which was accepted by her and the family. 

(ix) Both juveniles are very remorseful.

(x) Both juveniles were pleaded guilty before the trial.

Law

[16] Considering section 20 of the Juvenile Act states as follows:

""The words ""conviction"" and ""sentence"" shall not be used in relation to juveniles and any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of juvenile persons, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.""

[17] Section 30 of the Juvenile Act prescribes a maximum sentence of 2 years.

""No child shall be ordered to be imprisoned for any offence...No young person shall be ordered to be imprisoned for an offence, or to be committed to prison in default of payment of a fine, damages or costs, unless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in an approved institution or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained...A young person shall not be ordered to be imprisoned for more than two years for any offence."" 

[18] Considering the offence of Rape especially when it is committed on a child, this Court shows no mercy. In the present case both juveniles and the victim falls within the definition of ""child"" i.e. below 18 years.

[19] Considering the medical examination form, the medical practitioner had not observed any injury on the child victim. Further there is no injury to the hymen of the victim. Further the doctor had not observed any abnormal behavior or features on the victim child.

[20] Article 3 of United Nations Child Rights Charter, of which Fiji is a signatory states as follows:

""1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration.

2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures.

3. States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision.""
(emphasis added)

[21] The concept of the ""best interests"" of children has been the subject of more academic analysis than any other concept included in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In many cases, its inclusion in national legislation pre-dates ratification of the Convention, and the concept is by no means new to international human rights instruments. The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child uses it in Principe 2:

""The child shall enjoy special protection, and shall be given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.""

[22] Considering the United Nations Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (""Beijing Rules"") adopted by General Assembly resolution 40/33 of 29 November 1985 describes the Aims of juvenile justice in Section 5 as follows:

"" 5.1 The juvenile justice system shall emphasize the well-being of the juvenile and shall ensure that any reaction to juvenile offenders shall always be in proportion to the circumstances of both the offenders and the offence.""

[23] Section 4 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states as follows:

(1) The only purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court are — 

(a) to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances;

(b) to protect the community from offenders;

(c) to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;

(d) to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;

(e) to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or

(f) any combination of these purposes. 

(2) In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to — 

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, 

and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option. 

(3) In sentencing offenders for an offence involving domestic violence, a court must also have regard to — 

(a) any special considerations relating to the physical, psychological or other characteristics of a victim of the offence, including — 

(i) the age of the victim;

(ii) whether the victim was pregnant; and

(iii) whether the victim suffered any disability;

(b) whether a child or children were present when the offence was committed, or were otherwise affected by it; 

(c) the effect of the violence on the emotional, psychological and physical well being of a victim; 

(d) the effect of the offence in terms of hardship, dislocation or other difficulties experienced by a victim; 

(e) the conduct of the offender towards the victim since the offence, and any matter which indicates whether the offender — 

(i) accepts responsibility for the offence and its consequences; 

(ii) has taken steps to make amends to a victim, including action to minimise or address the negative impacts of the offence on a victim; 

(iii) may pose any further threat to a victim; 

(f) evidence revealing the offender's — 

(i) attitude to the offence; 

(ii) intention to address the offending behaviour; and 

(iii) likelihood of continuing to pose a threat to a victim; and

(g) whether the offender has sought and received counselling or other assistance to address the offending behaviour, or is willing to undertake such counselling or seek such assistance. 

[24] I wish to consider section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

(1) In exercising its discretion whether or not to record a conviction, a court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including — 

(a) the nature of the offence;

(b) the character and past history of the offender; and

(c) the impact of a conviction on the offender's economic or social well-being, and on his or her employment prospects. 

(2) Except as provided by any law, a previous finding of guilt without recording a conviction in the exercise of a power under section 15 must not be taken into consideration for any purpose. 

(3) A finding of guilt without recording a conviction in the exercise of a power under section 15 — 

(a) does not prevent a court from making any other lawful order that is authorised under any law as a consequence of the finding of guilt; and 

(b) has the same effect as if a conviction had been recorded for the purpose of— 

(i) appeals against sentence;

(ii) proceedings for variation or breach of a sentence; and

(iii) proceedings against the offender for a subsequent offence. 

[25] The above section clearly shows that the Child Rights Charter especially, United Nations Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (""Beijing Rules"") have properly complied in Fiji.

[26] I am mindful that any offence especially sexual offences against children should not be tolerated. In the meantime the future of the juvenile should be considered carefully. As stated in the Sentencing and Penalties Decree the punishment should not destroy the future of the juvenile. In this case the evidence before the Court are the 1st and 2nd juveniles are capable students at their respective schools and they have performed well up to now. This offence would have been committed as claimed by the defence Counsel, due to sexual curiosity of that tender age.

[27] Section 207 of the Crimes Decree prescribes maximum sentence for the offence of Rape is life imprisonment.

[28] Section 210 prescribes maximum sentence of 10 years for the offence of sexual assault.

[29] Tariff for juvenile offender was described in State v YM (2011) FJHC 58. In that case Justice Madigan had imposed 6 months imprisonment and the same was suspended for 2 years.

[30] If these juvenile persons were convicted their future will be at stake. That might cause irreparable damage to their entire future. Therefore I act under section 16 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and proceed to sentence without entering a conviction.

[31] After considering all I impose the following sentence on the 1st juvenile and 2nd juvenile persons.

(i) You are kept under probation until you reach 18 years of age. The Probation Officer will submit report on every six months.

(ii) You should complete your high school education.

(iii) If you fail to attend school without valid reasons the Probation Officer should promptly report to this Court. If such report is received this Court will reconsider your sentences.

(iv) Probation officer is requested to arrange proper counseling programs for both during this period.

[29] The consequence of the above sentence is explained to both juvenile persons and their respective parents in simple language.

[30] 30 days to appeal.

",1,1,1,1,3,sentence,2628
69,716,76615,"DECISION

Background

[1] The appellant was charged with one count of insulting the modesty of a female. After trial on the 6th of March 2007 he was convicted as charged. He was given a 9 month suspended sentence. 

[2] He appeals against his conviction and sentence, citing several grounds. In summary it is submitted the learned Magistrate failed to properly consider the available evidence, was overborne by the young age of the complainant and otherwise failed to give appropriate weight to the defence case thereby reaching an unsupportable and erroneous conviction. It is said that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

[3] The appeal is opposed by the State.

[4] The appellant filed written submissions and otherwise emphasized his comprehensive grounds of appeal. 

The Evidence

[5] The prosecution was required to prove the following 7 elements:

1. the accused
2. with the intent to insult
3. the modesty of the complainant
4. uttered insulting words
5. intending such words
6. to be heard by the complainant
7. which is likely to offend her modesty 
[6] The prosecution called four witnesses. The complainant told the court she was a Form 2 student. She said that on 6th September, 2005 at 4.00pm she went to buy some goods from a shop at Caqiri Road. She said the accused came from behind her and held her and proposed that she should marry him. He showed her some money and asked her to accompany him to a motel and have sex with him. When she refused he said words to the effect that if she did not go with him then the appellant would rape her and throw her in the river just as Prem Chand had done.

[7] The complainant ran off home and immediately told her mother about the events. This lead to the complaint to the police and eventually the charge.

Conviction 

[8] In his judgment the learned Magistrate made some reference to the recent complaint of these events to mother by the child. That testimony was correctly considered by the learned Magistrate. Mother’s evidence supported the credibility of the child’s allegation.

[9] Prosecution Witness 3 gave important evidence. This testimony was not relied on in the learned Magistrate’s judgment but in my view reinforces the findings made. This witness was the Head Teacher at the victim’s school. He gave unchallenged evidence that the appellant had visited the school on that same day and told the Head Teacher that he wanted to pay for the victim’s school fees and also that he wanted to see her.

[10] The Head Teacher understandably became suspicious about this inquiry, checked the school records and saw that the appellant was not related to the victim. The teacher gave further evidence that the accused had come to the school seeking out the child on another occasion. I infer from the testimony that his presence was unwanted and he may have been making a nuisance of himself as the school then rang the Valelevu Police Station and asked them to investigate the appellant and his interest in this young school girl.

[11] In contrast to this reasonably clear evidence the defendant’s evidence can only be characterized as vague. He alleged that the complainant was lying, young and unbelievable. He conceded that he had been to see the young girl’s headmaster. The second defence witness provided little helpful evidence.

[12] The well reasoned judgment by the learned Magistrate is in my view unassailable. The learned Magistrate correctly recounts the evidence and makes a proper analysis of the facts to support his findings. 

[13] There is no indication from the record the appellant received an unfair trial. The factual matrix was simple to understand. There was one incident before the court. The Prosecution evidence was clear. The learned Magistrate’s findings in my view were appropriate and available from the evidence presented in Court.

[14] Accordingly for these reasons I dismiss the appeal against conviction.

Sentence 

[15] I find the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate was correct in law. The sentence was considerably restrained bearing in mind the circumstances of the offending. A suspended term of imprisonment was not manifestly excessive rather in the circumstances of this offending I find the penalty quite lenient. 

[16] The Sentence appeal is dismissed.

Conclusion

[17] The appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

70,717,264410,"SENTENCE
 
  
• Sulio Vuniamatana Tuinayau, you stand convicted of the following offences;
 

COUNT ONE
 
Statement of offence
 
Rape: Contrary to section 207 (1) and (2)(c) and (3) of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
 
Particulars of offence
 
SULIO VUNIAMATANA TUINAYAU between the 1st day of July 2011 to the 31st day of July 2011, at Kadavu in the Central Division, penetrated the mouth of MLV a child under the age of 13 years with his penis.
 
 
COUNT TWO
 
Statement of offence
 
Sexual Assault: Contrary to section 210 (1)(a)of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009. 
 
Particulars of offence
 
SULIO VUNIAMATANA TUINAYAU between the 1st day of July 2011 to the 31st day of July 2011, at Kadavu in the Central Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted MLV by touching her vagina.
 
  
• The assessors returned with a unanimous opinion that you are guilty of the two counts. This court decided to accept the unanimous opinion of the assessors and convicted you accordingly.
 
 
• Brief facts are as follows. You are victim’s grandmother’s brother and the victim calls you “grandfather”. The victim was living with you and your family in 2011. One day in the month of July 2011 after lunch, you penetrated the victim’s mouth with your penis. A few days later, you removed her underwear and touched her vagina. At the time you committed the two offences you were 42 years old and the victim was 9 years old.
 
 
• The victim was under your care and protection during the time you committed the two offences. You were in the position of a father figure to her and it was your responsibility to look after the victim. You have abused your position of authority and trust. You knew that your granddaughter was already a victim of a similar offence and yet decided to sexually exploit her. 
 
 
• Pursuant to section 207(1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 (“Crimes Decree”) read with section 3(4) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 (“Sentencing and Penalties Decree”), the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment. It is settled that the sentencing tariff for rape of a child victim is a term of imprisonment between 10 to 16 years (Anand Abhay Raj v State [2014] FJSC 12).
 
 
• I select 10 years imprisonment as the starting point of your sentence in respect of the first count.
 
 
• I consider the following as aggravating factors; 
• you abused your position of trust and authority; 
 
• the age gap between you and the victim which is 33 years; and
 
• you exploited her vulnerability knowing that she is already a victim of a similar offence.
 

 
• You have no previous convictions. Your previous good character will be considered as a mitigating factor.
 
 
• Your counsel has highlighted the following as your personal circumstances; 
• you are 47 years old, married with 1 child; and
 
• you are a farmer.
 

 
• Considering the aggravating factors, your sentence is increased by 4 years and I deduct 2 years of your sentence considering your previous good character.
 
 
• Accordingly, I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment for the first count of rape.
 
 
• The offence of sexual assault under section 210(1) of the Crimes Decree carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Following the case of State v Laca [2012] FJHC 1414; HAC 252 of 2011 (14 November 2012), this court has been applying an imprisonment term between 2 to 8 years as the tariff for sexual assault.
 
 
• You have touched the naked genitalia of the complainant. I select 2 years as the starting point of your sentence for the offence of sexual assault. Considering the aforementioned aggravating factors and the mitigating factor, I sentence you to an imprisonment term of 4 years.
 
 
• I order that you serve the two sentences concurrently. Accordingly, your final sentence is 12 years imprisonment.
 
 
• Your counsel requests this court to refrain from fixing a non-parole period in order for you to obtain the maximum benefit of the provisions with regard to remission given the present practice adopted by the Prisons and Corrections Service.
 
 
• Section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree provides that ‘when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole’. The only exception where a court can refrain from fixing a non-parole period when sentencing an offender for an imprisonment term of two years or more is provided under section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• In terms of the said subsection, a court can decide not to fix a non-parole period when sentencing an offender for a term of two years or above, if the court considers that it is not appropriate to fix a non-parole period given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender. According to the plain reading, the said section is applicable where a court considers that an offender should not be released on parole early and should serve the full sentence, given the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender.
 
• Therefore, I am of the view that section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree cannot be applied in order to refrain from fixing a non-parole period considering the circumstances of this case. I order that you are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve 08 years of your sentence in terms of section 18(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
 
 
• You have spent 05 days in remand pending your sentence. Considering the fact that I have deducted 2 years in view of the mitigating factor and the fact that the period in remand was only 05 days, I order that the said 05 days shall not be regarded as a period of imprisonment already served pursuant to the provisions of section 24 of the Sentencing and the Penalties Decree.
 
 
• In the result, you are sentenced to an imprisonment term of 12 years with a non-parole period of 08 years.
 
 
• 30 days to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

71,718,269275,"JUDGMENT OF THE COURT
 
 
Gates P
 
[1] On 17th July 2012 in the Nasinu Magistrates Court the Petitioner was convicted of rape contrary to sections 149 and 150 of the Penal Code. The offence was committed against his biological sister aged 23. On 25th January 2013 he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. The Magistrate had purported partially to suspend the sentence ordering imprisonment at the Corrections Centre for the weekends only. This was clearly an incorrect sentence, for the Penal Code only permitted the suspension of sentences of imprisonment where the term is for not more than 2 years [section 29(1) Penal Code]. The governing provision at date of sentence was section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act which had similar restrictions on suspension.
 
[2] The grounds of appeal against sentence were contained in a letter to this court. The Petitioner complains of:
 
 
 (i) the declaration of the Magistrates Court sentence by the Court of Appeal as being unlawful;
 
 (ii) the failure to consider section 18(2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act before imposing the 7 year non-parole period, and that the sentence was harsh and excessive;
 
 (iii) that the non-parole period was a penalty not in force at the time of the offence and therefore a breach of sections 392 and 393 of the Crimes Act.
 

The Facts
 
[3] When the matter of sentence was taken on appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the High Court, the facts were related by the judge in his judgment as follows:
 
 
“[6] The facts of the case were that the accused, an ex-Police Officer, was celebrating with his friends a Police win in a Rugby match. The celebrations had been on-going for some time and it is not in dispute that the accused was heavily intoxicated. He was aged 32 at the time. He had heard rumours that his biological sister, who was the victim in this case then aged 22, was involved in a lesbian relationship and he summonsed her to his home. He questioned her about this relationship and she denied it. He told her that he would “do something to her to make her forget she was a lesbian.” She attempted to run away from him and ran onto the street outside. In the sight of neighbours and his drinking friends he chased her and caught her and put her in so much fear that she lost control of her bladder and bowels. He took her back into the house. His wife was there and she made the sister clean herself up after which the accused kept her in a locked bedroom over a period of three hours while he subjected her to sexual indignities and penile rape. His wife was at all times inside an adjacent room. The accused when giving evidence of the matter says that he was too drunk to remember the details but he did remember having sex with somebody but could not remember who with.”
 
 
Ground 1 – Sentence was Lawful
 
[4] The Magistrate’s order to make the 8 years term of imprisonment a suspended term to be served partially in the community with weekends in the prison was not a lawful sentence. It was not permitted by virtue of section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. That section reads:
 
 
 “26. (1) On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
 
 
 (2) A court may only make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if the period of imprisonment imposed, or the aggregate period of imprisonment where the offender is sentenced in the proceeding for more than one offence, -
 
 
 (a) does not exceed 3 years in the case of the High Court; or
 (b) does not exceed 2 years in the case of the Magistrate’s Court.”
 

[5] I believe the Petitioner understands that the sentence was unlawful in that where a head sentence is as high as 8 years imprisonment it is not a sentence permitted by law to be suspended. Ground 1 is to be rejected.
 
 
Ground 2 – Failure of High Court and Court of Appeal to consider section 18(2) –
 
Harsh and Excessive
 
[6] The learned Resident Magistrate when considering sentence did not consider fixing a non-parole period [section 18 Sentencing and Penalties Act]. The section provides:
 
 
“18 (1) Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
 
 (2) If a court considers that the nature of the offence, or the past history of the offender, make the fixing of a non-parole period inappropriate, the court may decline to fix a non-parole period under sub-section (1).
 
 
 (3) If a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for a term of less than 2 years but not less than one year, the court may fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole.
 
 
 (4) Any non-parole period fixed under this section must be at least 6 months less than the term of the sentence.”
 
 
[7] He could have considered the issue, and declined to impose such a period by reason of “the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender” [section 18(2)]. He simply did not go into this issue.
 
 
[8] Upon appeal the learned High Court judge imposed a non-parole period (on the modified Head Sentence of 17 years) of 15 years. There was no past history of offending or of offending in this grave category of offences – serious sexual misconduct, specifically rape. We can be sure therefore it was the nature of the offence and the unsavoury and horrific circumstances of this crime that caused him to see the need for fixing a lengthy non-parole period.
 
 
[9] The Court of Appeal, recognising that the High Court upon an appeal was confined to a sentence within the limited powers of the Magistrates Court came back down to the original Head Sentence of 8 years imprisonment.
 
 
[10] The Court of Appeal in Livai Nawalu v. The State Cr. App. CAV0012/2012 28th August 2013 at para [4] had explained as follows:
 
 
 “[24] [v] The appeal court must, if it substitutes its own sentence on appeal or by way of revision of the Magistrates Court’s sentence, keep within the powers of the Magistrates Court. The High Court cannot substitute a Magistrates Court sentence with one which only the High Court can impose. The Magistrate is limited to a maximum term of imprisonment on each offence of 5 years [section 7 CPC] now 10 years [section 7(1)(a) CPD] and in total to 14 years where there are two or more distinct offences [section 12 CPC and section 7(2) CPD]. An exception would lie where legislation has specifically enhanced the power of the Magistrate to sentence beyond the usual limit.”
 
 
[11] Had this been an original sentence in the High Court for rape of an adult, the term to be imposed would have been within the tariff of between 7-15 years imprisonment. This point was clear to both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The learned Magistrate could have sent the case to the High Court for sentence. The circumstances of this crime were shocking and appalling. The offending should have been met with condign punishment and marked society’s firm rebuke.
 
 
[12] The suggestion therefore that the eventual sentence, settled by the Court of Appeal, at 8 years head sentence with a 7 year non-parole period was “harsh and excessive” is to be strongly rejected.
 
 
Ground 3 – Penalty of fixing non-parole period not in force at time of sentence. Sentence in breach of sections 392, 393 Crimes Act
 
[13] A similar issue came up in the case of Naitini v. The State [2016] FJSC 6; CAV0034.2015; 21st April 2016. In referring to the Sentencing and Penalties Act Keith J at para 11 said:
 
 
 “... it had been enacted by 16 October 2010 which was the date on which Naitini was sentenced, and the judge was, on the face of it, entitled to fix a non-parole period because of one of the transitional provisions in the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. That is section 61(1) which provides:
 
 
 “A court hearing any proceeding for an offence which was commenced prior to the commencement of this Decree shall apply the provisions of this Decree if no sentence has been imposed on the offender prior to the commencement of this Decree”.”
 
 
[14] Section 392(2) of the Crimes Act provides:
 
 
 “When imposing sentences for any offence under the Penal Code which was committed prior to the commencement of this Decree, the court shall apply the penalties prescribed for that offence by the Penal Code.”
 
 
[15] However the nature of an order fixing a non-parole period has been categorised by this court as not amounting to “additional punishment” Maya v. The State [2015] FJSC 30. At para [27] it was said:
 
 
 “... the fixing of a non-parole period did not amount to additional punishment of the kind which section 3(2) of the Crimes Decree outlawed. It was the court’s attempt to ensure that Maya would not be released from prison earlier than the court thought appropriate, whether on parole or by the operation of any practice relating to remission.”
 
 
[16] By way of elaboration of that reasoning Keith J said at para 17:
 
 
 “I do not think that the fixing of a non-parole period amounts to punishment. The punishment which Naitini got were the two head sentences. The fixing of the non-parole period did not increase those sentences. It only affected when he might be eligible for release by the operation of the current practice relating to remission prior to the expiry of the head sentences, but that did not make the fixing of the none-parole period punishment.”
 
 
[17] The section 392 argument was also laid to rest in Maya. Keith J added at para 19:
 
 
 “I turn to Naitini’s reliance on section 392(2) of the Crimes Decree. This was a case in which section 392(2) of the Crimes Decree required the court to apply “the penalties prescribed” for Naitini’s offences by the Penal Code. Those penalties were the head sentences he received. Assuming that section 392(2) required the court to apply only “the penalties prescribed” by the Penal Code, the question is whether the fixing of a non-parole period amounted to a penalty. I do not think that it did – for the same reason that it did not amount to punishment. The non-parole period did not increase the head sentences. It only affected the date when Naitini might otherwise have been released by the operation of the current practice relating to remission.”
 
 
[18] Fixing a non-parole period is not a novelty after the passing of section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. Formerly there was section 33 to consider under the repealed Penal Code.
 
 
[19] Keith J saw no real distinction. His lordship concluded the discussion this way [at para 22]:
 
 
 “Secondly, Naitini’s arguments do not take into account the court’s power in section 33 of the Penal code to fix the minimum period an offender had to serve. It is true that the court only had the power under section 33 to fix the minimum period for offenders who commit certain offences, whereas it was obliged under section 18 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree to fix a non-parole period for offenders sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a term of two years or more. But that is a distinction without a difference for present purposes. The fact is that even if it could be said that the fixing of a non-parole period amounted to a punishment or a penalty additional to the head sentence, the power to fix a minimum period which the offender had to serve was available to the court both before the repeal of the Penal Code and afterwards.” [emphasis added]
 
 
[20] That conclusion disposes of ground 3, and this Court must reject that ground.
 
 
[21] None of the grounds raise matters in which the criteria for leave to appeal are met. The petition must therefore be declined.
 
 
Marsoof J
 
[22] I have read the judgment of Gates P in draft and agree that for the reasons set out in the said judgment, leave to appeal has to be refused, the petition of the Petitioner has to be dismissed and the sentence substituted by the Court of Appeal must stand affirmed.
 
 
Aluwihare J
 
[23] I have read in draft the judgment of Gates P. I agree with the reasoning and with the orders.
 
 
Orders
 
[24] In the result the orders of the Court are:
 
 
 (i) Leave to appeal is refused.
 (ii) The petition is dismissed.
 (iii) The sentence substituted by the Court of Appeal of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years is affirmed.

Marsoof, J
 
  
• This is a pathetic case involving the repeated rape of a 10 years old female child named “DY” (actual name suppressed) by the Petitioner who was her biological father. D.V was born on 3rd September 2001, and as she was less than 13 years of age at the time of each incident of rape, her consent was not an element of each count.
 
 
• Charges against the Petitioner consisted of three counts, each alleging that the Petitioner did (a) between 1st November 2010 and 31st December 2010, (b) between 1st June 2011 and 31st August 2011, and (c) between 1st September 2011 and 5th September 2011, at Nadi, in the Western Division, inserted his penis into the vagina of DY, a 10 year old girl, and committed rape punishable in terms of Section 207 (1) and (2) and (3) of the Crimes Act No. 44 of 2009.
 
 
• The trial commenced on 20th February 2014 and lasted five days. On behalf of the prosecution, DY, her aunt Karishma Devi, Dr. Karalaini, Medical Officer of the Nadi Hospital and four police witnesses, to wit, DC Shailend Sashi Krishna, DC Vishal Kumar, DC Arif Khan and WPC Virisila Rakadi, testified for the prosecution. The Petitioner testified on his own behalf and was the only defence witness.
 
 
• At the conclusion of the trial at Lautoka High Court, the assessors returned a divided opinion, the 1st Assessor finding the Petitioner guilty of all three counts of rape, the 2nd Assessor finding the Petitioner not guilty of all three counts, and the 3rd Assessor finding the Petitioner guilty of only the first count, and not guilty of the other two counts of rape.
 
 
•  Since the learned Trial Judge was not in agreement with the opinions of the 2nd and 3rd Assessors, he pronounced Judgement on 26th February 2014 convicting the appellant on the second and the third counts as well. Accordingly, the Petitioner was convicted on all three counts of rape. 
 
 
• By his subsequent order dated 11th March 2014, the learned Trial Judge sentenced the Petitioner to 13 years 8 months imprisonment on each count of rape, the sentences to run concurrently. The sentencing order also fixed a non-parole period of 12 years of imprisonment.
 
 
• The Petitioner appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal, and the learned Single Judge of the Court of Appeal by his Ruling dated 13th March 2015, granted leave to appeal on all the three grounds urged by him before the Court of Appeal. 
 
 
• The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal on 15th May 2018, and by its unanimous judgment dated 1st June 2018, the Court of Appeal found that the three grounds of appeal urged by the Petitioner were without merit, and dismissed the appeal.
 

The Application for leave to appeal
 
  
• By his timely application for leave to appeal dated 26th June 2018, which was received in the Registry of the Court of Appeal on 2nd July 2018 and duly forwarded to the Registry of the Supreme Court, the Petitioner has sought leave to appeal to this Court on the following 3 grounds:-
  
• (1) The learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors properly that the evidence of recent complaint is not evidence of the fact complained of and cannot be regarded as corroboration but goes to the consistency of the complainant’s conduct with her evidence given as trial.
 
 
• (2) The learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he convicted the Appellant for three counts of rape when there was no evidence towards one count of rape as per the victim’s evidence.
 
 
• (3) The learned Trial Judge erred in law when he failed to remind the child victim about the importance of telling the truth before receiving her evidence resulting in unsafe conviction.
 

 
• The Petitioner has by a subsequent application titled “Notice of Additional Grounds of Appeal” dated 27th June 2018 also received in the Registry of the Court of Appeal on 2nd July 2018 and duly forwarded to the Registry of this Court, sought permission to urge the following additional grounds in support of his application for leave to appeal.
  
• (1) That the learned trial judge erred in law in admitting the police records of interview statement that was unsafe, unsatisfactory and not supported by evidence. 
 
 
• (2) That the learned Trial Judge erred in law in not giving cogent reasons for disagreeing with the majority opinion of the assessors that the Petitioner was not guilty.
 
 
• (3) That the Learned Trial Judge erred in not making an independent assessment of the evidence before confirming with the assessors that that the Petitioner was guilty of Rape, which was unsafe, unsatisfactory and not supported by evidence. 
 
 
• (4) That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in principle in taking into consideration irrelevant matters when sentencing the Petitioner and not taking into account relevant consideration(s). 
 
 
• (5) That the Learned Trial Judge erred in principle and also erred in exercising his sentencing discretion to the extent that the Learned Trial Judge took a high starting point of 12 years imprisonment rather than the tariff set.
 

 
• The three grounds included in the Petitioner’s initial application for leave to appeal dated 26th June 2018 were against the conviction, and the first three additional grounds urged in the Petitioner’s subsequent “Notice of Additional Grounds of Appeal” dated 27th June 2018 were also against the conviction, and grounds (4) and (5) of the said subsequent notice were against the sentence. 
 
 
• The exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Fiji to hear and determine appeals from all final judgments of the Court of Appeal is derived from section 98(3)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. Section 98(4) of the said Constitution provides that an appeal may not be brought to the Supreme Court from a final judgment of the Court of Appeal unless the Supreme Court grants leave to appeal. 
 
 
• The circumstances under which this Court is permitted to grant leave to appeal to a petitioner in a criminal petition are set out in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1998 which provides that:
 

“In relation to a criminal matter the Supreme Court must not grant leave to appeal unless: 
 
(a) a question of general legal importance is involved;
 
(b) a substantial question of principle affecting the administration of criminal justice is involved; or 
 
(c) substantial and grave injustice may otherwise occur.”
 
  
• The aforesaid criteria for granting leave under section 7(2) have been the subject of frequent judicial comment over the years. The stringency of the said criteria is amply illustrated in the following dictum of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v Rex [1914] A.C. 599 at page 614:- 
 

“Leave to appeal is not granted “except where some clear departure from the requirements of justice” exists: Riel v. Reg (1885) 10 App. Case. 675; nor unless by “a disregard of the forms of legal process”, or by some “violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise, substantial and grave injustice has been done”: In re Abraham Mallory Dittet (1887) 12 App. Case. 459.” 
 
  
• Following the same line of reasoning, this Court has observed recently in paragraph 18 of its judgment in Sharma v State [2017] FJSC 5; CAV0031.2016 (20 April 2017) that-
 

“It is to be observed that the injustice that is said to have occurred must not only be one that is substantial but also one that is grave. As such, even if the party succeeds in establishing that some injustice had been caused, that by itself may not be sufficient to obtain relief unless the party is capable of establishing that the injustice referred to is one that meets the threshold laid down in section 7 (2) paragraph (c) of the Supreme Court Act.”(Emphasis added)
 
  
• I am mindful of the stringency of the said criteria which are required to be satisfied in granting leave to appeal, and note that all the grounds included in the Petitioner’s application for leave to appeal as well as the additional grounds advanced by him are couched in language most appropriate for appealing against the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal, and not a single ground urged on behalf of the Petitioner seek to assail the decision of the Court of Appeal in its impugned judgment. 
 
 
• The three grounds set out in the Petitioner’s initial application for leave to appeal dated 26th June 2018 are intended to re-argue the same grounds that had been raised before the Court of Appeal. The five grounds raised in the subsequent “Notice of Additional Grounds of Appeal” dated 27th June 2018 are all fresh grounds that had not been raised, argued or considered by the Court of Appeal in its impugned judgment. 
 
 
• Considering the fact that though represented at the hearing before this Court by learned Counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Commission, the Petitioner was not so assisted while he applied for leave to appeal while being an incarcerated prisoner, all the grounds urged by him will be considered showing the leniency and indulgence customarily extended to person so circumstanced. 
 

Ground (1) The Evidence of Recent Complaint
 
  
•  This ground, which sought in essence to raise the issue as to whether the learned Trial Judge had given an “inaccurate direction” to the assessors concerning the evidence of recent complaint has been taken up and argued before the Court of Appeal. The Petitioner’s complaint arises from the learned Trial Judge’s direction to the assessors concerning the testimony of DY’s aunt Karishma Devi contained in paragraph 32 of the summing up, wherein the learned Judge said:
 

“You saw her giving evidence in Court. She had given prompt answers to questions put to her by the defence. It is up to you to decide whether you could accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt. If you accept her evidence it corroborates the evidence of the victim regarding recent complaint about last incident of rape.”(emphasis added)
 
  
• Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted before this Court that the said direction was likely to confuse the assessors “whether to take into account the 3rd count of rape or the last two incidents as to what was complained”. Although as noted by the Court of Appeal, the learned Trial Judge could and should have used clearer language in his summing up, in the context of the evidence of both DY and her aunt Karishma Devi, to which the attention of the assessors had been drawn by the Trial Judge, there can be no ground for complaint. As the Court of Appeal noted in paragraph [7] of its judgment, the words used by the learned Trial Judge, cannot be construed as a direction to the effect that “the alleged commission of the crime of rape finds corroboration from the recent complaint made by the victim to the witness Karishma Devi”. The learned Trial Judge, had made a rather broad statement by highlighting the fact that Karishma Devi’s evidence regarding the complaint she received from the victim does corroborate the evidence of the victim who in her evidence described how she reported the incident of rape to Karishma Devi.
 
 
• In paragraph [8] of its judgment, the Court of Appeal has made the following observation:-
 

“[8] The State, in dealing with the impugned passage in the summing up contends that the passage has not caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. In support of the contention the respondent has cited, Kehra v. State [2016] FJCA 1; AAU0117. 2014 (12 January 2016). Another citation in support of this proposition is found in Shameem Mohammed v. Reginam 29 FLR 154. Further, it is the contention of the respondent that the evidence for the prosecution, taken as a whole is sufficiently strong to countermand any possible negative impact that may have been left by the impugned statement. In my view, there is no necessity for one to go that far in understanding the kind of purposiveness that the learned Trial Judge was seeking to reach by forming the directions in that fashion. Primarily he was highlighting the nature of consonance emerging out of the evidence of different witnesses who testified for the prosecution at the trial and in my view, given the nature of the present issue any exercise that entails further analysis may be seen as superfluous. Moreover, since the victim in this case had been a 10 years child when she fell victim of the alleged crimes and therefore the need to look for evidence of corroboration has no relevancy in law in this instance.”(Emphasis added)
 
  
• I do not consider the ground raised by the Petitioner merits any further discussion since the Court of Appeal has dealt with this ground carefully and very rightly dismissed the appeal on that ground.
 

Ground (2) Absence of Evidence of One Count of Rape
 
  
• The second ground for seeking leave to appeal is that the learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he convicted the Petitioner of three counts of rape when there was no evidence towards one count of rape on the basis of the evidence of DI.
 
 
• Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has argued that though the Petitioner has in the course of his caution and charge interview admitted committing three incidents of rape, the child victim had testified in court to only two incidents of rape. Learned Counsel for the Respondent has relied on paragraph [41] of the judgment of this Court in Alfaaz v State [2018] FJSC 17; CAV0009.2018 (30 August 2018) where it was considered trite that a “man may be convicted, even of murder, solely upon his confession.”
 
 
• Given the circumstances of this case, I am of the opinion that there is no merit in the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner on the second ground for seeking leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal has examined this ground carefully and dismissed the appeal on that ground, and the ground raised does not satisfy any of the threshold criteria for the grant of leave to appeal.
 

Ground (3) The Importance of Telling the Truth
 
  
• The third ground on which leave to appeal has been sought by the Petitioner was also taken up before, and considered by, the Court of Appeal. This ground raises the question whether the learned Trial Judge erred in law when he failed to remind the child victim DY about the importance of telling the truth before receiving her evidence resulting in an unsafe conviction. 
 
 
• It is clear from the High Court Record that no oath had been administered on DY, the child victim in this case, before she testified at the trial. However, it is apparent from the proceedings of 24th February 2014, that the learned Trial Judge had asked DY a few questions to ascertain whether the witness could understand and answer questions. Having done so, the learned Trial Judge had concluded that “Considering answers, witness is fit to testify”. What questions were in fact asked by the learned Trial Judge from DY, and how she responded to those questions, is not clear from the Court Record. 
 
 
• Nonetheless, I have examined the question and answer appearing as (1) in the proceedings of 24th February 2014 up to question and answer (26), which reveal that the witness understood the questions put to her by the learned Counsel for the State at the very commencement of her examination-in-chief and how they were answered by DY, which demonstrate, in my opinion, two things: (1) DY has answered those questions extremely well and intelligently, and (2) the girl as young as she was, cooked her own food and also attended to some housekeeping chores, besides going to school. When asked what is her favourite subject in school, her answer was “Maths”, and her best friend was “Jennifer.” Her favourite cartoon was “Aladdin.” 
 
 
• The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted before this Court that the learned Trial Judge should have informed the child victim to tell the truth since she was a child of tender years. There is nothing in the record to show that the trial judge had informed DY about the importance of speaking the truth, although it is on record that she was not administered the oath before she testified in court. 
 
 
• In the course of submissions of Counsel before this Court and in the written submissions filed, the provisions of section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 2009 and section 10 of Juveniles Act, Cap 56 were referred to. Section 117 of Criminal Procedure Act, 2009 provides as follows:
 

“117. — (1) Every witness in any criminal cause or matter shall be examined upon oath or affirmation, and the court before which any witness shall appear shall have full power and authority to administer the usual oath or affirmation. 
 
 
(2) The court may at any time, if it thinks it just and expedient, take without oath the evidence of any person -
 
 
 (a) declaring that the taking of any oath whatsoever is according to religious belief unlawful or impermissible; or
 

(b) who by reason of immature age or want of religious belief ought not, in the opinion of the court, to be admitted to give evidence on oath. 
 
 
(3) The court shall record the fact that evidence has been taken in accordance with sub-section (2), and the reasons for allowing the evidence to be taken without oath. (Emphasis added)
 
  
• Although the reasons for not taking the evidence of DY under oath has not been recorded by the trial judge as required by the above quoted provision, the fact that no oath was administered by reason of the “immature age” of DY is clear from the fact that the learned Trial Judge had asked some questions from the witness to ascertain her competence as a witness and has recorded the fact that in his opinion, she was “fit to testify.” In my view, there has been substantive compliance of the provisions of section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code in all the circumstances of the case.
 
 
• Section 10 of the Juveniles Act provides as follows:-
 

“10.(1) Wherein any proceedings against any person for any offence or in any civil proceedings any child of tender years called as a witness does not in the opinion of the court understand the nature of an oath, his evidence may proceed not on oath, if, in the opinion of the court, he is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth; and the evidence though not given on oath but otherwise taken and reduced into writing so as to comply with any law in force for the time being, shall be deemed to be a deposition within the meaning of any law so in force;
 
 
Provided that where evidence is admitted by virtue of this section on behalf of the prosecution, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless that evidence is corroborated.
 
 
(2) If any child of tender years whose evidence is thus received wilfully gives false evidence in such circumstances that he would, if the evidence had been given on oath, have been guilty of perjury, he shall be liable on conviction to dealt with as if he had been guilty of an offence and the provisions of section 32 shall thereupon apply.”(Emphasis added)
 
  
• As already noted, the questions that the learned Trial Judge put to DY do not appear from the High Court Record, and it is not clear whether they were sufficient for the learned Trial Judge to conclude that DY was able to understand the nature of an oath or she was  possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of his evidence and to understand the duty of speaking the truth. However, assuming that the learned Trial Judge had given his mind to the above quoted provisions of the Juveniles Act, and decided not to take DY’s evidence under oath, it may be reasonable to infer that in his opinion, DY was possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of her evidence. However, as already noted, there is nothing on record to show that the trial judge did inform DY about the importance of speaking the truth.
 
 
• It is evident from paragraph [27] of the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal, the relevant part of which is reproduced below, that it did entertain some doubts as to whether the provisions of the Juveniles Act would apply to a child of DY’s age. In paragraph [27], Gamalath JA, with whom Chandra JA., and Bandara JA., concurred, observed that –
 

[27] Before concluding I wish to place on record another issue that attracts my attention within the pale of the facts and circumstances of this Appeal. This is in relation to the extent to which the operational sphere of Sec 10 of the Juveniles Act should be extended. In that context what is directly relevant is that Section 2 of the Juveniles Act defines a “Child” as a person who has not attained the age of fourteen years. It means in effect, that it covers a range of those who are in their infancy (Sect 8 of the Act) up to the upper age limit of 14 years. However, Section 10(1) speaks of a “Child of tender years” who has been called in as a witness in any court proceedings, including any civil proceedings”. In my understanding, the application of Section 10(1) is confined to “children of tender years”, a phrase that finds no specific definition in the Juveniles Act. In other words not all children who are under the age of 14 years are to be considered as “children of tender years.” For instance, there can be many children who come forth as witnesses whose power of comprehension of the oath and its significance may not be in doubt and whether such children should also be included within the category of “children of tender years” who should be exempted from the implementation of Section 10 of the Juveniles Act is doubtful to me. (Emphasis added)
 
  
• There is no definition of the phrase “child of tender years” in the Juveniles Act. Section 10 of the Act, which uses the phrase to delineate its ambit, had its origins in section 38 of the Children and Young Persons Act of 1933 enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which too did not contain a definition of the said phrase. The proviso to section 38 of that Act, as does the proviso to section 10(1) of the Juveniles Act, provides that “where evidence admitted by virtue of this section is given on behalf of the prosecution the accused shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless that evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence in support thereof implicating him.” 
 
 
• It would appear that the phrase “child of tender years” has been used in different senses depending on the objective of the statute in which it finds a place, and it is therefore necessary to consider the meaning of the phrase for the purposes of the Juveniles Act of Fiji, in its special context. This Act deals with juveniles who comes into contact with the law or are in need of protection under the law. A “juvenile” is defined in the Act as “a person who has not attained the age of seventeen years, and includes a child and a young person.” A “child” is defined in the Act as “a person who has not attained the age of fourteen years,” and a “young person” as “a person who has attained the age of fourteen years, but who has not attained the age of seventeen years.” This twofold classification of juveniles in the Act is important in delineating the ambit of section 10 of the Act, which applies only to a “child of tender years”. As Gamalath JA has observed in the above quoted passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, not all children below fourteen years of age fall within the ambit of section 10 of the Juveniles Act, and the question is whether DY, who according to the High Court Record was born on 3rd September 2001, was a child of tender years at the time she testified in court on 24th February 2014. At the time of testifying in Court, DY was a little more than 12 years and 5 months in age. Her testimony in court, specially her answers to question put to her in cross-examination, shows without any semblance of doubt that she comprehended the questions put to her and responded to them as any adult would. In these circumstances, in my own opinion, there can be very little doubt that DY was not a “child of tender years” for the purpose of the Juveniles Act.
 
 
• The Court of Appeal nevertheless considered the provisions of section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 2009 as well as section 10 of the Juveniles Act, Chapter 56 of the Laws of Fiji in the light of the recent judgment of this Court in Ravinesh Kumar v State [2016] FJSC 44; CAV0024.2016 (27 October 2016) in arriving at its conclusions. Having done so, the Court observed as follows:
 

“[16] I find that it is important to state at this stage that the questions that are asked to determine the competency of the witness should have a clear reflection in the Court Record, so that anyone who has a legitimate interest in finding the nature of the test carried out by the learned trial judge could gain access to the relevant procedure. The requirement to carry out the test of competency and the need to administer the oath of a witness are intrinsically interconnected with the norms of the right to a fair trial. In a situation where having regard to all the attendant circumstances a court is of opinion that the need to administer the oath should be dispensed with, then the procedure that is carried out in arriving at such conclusion should have a reflection in the court record. In the same way the court record should bear the evidence of the nature of the competency test carried out in determining the ability and the level of intelligence of a witness to testify without administering an oath. Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Act has made this requirement mandatory”.(Emphasis added)
 
  
• In the light of the facts of the instant case, the Court of Appeal observed in paragraph [23] of its judgment that “the procedure adopted by the learned High Court Judge falls short of clear adherence to the provisions of law. The Court of Appeal went on to observe that- 
 

“In other words, the decision to forego the need to administer the oath and to carry out a competency test are not to be treated as functions to be performed perfunctorily. Strict adherence with the degree of transparency that is required to be maintained through the relevant notes as per Criminal Procedure Act (Record of Evidence in the High Court) Rules 1950 would serve the purpose in situations akin to the instant case.” 
 
  
• However, as the Court of Appeal stated in paragraph [24] of its judgment, after carefully examined the entirety of the testimony of the victim, “it is quite clear that the Court Record does not contain even a semblance of evidence to support the fact that she was an incompetent witness or a witness whose testimony cannot be trusted.” Taking into consideration the fact that the prosecution’s case is not solely dependent on the evidence of DY as the caution statement of the Petitioner by itself provided incriminating evidence against the maker, the Court concluded that this is an appropriate case to apply the proviso to Section 23 of the Court of Appeal Act. 
 
 
• In my view, the Court of Appeal has examined ground (3) carefully and dismissed the appeal. The testimony of DY has been corroborated by that of her aunt Karishma Devi and the medical evidence, and the caution statement of the Petitioner also points in the direction of its veracity. 
 
 
• The identical ground raised before this Court, in my opinion, does not satisfy any of the threshold criteria set out in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court of Act for the grant of leave to appeal to this Court.
 

Other Grounds for seeking Leave to Appeal 
 
  
• It is now necessary to consider grounds (1) to (5) urged by the Petitioner in his subsequent “Notice of Additional Grounds of Appeal” dated 27th June 2018. None of these grounds had been raised in the Court of Appeal or considered by it in the impugned judgment. As this Court observed in Katonivualiku v The State (CAV 1 of 1999; 17 April 2003)-
 

“It is plain from this provision that the Supreme Court is not a Court of Criminal Appeal or general review nor is there an appeal to this Court as a matter of right and whilst we accept that in an application for special leave some elaboration on the grounds of appeal may have to be entertained, the Court is necessarily confined within the legal parameters set out above, to an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.....”(Emphasis added)
 
  
• As his Lordship Gates P observed in paragraph [28] of his judgment in Vaqewa v State [2016] FJSC 12; CAV0016.2015 (22 April 2016), where any ground that had not been taken up in the Court of Appeal is raised for the first time before this Court, this court would not entertain such fresh ground of appeal “unless its significance upon the special leave criteria was compelling”. In the instant case, the additional grounds urged by the Petitioner do not arise from the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal, and no explanation has been provided as to why they were not taken up before that Court in the first instance. The Petitioner was represented by Counsel at the trial as well as in the Court of Appeal, which court was better placed to examine the type of issues raised in the additional grounds of appeal. 
 
 
• From the perspective of the State and the society in general, great prejudice will be caused to the child victim DY, and children of her age who when they grow up will constitute the citizenry of the nation, if there is no finality in these matters. 
 
 
• I have given anxious considerations to the additional grounds raised by the Petitioner in the totality of evidence in this case, and am of the view that they are not only lacking in merit, they do not satisfy the stringent criteria set out in section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act for the grant of leave to appeal. No compelling reasons have been advanced for considering the additional grounds in depth at this stage of the proceedings. 
 

Conclusions
 
  
• In the result, I am of the opinion that there is no basis for granting the Petitioner leave to appeal in this case, and that leave to appeal has to be refused. The application of the Petitioner has to be dismissed. 
 

Ekanayake, J
 
  
• I have read in draft the judgment of Marsoof J. I agree with his reasoning, conclusions and proposed orders.
 

Chitrasiri, J
 
  
• I am in agreement with the judgment of Marsoof J. and also with his reasoning, conclusions and proposed orders.

73,720,261788,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused has been found guilty and convicted by this Court after trial of the digital rape of a 10 year old girl in Taveuni in May, 2014.
 
 
[2] The accused is a 60 year old Pastor of the Assemblies of God Church (AOG), and the girl was in his care living with him and his wife while she was attending school. 
 
 
[3] Over a period of four nights at a time when the pastor's wife had gone away to a Conference, the accused subjected the girl to a series of assaults and indignities culminating on the fourth night when he forced her to undress, lay on top of her and attempted unsuccessfully to have sexual intercourse with her. That having failed he then forced his hand upon her and committed this offence. 
 
 
[4] In a rather pathetic Victim Impact Report written in her own immature hand the girl attests to ""sometimes feel the pain my feelings"" and ""also sometimes it makes me tears and ashamed in front of the public"".
 
 
[5] In mitigation, Mr .Vakaloloma pleads for leniency because in the village his client is regarded as the father figure. 
 
 
[6] There is no difference in this Court between a callow youth and a Pastor and the fact that he regards himself as a ""father figure"" belies the despicable acts he forced on a 10 year old girl in his permanent care. Such a breach of trust is compounded by the breach of trust by a person in care of another's child and the breach of trust of a Pastor said to be in charge of the spiritual and emotional welfare of a child. This breach is so serious that even defence counsel recognizes it in his written submissions.
 
 
[7] Ministers of Religion whilst not being regarded any differently in Court, have a special role in society to care for the development of their followers and above all to set an example by leading a virtuous and noble life in fitting with their calling.
 
 
[8] This accused clearly failed to live up to those standards.
 
 
[9] The only possible mitigation available to the accused is his hitherto clear record. 
 
 
[10] Mr. Vakaloloma submits that his client is remorseful despite his written submission that there is ""lack of remorse demonstrated by the accused person for what he has done to the victim, suffering emotionally, physically and psychologically"". This Court agrees with the written rather than the oral submission. 
 
 
[11] The age difference of 60 years over 10 years is another significant aggravating factor.
 
 
[12] The maximum penalty for rape is life imprisonment and in following the Supreme Court decision in Anand Abhay Raj CAV0003 of 2014, which sets a tariff for rape of a child to be between 10 and 16 years, I take a starting point of 10 years for the offence. For the preponderance of the aggravating factors in the case I add to the starting point a further 7 years bringing the sentence to an interim total of 17 years imprisonment. To reflect the accused's clear record and the very short time he spent in custody before being bailed I deduct one year meaning that the accused is to serve a total sentence of 16 years imprisonment. He will serve a total of 12 years before being eligible for parole.

74,721,244788,"SENTENCE
 
 
[1] The accused was convicted after trial in this court of one count of statutory rape of a 12 year old girl and two counts of defilement of the same girl after she had turned 13 years of age.
 
 
[2] The facts of the case are that the accused and the girl's father were co-workers on a dairy farm in Tailevu. They both lived nearby. The two were on friendly terms and the complainant Ruby (not her real name) would call the accused ""Uncle"". It was agreed between the two men that Ruby could assist the accused doing chores such as cleaning his van.
 
 
[3] In January 2014 when Ruby was 12 years and 11 months old, the accused picked her up from home to wash his van. He took her to the farm and to the milk tank shed where he made her lie on a sack on the floor and he raped her. He gave her $20 (ostensibly for car cleaning, but she didn't do any). 
 
 
[4] In June 2014 when Ruby was 13 but under 16 the accused again picked her up from home to clean his van. He again took her to the farm and this time he made her lie down in the animal feed store where he had full sexual intercourse with her. He gave her $20.
 
 
[5] In July 2014 he collected her from home to take her to his home to ""clean the window"". He made her lie on his bed in his home and again had full sexual intercourse with her. For this he gave her $50.
 
 
[6] These incidents were detected on enquiry by her teacher who saw that she had an unusual amount of money with her. The incidents were told to 2 female teachers whom she trusted and her father was told. 
 
 
[7] At trial the accused denied any contact whatsoever with Ruby.
 
 
 The Law
 
 
[8] The Supreme Court has stated that rape of children will attract sentences between 10 and 16 years. (Anand Abhay Raj, CAV 003.2014).
 
 
[9] Sentences for defilement range from a suspended sentence for young persons ""in a virtuous relationship"" upwards to four years for older persons taking advantage of young girls. (The maximum term is ten years imprisonment).
 
 
Mitigation
 
 
[10] The accused in this case is 56 years old and a farmer. He has been married for 40 years and there are 4 children of the marriage who have all moved away. He has a clear record. He supports his wife who is bedridden with diabetes and high blood pressure and he himself has heart disease and high blood pressure. His counsel asks for leniency.
 
 
[11] The complainant Ruby attests to her post traumatic condition in a victim impact report. She has feelings of anger, embarrassment and lack of self-respect. She has a fear of leaving her home alone.
 
 
 Analysis
 
 
[12] Rape of a child under 13 will receive no mercy from this Court. It is an assault not only on the child's body but also on her quality of life with everlasting effects on her own development to sexual maturity.
 
 
[13] Defilement is an offence legislated to provide for girls between 13 and 16 the protection of the law from their own hormonal instincts but particularly from would be predatory men who would take advantage of them.
 
 
[14] For the offence of rape I take a starting point of 10 years imprisonment at the lower end of the accepted range of sentences for this offence. To that I add three years for the clear breach of trust in which a friend of the family and her ""uncle"" had forced himself on the young girl. There was a degree of pre-planning involved in the case in the he had prepared a sacking bed for the rape in the milk shed and he picked her up from home to take her to the farm to purportedly clean his vehicle. For this pre-planning I add a further years' imprisonment. The interim total now stands at 14 years but I deduct one year for his clear record. He will serve a total sentence of 13 years for the rape with a minimum term of 11 years before he is eligible for parole.
 
 
[15] For the defilement offence I take a starting point of 2 years imprisonment. For the breach of trust I add a further two years bringing the total to 4 years imprisonment. For the huge age difference I add another year but would deduct a year for his clear record. The total sentence he will serve for each of the two defilement charges is four years imprisonment. These two sentences will be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the rape sentence.
 
 
[16] The total sentence the accused will serve will be a sentence of 13 years for all three offences. He will serve a minimum term of 11 years. The community would not accept a term of any less, considering the gravity of this despicable crime.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence (a)

INDECENT ASSAULT: Contrary to section 154(1) of the Penal Code, Act 17.

Particulars of Offence

JONE LUTUI between the year 1996 and year 1997 at Samabula in the Central Division unlawfully and indecently assaulted ANA BULIMAIBAU by fondling her private parts.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial commenced on the 23rd of July 2002. Alumita Bania gave evidence that she was born in June 1984 and that the accused is her maternal grandfather. When she was 12 years old her grandfather first had sexual intercourse with her after he had asked her to massage his body. She said that he had sexual intercourse with her in 1996 and 1997, on more than 40 occasions. The sexual relationship continued in 1998 and on two occasions in 1999. In 1999, her mother reported the matter to the police.

Ana Bulimaibau gave evidence that she is the older sister of Alumita (PW 1). In 1996, on a Saturday when she had a pain in her chest, the accused fingered her vagina saying that he wanted to check if she was still a virgin.

Miriama Vakalaloma gave evidence that she was the mother of both girls, and the accused’s daughter. She said that in 1999 her mother told her that the girls had complained about the sexual assaults on them, and that she had reported the matter to the police.

A police officer, Epeli Vamosi then tendered the accused’s caution interview, in which he denied the allegations of incest and indecent assault. Another officer Sakenasa Leganimoce tendered the accused’s charge statement, in which the accused had refused to make a statement.

The accused gave unsworn evidence. He said he disagreed with the evidence of the two girls. The learned Magistrate then delivered his judgment. He warned himself on the dangers of convicting in the absence of corroboration, and although he considered the medical report to be corroboration in error, (it did not implicate the accused) he made it clear that he found PW1 to be a credible witness whose evidence was reliable even without corroboration. He convicted the accused on both counts and proceeded to sentence. In his sentencing remarks he said as follows:

“The accused as the complainants, grandfather, has seriously abused the trust his grandchildren placed on him. He knows that their father died in 1990 and it was absolutely essential for him to carefully look after his grandchildren.

Instead, he turned into a monster between the 1st of May, 1996 and 31st day of July, 1999 by having sexual intercourse with his granddaughter (i.e. complainant No 1) for more than forty to fifty occasions, she was aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of the abuse. The accused threatened the complainant not to tell anyone, otherwise he will kill her. In my view, the accused’s action on count No 1 deserved nothing less than the maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment on count 1”.

He also sentenced the accused to 3 years imprisonment on count 2 and ordered that they be served consecutively.

The Appeal

The Appellant appeals against this sentence on the ground that it is excessive in total. In particular he says that the learned Magistrate failed to take into account his advanced years (he is 67 years old) and his illnesses. He says that he suffers from ischemic heart disease, diabetes and scrotum enlargement.

Sentence:

State counsel conceded that the sentences on each count were excessive and exceeded the tariff for incest and indecent assault. In her well- researched submissions she suggested that the indecent assault offence should have led to a sentence of between 18 months and 2 years and that the incest offence should have led to a sentence of about 3 years.

I agree. Indeed leave was granted to the Appellant to appeal out of time on the basis that his sentence appeared to be longer than the established tariff for these offences

The maximum sentence for incest is 7 years imprisonment. In Viliame Tamani v State Crim App No HAC0007.2003, I adopted and applied the guidelines for sentencing in incest cases in, Attorney- General’s Guidelines Reference (No 1 of 7989) 90 Cr App R 141. Where the victim is over the age of 16 years and there is no plea of guilty sentences should range from a nominal penalty to 3 years imprisonment. Where the victim is aged between 13 and 16 years sentences should range between 3 years and 5 years depending on the harm to the child and the degree of corruption involved. Aggravating factors are the physical or psychological harm, the period of time over which the offending took place, the use of threats or violence, the incest being accompanied by acts of indecent assault, the pregnancy of the victim, and the fact that there are several victims. Mitigating factors may be a plea of guilty and the attitude of the victim.

In Tamani, I sentenced the accused to 3 years imprisonment on 6 counts of incest. All sentences were to be served concurrently.

In this case the victim was only 12 years old when the incest commenced and continued over 3 years. However there is only one count on the charge sheet. State counsel said that it was a “rolled up” count and that, in effect the Appellant was being sentenced for a continuing course of conduct. Sentencing on the basis of a specimen count is possible if the accused accepts and adopts the other offences with which he has not been specifically charged. In Sikeli Koro v State Crim App No HAA 0048 of 2002l, I considered the difficulties in sentencing in a case where there is a specimen charge, In Clark v R (1996) 2 Cr App R (S), the English Court of Appeal said that in such a case, the sentence must not sentence on the basis that the offender was guilty of other offences unless he had admitted those other offences. The Court said, at p356:

“......... the appellant was not convicted of the offences making up the series, non did he admit them or request the Court to take them into consideration. Therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that this appellant, having been convicted on a single count particularising a single act, and not having admitted any offence beyond that can only be sentenced on the basis of that single act.”

In this case the Appellant pleaded not guilty and there was no admission of the other offences of incest. In the circumstances, he can only be sentenced on the basis that he committed one act of incest between 1996 and 1998. Taking therefore, the first act of incest, the victim was only 12 years at that time. The act of incest was accompanied by the fondling of breasts, and vagina, and by acts of oral sexual intercourse. It was also accompanied by threats of death.

In the circumstances a starting point of 5 years imprisonment would be justified. There are no mitigating circumstances other than the Appellant’s age and illnesses. The aggravating circumstances are the threats of violence, the accompanying indecent acts, and the age of the victim. In all the circumstances a sentence of 4 years imprisonment is appropriate.

The tariff for indecent assault in Fiji is 1 to 4 years imprisonment in Mark Mutch v State Crim App No AAU0060.1999, four year sentences for indecent assault in the case of an adult assaulting girls between the ages of 9 and 15 were upheld by the Fiji Court of Appeal. The indecent assault involved penetration of the vagina by the appellant’s finger.

In this case, the evidence was of “checking” the victim’s vagina for a few minutes. A starting point of 2 years imprisonment is appropriate. The aggravating factors are that the victim was the Appellant’s granddaughter, she was 14 years old at the time of the offence, and that she suffered pain as a result of the assault Mitigating factors are the Appellant’s age and his illness. I arrive at a sentence of 3 years imprisonment.

In principle these sentences ought to be served consecutively, because they are in respect of two separate and distinct offences. However, I consider a total of 7 years imprisonment to be excessive in total for a 67-year-old man with continuing health problems. As I said in Ratu Penioni Rokota v The State Crim App No HAA0060 of 2002, special sentencing considerations apply to the sentencing of the elderly. As D.A. Thomas said in his “Principles of Sentencing” at p 196:

“Recognition of age as a mitigating factor does not mean that imprisonment should never be imposed on elderly offenders and the Court has upheld sentences of imprisonment on men in their seventies. It is however a long- established principle that a sentence should normally be shortened so as to avoid the possibility that the offender will not live to be released.” 

I therefore order that the sentences be served concurrently.

Result

The appeal against sentence succeeds. The sentence of 8 years imprisonment is quashed and is substituted by a sentence of 4 years imprisonment on Count 1 and 3 years imprisonment on count 2. They are to be served concurrently.

	1.	The accused has been convicted after a trial for one count of Attempted Rape contrary to section 151 of the Penal Code, Cap17. The judgment was delivered on 29 December 2008 in the presence of both parties. 

	2.	When the case was called for mitigation and sentencing submission the accused was not present and Noah was issued. 

	3.	Later the Court issued a bench warrant to arrest the accused and so far it has not been executed. From 06/06/2011 the accused is not appearing in this case and this shows that he is not interested in this matter. Also he has not filed any appeal against the judgment. 

	4.	Therefore when this was called before me I directed the learned state counsel to file the sentencing submission for this case and this was filed on 05 December 2013. 

	5.	Maximum penalty for this offence under the Penal Code is seven years imprisonment.

	6.	In Aunima v State [2001] FJHC 294; [2001] 1 FLR 213 (27 June 2001), Madam Justice Shameem highlighted the tariff for the offence of Attempted Rape stating:

'.....I find that the accepted tariff for Attempted Rape in the Fiji Courts ranges from 12 months imprisonment to 5 years imprisonment. A starting point should then be chosen according to the seriousness of the offending'.

	1.	In the case of State v Samoi [2010] FJHC 410; HAC093.2010S [6 August 2010] Justice Temo also relied on the tariff as was highlighted by Madam Justice Shameem in Aunima v State [Supra] in considering the sentence for the accused and stated that the actual sentence passed will depend on the aggravating and mitigating factors.

	2.	The aggravating factors are breach of trust as the victim was close to the accused and used to call him uncle, the age of the victim at that time and the age gap between the parties.

	3.	Mitigating factors are that the accused was married with children. The state failed to disclose any previous convictions against the accused and therefore he would be considered as a first offender. 

	4.	I select 02 years as my starting point and add 02 years for aggravating factors to reach 04 years. Deduct 01 year for mitigating factors to reach 03 years. 

	5.	Therefore the accused is sentenced to 03 years imprisonment for the offence of Attempted Rape contrary to section 151 of the Penal Code. I also fix a non parole period of 02 years. 

	6.	As the accused is absconding this sentence will be activated from the date of his apprehension. 

	7.	28 days to appeal.

77,724,80901,"JUDGMENT

[1] This is an appeal against sentence. On 28 July 2010, the appellant was charged with indecent assault contrary to section 212 of the Crimes Decree.

[2] On 7 December 2010, the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge after waiving his right to counsel. He was sentenced by the Magistrates' Court on the same day to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.

[3] The appellant says the sentence is harsh and excessive.

[4] The facts were that on 25 July 2010 the appellant returned home after drinking kava with his friends. He went to bed. He knew his daughter, the victim, was sleeping on his bed. His wife was away attending a funeral. At around 3am, the victim felt that somebody was touching her breast and genital area over her clothes. She woke up and saw that it was the appellant who was touching her. She pushed his hands away and walked out of the bedroom.

[5] At the time of the offence, the appellant was 47 years old. The victim was 16 years old and was a student.

[6] The appellant was arrested and interviewed under caution. He confessed to the offence to the police.

[7] In mitigation, the appellant told the learned Magistrate that he had four sons and one daughter. All of his children were attending school. He said he had sought forgiveness from his daughter. The prosecution tendered a letter from the victim stating that she had forgiven her father. The appellant had previous good character.

[8] The maximum penalty for indecent assault is 5 years imprisonment. The sentences range from 12 months to 4 years imprisonment, depending on the nature of the assault. 

[9] The higher range is justified if the assault is penetrative in nature and the victim is a child. Non-custodial sentence is only appropriate if the assault is a fleeting type. These guidelines were outlined by Shameem J in Rokota v State Crim. App. No. HAA008/02S. 

[10] In the present case, the learned Magistrate picked four years as a starting point. He used the fact that the appellant had breached the trust of his daughter to justify the higher starting point. The learned Magistrate then used the same fact as an aggravating factor to increase the sentence by one year. The sentence was reduced by two years to reflect the mitigating factors.

[11] There is an error of principle in the learned Magistrate's approach. Starting point should be picked without consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors. The reason for this is to avoid an offender being punished twice for the same conduct. 

[12] Breach of trust was, of course, an aggravating factor in this case. However, the learned Magistrate erred in considering the breach of trust to pick the higher range of the sentence and then use the same factor as a matter of aggravation to increase the sentence. The error justifies an intervention by this court. 

[13] Regard must be made to the circumstances of the offence. The assault was non penetrative. The victim had her clothes on when the assault took place. She was not threatened or physically injured during the assault.

[14] The middle range of 2 years imprisonment is an appropriate starting point. The sentence is increased to 3 years to reflect the breach of trust and reduced to 18 months for the guilty plea, remorse and previous good character of the appellant.

[15] The sentence of 3 years imprisonment is quashed and a sentence of 18 months imprisonment is substituted.

[16] The appeal is allowed.

78,725,74223,"SENTENCE

[1] On the 19th July in this Court the accused having been advised by the Legal Aid Commission, entered a plea of guilty to one count of rape. On the 22nd July 2013 he agreed the relevant facts and he was therefore found guilty and convicted.

[2] The charge was contrary to S.207 (1), 2(a) and (3) of the Crimes Decree 2009 and alleges that on a day in April 2011 in Lautoka, the accused had carnal knowledge of (name suppressed) without her consent.

[3] The facts of the case are that the accused aged 71 at the time was staying at the home of the victim aged 5, he being the stepfather of the victim's mother.

[4] On a day in April 2011 the accused and the young victim were in the victim's father's bedroom. The accused was kissing her and touching her vagina. This was witnessed by the victim's elder brother sitting on the stairs with a view into the room. A few days later this brother told their mother what he had seen. The mother questioned the girl who told her mother that the accused had touched her, kissed her and had put his ""moli""(penis) into her ""moli"" (vagina). It was very painful.

[5] The Police were informed and the child examined at Lautoka Hospital. The medical report noted that the hymen was torn with other signs of injury and the doctor concluded that the injury was consistent with blunt force such as a finger or penis.

[6] In an interview under caution the accused admitted that he had penetrated the victim with his fingers and had tried to insert his penis into her vagina.

[7] Rape of children are becoming much more common before the Court but that doesn't make it any less serious a crime. The tariff for rape of a child has been set by recent cases such as State v NK HAC 155 of 2010 and State v Simione Talenasila HAC 11 of 2010 to be 10 to 15 years imprisonment.

[8] In extensive written mitigation, Counsel for the accused tells me that he is now 74 years old and is very deaf. He is a widower with one daughter who is married with her own family. He explains that the offence came about when the victim climbed on to his shoulder to reach a bookshelf and he was overcome by lust.

[9] The aggravating features of this offending are the breach of trust in a domestic context and the enormous age difference (67 years). The Court must also take into account the psychological harm that has almost certainly been occasioned to the young victim.

[10] The mitigating features of this case are that:

	•	He is a first offender (which at 74 years of age is quite an achievement);
	•	He has entered a plea of guilty as soon as he was given legal advice;
	•	He is very remorseful;
	•	He co-operated with the authorities at the outset;
	•	His deafness will add to his hardship in prison;
	•	He has served 2 years and 2 months in remand;
	•	He is aged 74.

[11] In recognition of the sentencing authorities I take a starting point of 12 years imprisonment. For the aggravating features referred to in paragraph 9 above I add a further 6 years bringing the sentence up to 18 years. For his remorse, co-operation and deafness I deduct 6 years bringing the sentence back to 12 years.

[12] From that 12 years I deduct a full third to acknowledge his plea of guilty at first opportunity after receiving legal advice bringing his sentence down to 8 years.

[13] Whereas for a very young offender the Court would make allowances in reduction of sentence, this Court believes that an additional allowance should be made for a very elderly offender. While not detracting from the seriousness of this crime, a normal sentence for this crime could see the accused end his days in prison. Despite his utterly shameful behaviour he should still have the prospect of release from prison before his death, given that he has lived 74 years without a previous conviction. For the two years spent already in remand and as an act of mercy given his advanced age I further reduce the 8 year sentence to 5 years and that is the sentence that the accused will serve. He is to serve 4 years of that term before he is eligible for parole.

[14] While the sentence is well outside the accepted range, or ""tariff"" for rapes of children it is not to be taken as authority to pull the tariff down. It is a truly exceptional sentence in the circumstances and is passed as an act of mercy on a 74 year old who has pleaded guilty, has already served two years and is very remorseful.

[15] I make a Domestic Violence Restraining Order in favour of the victim against the accused as perpetrator.

Chitrasiri J:
 
 
Introduction
 
  
• The Petitioner was charged with one count of rape and two counts of indecent assault on an 8-year-old girl who is the daughter,born to his wife from her previous marriage. Before the trial commenced, the Petitioner pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault inflicted on the same victim. He was found guilty after trial, for the charge of rape and was convicted and sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years.
 
 
• Being aggrieved by the said decision of the High Court Judge, the Petitioner filed anapplication for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeal against the conviction, but nothing was filed challenging the sentence. The appeal came up before a single Judge of Appeal and itwas dismissed on the 08th April 2014in terms of section 35 (2) of the Court of Appeal Act stating that there were no arguable grounds to proceed with the petition of appeal.In that decision, the learned Judge has found that the appeal cannot possibly succeed on those groundsmentioned in the petition of appeal. 
 
 
• After a lapse of about 3 years and 8 months, the Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal on the 5th December 2017 in the Supreme Courtseeking to have the decision of the Court of Appeal reversed.
 
 
• Even though the Petition of Appeal consist of 12 grounds of appeal, in the submissions filed on his behalf, the petitioner has decided to restrict his appeal only to the grounds 8, 9 and 10 mentioned therein. In that Notice of Appeal, the Petitioner also has raised seven grounds of appeal against the sentenceimposed on him. As mentioned before, it is important to note that no appeal was filed against the sentence when he challenged the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. Hence, those grounds against the sentence have been raised by the petitioner for the first time in the Supreme Courtandwere neverargued in the Court of Appeal.
 
 
• The aforesaid grounds of appeal are reproduced herein below: 
 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION
 
  
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to direct the assessors to determine whether they considered the caution statement to be true and reliable in whole or in part and consider its contents with all the other evidence the Appellant mention in the trial which open to be heard by the assessors, the state/s counsel, the Judge and again the police officers who had interviewed him (Burns vs- R (1975) 132 CLR 25.
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to refer to such caution statement and direct the assessors that it must be satisfied that he said statement proves the relevant element beyond reasonable doubt.
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to commenting to the assessors that such caution statement is the only evidence, or the most significant evidence in proof of the element and can only satisfied of the element beyond reasonable doubt it they are satisfied of the caution statement.
 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE
 
  
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to deduct the accused’s remand period when sentencing the accused to 14 years imprisonment.
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a proper sentencing imprisonment term to the accused who was a first offender.
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact when he failed to give a proper discount on the accused mitigation and as such denied the accused who was unpresented and lack of the knowledge of the law and that when the Department of the Legal Aid withdrew from representing the accused.
 
 
• That the Appellant appeals against sentence being manifestly harsh and excessing and wrong in principal in all the circumstances of the case.
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact in taking irrelevant matters into consideration when sentencing the appellant and not taking into relevant consideration.
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact in not taking into consideration the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 when sentencing the Appellant. 
 
 
• That the learned trial Judge erred in law and in fact in the Sentencing when he imposed the non-parole period too closed to the head sentence as such denying and discouraging the rehabilitation (Please view case authority of TORA v STATE)
 

 Appeal against the conviction
 
  
• The aforesaid 3 grounds of appeal against the conviction are directed towards the manner in which the cautionary statement of the petitioner was dealt with by the trial judge when he directed the assessors. The learned counsel for the petitioner quoting from the trial Judge’s directions to the assessors has stated that there were no proper directions regarding the cautionary statement to assess the evidence for the assessors to get at the truth. He also has stated that the trial Judge in his summing up has simply stated that it is a matter ultimately up to the assessors and has insisted upon the assessors that it is their responsibility to consider the explanation offered by the petitioner. Accordingly, he submits that there were no proper directions from the trial Judge, directing the assessors to ascertain the truth. 
 
 
• In support of his argument, learned counsel for the petitioner in his submissions has referred to the following decisions:
 

Vakacereivalu v State [2015] AAU 116 of 2011 
 
Noa Maya v The State No. CAV 009 of 2005
 
Chan Wei Keung v The Queen [1967] 2AC 160
 
Colati v State CAV 0026 of 2016
 
  
• Having cited those authorities, the learned counsel in his submissions has quoted paragraphs 15, 16 and 24 in the summing up andhas argued that there were no clear directions to the assessors regardingthe weight that should be given to the caution interview statement of the petitioner. He, hasfurthersubmitted that without having clear direction to the assessors, the verdict that was returned would amount to miscarriage of justice. Contents of thoseparagraphs in the summing up read as follows:
 

“...The Accused does not dispute that he gave the answers recorded but he says that they are not true and he only gave those answers because he was told to. You will have to consider that explanation.”
 
 
“He accepts that he told the police that he had penetrated Mafi’s vagina; he explains that by saying that the police told him to follow what had had said and to agree with it and the rest was for him to explain to the Judge. He said that his admissions to the police are not true, but what he said after he has been charged is the truth. He said that one of the police officers spoke to him alone and when that police officer read out the caution interview he told the police officer that some of the things written in it were not correct but he was told by the officer that he had to follow what was written.”
 
 
11, In his directions to the assessors, learned trial Judge has stated that it is a matter which ultimately falls on them and thattheyare to consider the explanation offered by the petitioner. Therefore,it is seen that the trial Judge has directed the assessors to consider carefully the explanation offered by the petitioner though he has failed to itemize separately, the important areas in the cautionary statement. In paragraph 16 of the summing up he has stated as follows:
 
 
“Following the discussion with the accused it was apparent that his case was that the interviewing officer told him to agree with the account given by Mafi and that is what he did although the account that he was giving was not true. The accused does not dispute that he gave the answers recorded but he says that they are not true and he only gave those answers because he was told to. You will have to consider that explanation”.
 
  
• It is not incorrect to say that merelydirecting the assessors to consider the explanation given by an accused person to the police without explaining the facts and circumstances connected therewith,is not a proper direction. Trial judge must explain to the assessors all the facts and circumstances that led to make the cautionary statement.He also mustexplain the contents of the cautionary statement in simple language enabling the assessors to arrive at the correct verdict.
 
 
• However, at this stageit is important to note that there is ample evidence to confirm what the petitioner had said in his caution interview. Admission by the petitioner in his caution interview statement of raping the victim is clearly consistent with the medical evidence of the doctor who examined her. This position is further confirmed by the evidence of the complainant Mafi as well. Under such a backdrop only, the assessors were to consider the weight that is to be given to the caution interview statement.
 
 
• In this regard, the Supreme Court in Lepani Varani v State [2016 FJSC 36: CAV 0013.2016 had held thus:
 

“The Court of Appeal according to the above passages dealt with the argument regarding the absence of a direction by the trial Judge regarding the weight and truth of the confession comprehensively. The Court was of the view that there was sufficient evidence of the trial which gave weight to the truth of the confession once the voluntariness was accepted by the Assessors.”
 
  
• In this instance,the position taken up by the petitioner is that even though he admitted committing the offence in his caution interview statement, those admissions were not true. However, the fact remains that the assessors were to consider such a position along with the evidence given by theother witnesses as well. Therefore,when looking at the totality of the evidence recorded in this case, it is my opinion that no miscarriage of justice had been caused even though there had been a few infirmities in the directions given to the assessors by the learned trial Judge. Accordingly, I am inclined to answer the questions of law raised against the conviction in favour of the State.
 

Appeal against the Sentence
 
  
• Grounds upon which the sentence was appealed against has already been mentioned hereinbefore. There are 7 grounds, thatthe petitioner has mentioned. However, the Counsel for the petitioner in his oral and written submissions restricted the appeal against the sentence only to the first ground namely, the failure of the judges in the lower courts to look at the period of remand that the petitioner had been in, before the sentence was passed on him. Of course, no appeal was argued challenging the sentence in the Court of Appeal for the Judge to consider. I will be dealing with this issue of not raising in the Court of Appeal any ground of appeal against the sentence, later in this judgment.
 
 
• The record maintained in the Magistrates’ Court show that the order to remand the petitioner had been first made on the 4th of August 2010 (page 209 of the High Court Record). He was sentenced to imprisonment on 10thDecember 2010 by the learned High Court judge sitting at Suva High Court (page 16a of the High Court Record). There is no record to show that he was released on bail within the period in between. Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner had been on remand for 4 months and 6 days prior to being sentenced.
 
 
• I have carefully looked at the sentence passed on the petitioner. I am unable to find any consideration of the period of remand that the petitioner has served, in the sentence passed by the High Court Judge. Learned counsel for the State argued that the learned trial judge had considered the period of remand when the petitioner was sentenced referring particularly to the last paragraph of the sentence and it reads thus:
 

“For the offence of rape of an 8-year-old girl, I must pass a sentence upon you that properly reflects the complete abhorrence that members of the public feel towards adults who abuse young children in their care. In my judgment, for such an offence, even following a plea of guilty, a sentence in the region of 10 years would be appropriate. You have denied yourself the mitigation of a guilty plea and the only mitigation available to you is the fact of your previous good character. I have summarized the aspects of the offence that increase the seriousness of it and I pass upon you consequence a sentence of 15 years reduced to 14 years by your good character; the non-parole period will be 11 years.”(emphasis added)
 
  
• This paragraph shows that it is only the previous character of the petitioner that had been considered as a mitigatory factor when passing the sentence. He has never made any reference to Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009 in whichthe requirement to consider the period of remand served by an offender at the time of sentencing is clearly mentioned. The said section stipulates as follows:
 

“24. If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, any period of time during which the offender was held in custody prior to the trial of the matter or matters shall, unless a court otherwise orders, be regarded by the court as a period of imprisonment already served by the offender.”
 
  
• No consideration,as referred to in the aforesaid provision of the law,has been made by the learned High Court Judge. Even in the last paragraph in the sentence, it does not indicate that the trial judge has independently considered the period of remand that the petitioner had undergone. Therefore, it is clear that the learned trial judge has misdirected himself as to the contents in Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act 2009. 
 
 
• Now the question arises whether such an error could be rectified by the Supreme Court when no appeal had been filed in the Court of Appeal challenging the sentence imposed on the petitioner. Section 14 of the Supreme Court Act 1998 stipulates that the Supreme Court is vested with all the power and authority of the Court of Appeal in relation to matters that come before it, and that power and authority may be exercised, with such modifications as are necessary according to the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, Section 7 (1) (c) of the said Act of 1998 empowers the Supreme Court to grant special leave and to make such other orders as the circumstances of the case require.Also,in sub section (2) (c) of the same Section 7of the Supreme Court Act gives the power to the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal in order to prevent substantial and grave injustice being caused to an appellant. Therefore, particularly in order to ascertain whether there had been any injustice being caused to the petitioner, I am inclined to consider the merits of the appeal filed against the sentence despite the fact that there had been no appeal filed canvassing the sentence imposed on the petitioner.
 
 
• This finding is supported by the decision in Eroni Vaqewa v The State [2016] FJSC 12; CAV 0016 of 2015. In that decision Supreme Court having recognised the power to entertain fresh grounds of appeal which were not taken up in a court below has mentioned that such power will not be exercised unless its significance upon the special leave criteria was compelling. This same criterion had been followed in the case of Anthony v State Criminal Petition CAV 028 of 2016 as well. Indeed, in Pauliasi Nacagilevu v The State; CAV 0023 of 2015,it was stated that, in fairness to the petitioner we decide to consider this ground (which was not argued in the court below) briefly to examine whether there is any merit in this ground of appeal.
 

I believe the reasons referred to in paragraph 17of this judgment referred to above would justify this court looking at the fresh ground urged by the appellant i.e. not considering the period of remand, the petitioner had served at the time the sentence was passed. 
 
  
• Failure to consider the period of remand served by the petitioner in this instance is a serious errorsince it amounts to noncompliance of Section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Act. Therefore, if such an error is not rectified even at this stage, it would lead to miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, in order to see the ends of justice, I would think this Court should intervene and remedy the situation.
 
 
• Next issue that arises is whether it is correct to entertain this appeal despite the delay in filing the same. In terms of Rule 5 made under the Supreme Court Act 1998, a party aggrieved by a decision of the Court of Appeal shall lodge an appeal, supported by a petition and affidavit in the Court Registry, within 42 days of the date of the decision from which leave to appeal is sought. In this instance, the decision of the Court of Appeal had been made on the 8th April 2014. The notice of appeal had been received by the Registry on 17 December 2017. Accordingly, there was a delay of about 3 years and 8 months when filing this appeal. Then the question arises whether or not this Court should consider the merits of this appeal despite the said delay when filing this appeal. 
 
 
• In the case of Kumar v State and Sinu v State, [2012] FJSC17CAV 001 of 2009 21st August 2012,Supreme Court has stated as follows:
 

“We therefore have no difficulty in holding that this Court is indeed possessed of jurisdiction to grant enlargement of time in appropriate cases for the late lodgment of application for special leave to appeal”.
 
 
 Also, in the case of Rasaku and Momoivalu v The State [2013] FJSC 4; CAV 0009 of 2013, it was held that:
 
 
 “We therefore have no difficulty in holding that this Court is indeed possessed of jurisdiction to grant enlargement of time in appropriate cases for the late lodgment of application for special leave to appeal.”
 
  
• According to counsel for the petitioner, the delay in filing the appeal was that the petitioner had beendetained at a distant prison in Levuka which has no facility to prepare the necessary papers to lodge an appeal. According to him, the petitioner had been an inmate for about 1 year in the prison at Levuka and then he was taken to the prison in Korovou. After he was brought to Korovou prison only, he was able to prepare the appeal papers. Moreover, the failure to consider the period that the petitioner was to serve in remand amounts to an error. Therefore, to my mind this is a fit case for the Supreme Court to intervene disregarding the delay in filing the appeal.
 
 
• In the circumstances, I find that the requirement referred to in Section 7(2) of the Supreme Court Act in order to grant leave to appeal exists in this appeal filed against the sentence. Therefore, upon considering the failure to deduct the period that the petitioner was in remand when the sentence was passed on him, I am inclined to grant leave to proceed with the appeal filed against the sentence. Accordingly, I make order that the period of imprisonment imposed on the petitioner should be reduced by 4 months which period, the petitioner was in remand custody.
 

Orders of the Court
 
  
• Leave to appeal against the conviction is refused.
 
• Leave to appeal against the sentence is granted.
 
• Sentence of imprisonment imposed on the petitioner is to be reduced by four (4) months.
 
• Accordingly, the sentence imposed on the accused/petitioner shall read as 13 years and 08 months imprisonment and the non-parole period to remain as 11 years.
